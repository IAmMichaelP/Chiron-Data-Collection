https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-15-teacher-settlement-preferred-prounouns-seismic-implications.html,Former teacher awarded settlement in “preferred pronouns” lawsuit with “seismic implications” for freedom from LGBT tyranny,"A Virginia schoolteacher who was fired from his job for refusing to address his transgender students using their ""preferred pronouns"" has won a settlement in a lawsuit he filed against the school board. Peter Vlaming, formerly an employee of the West Point School District, received a $575,000 payout, which one right-leaning media outlet said has ""seismic implications"" for the rest of Virginia's educational system as the transgender virus continues to spread far and wide. Vlaming was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) whose president and CEO Kristen Waggoner issued a statement about how her organization is ""grateful that, because of this decision, tolerance is now a two-way street, not a one-way ratchet for totalitarian ideology."" ""It protects all teachers in Virginia and its rationale should guide other courts addressing similar issues,"" she added about the settlement ruling. (Related: Did you hear about Irish teacher Enoch Burke who was arrested recently for refusing to address one of his male students as ""she"" and ""her?"") ADF representing other teachers in same boat Vlaming is hardly the only teacher to face mistreatment for refusing to play ball with the Cult of LGBT. Many other teachers, including some who are represented by the ADF in other states, face similar persecution for doing what is right. ""No teacher should be fired for living according to their [sic] beliefs or protecting their students,"" Waggoner wrote on X / Twitter. ""But that's exactly what happened to Peter Vlaming. So we sued. And won."" In addition to receiving a $575,000 cash settlement, the West Point School District's board also cleared Vlaming's termination from his employment record as well as altered its policies on gender pronoun tyranny to comply with the updated Virginia education policies established by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin. The West Point School District clearly violated Vlaming's right to free speech – or in this case, his right to not be forced to utter someone else's preferred speech. As such, the school district was held accountable in a court of law for this infringement. ""Peter wasn't fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn't say,"" commented senior counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, in a statement. ""The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law."" ""As a teacher, Peter was passionate about the subject he taught, was well-liked by his students, and did his best to accommodate their needs and requests. But he couldn't in good conscience speak messages that he knew were untrue, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason. We're pleased to favorably settle this case on behalf of Peter and hope other government and school officials will take note of the high cost involved in failing to respect an American's constitutionally protected freedoms."" Before winning the settlement, Vlaming's case was tossed by a judge in the King William Circuit Court who declared that Vlaming, a Christian, should not be protected because there is no ""valid reason for the law to accept his suit."" Virginia Commonwealth Supreme Court Justice D. Arthur Kelsey later overturned that ruling, writing that Vlaming had valid ""constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims"" on his former employer. ""Examining only the allegations in Vlaming's complaint, the circuit court dismissed Vlaming's claims, finding that they failed to state legally viable causes of action. Disagreeing with the circuit court, we reverse and remand for further proceedings,"" Justice Kelsey said. In speaking to the media about his victory, Vlaming said he is ""relieved"" that his rights of freedom of expression and freedom of religion were ultimately upheld.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-15-ny-students-stage-walkout-against-trans-athletes.html,New York high schoolers to stage WALKOUTS in protest of ballot measure that will allow trans athletes to participate in girls’ sports,"High school students across New York are planning to walk out of their classrooms on Oct. 24 in protest of a ballot measure that would allow transgender athletes to participate in girls' sporting events. New York's Proposal 1, also known as the ""Equal Rights Amendment,"" would add language to the New York Bill of Rights to provide that people can't be denied rights based on their ""ethnicity, national origin, age and disability"" as well as due to their ""sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare and autonomy."" Campaigners in favor of Proposal 1 are marketing the ballot measure as a pro-abortion measure that would enshrine abortion rights into state law. However, the Coalition to Protect Kids, the main organization that has organized the statewide walkouts, argue that Proposal 1 would not only protect abortion rights but also mandate extreme ""trans rights"" in New York , including the participation of transgender athletes in girls sports. The statewide demonstration, dubbed "" Walk Off for Fairness Day ,"" is organized by the Coalition to Protect Kids with support from the Catholic Church, the New York Republican State Committee and the Conservative Party of New York State. (Related: World Athletics bans transgender athletes from competing in female category at international events .) ""Girls are being systematically canceled in this state, and 'Walk Off for Fairness Day' will give them a safe opportunity to make their voices heard,"" said Coalition spokeswoman Ayesha Kreutz. ""So many of these young women are afraid of speaking out, so they're forced to watch as 50 years of female athletic progress gets washed away by destructive ideologues. Girls are not second-class citizens, so why are they being treated that way?"" Many high school students across New York have spoken out in support of the walkout. ""It's not right for boys to compete against girls in sports. It's a huge disadvantage for girls,"" said Hannah Pompeo, a 16-year soccer player at Eden High School near Buffalo. Similarly, Millie McCormack, a dancer from Somers High School, stated that she and her sister would join the protest because they believe transgender athletes threaten the fairness of girls' sports. ""I don’t think it’s right for men to be in our safe spaces. We worked hard for places on our teams. Boys have physical advantages we don't have."" Proposal 1 would undermine Title IX protections for female athletes The issue and the event have ignited strong reactions from both sides of the political aisle. Proposal 1 supporters, like Sasha Ahuja of New Yorkers for Equal Rights, accuse the coalition of misrepresenting the amendment to scare voters. ""There's no bigger bully than the Coalition to Protect Kids – lying to students and parents to scare them into turning on each other,"" said Ahuja. ""Prop 1 is about protecting abortion permanently and preventing government discrimination, full stop — and they know it. In their desperation to make this amendment about anything else, the Coalition to Protect Kids is doing anything but."" However, State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox warned that Proposal 1 could undermine Title IX protections for female athletes. ""The Prop 1 ballot amendment would roll back the protections guaranteed to women and girls under Title IX of the Education Amendments signed into law by President Nixon over 50 years ago by giving biological males a constitutional right to compete on girls' teams and taking away the scholarships and playing time these young women have worked so hard for,"" said state Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox. Meanwhile, Conservative Party Chairman Gerry Kassar argued that girls' sports should remain exclusive to girls. ""It's hard to believe we're even having the conversation that girls' sports would be for anyone other than girls. We fully support 'Walk Off for Fairness Day' in New York, reminding young people that there is safety in numbers. Girls Sports must remain Girls Sports, and there should be nothing controversial in that statement,"" Kassar said. Follow GenderConfused.com for more news about transgender athletes.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-15-black-cumin-extraordinary-herb-that-promotes-wellness.html,BLACK CUMIN: An extraordinary herb that promotes wellness across multiple body systems,"Ancient superseed black cumin ( Nigella sativa) has been known for a bevy of health benefits . This extraordinary herb is rich in bioactive compounds that promote wellness across multiple body systems. A powerful antioxidant that protects cells The antioxidants found in black cumin, especially a key bioactive compound thymoquinone, help protect your cells by reducing harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These unstable molecules can cause damage to your cells. Research has shown that black cumin can boost your body's defenses by increasing important antioxidant enzymes like catalase, glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Think of these enzymes as your body's cleanup crew – they work to protect cells from damage caused by stress and toxins in the environment. Nature's anti-inflammatory ally Inflammation is your body's way of fighting infections or injuries. However, when it lasts too long (chronic inflammation), it can lead to various health problems. Black cumin and thymoquinone can help reduce inflammation by lowering the levels of certain molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are responsible for triggering inflammation. A seed with natural immune-boosting power Research shows that black cumin and thymoquinone may be effective natural immune boosters . They can help improve the function of macrophages (a type of white blood cell that cleans up debris and fights off germs), regulate inflammation and enhance immune responses in both animals and humans. This means black cumin seeds could be a beneficial part of strategies for supporting immune health. More clinical trials are needed to better understand how black cumin works and how it can be used to improve immune function. Protection against neurological disorders Black cumin and thymoquinone show promise in treating various brain-related conditions , including acute brain injury, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia. Thymoquinone helps reduce brain inflammation by boosting levels of antioxidants, like glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase. At the same time, it lowers harmful molecules that cause inflammation in brain immune cells called microglia. In Alzheimer's disease , which is marked by harmful proteins that damage brain cells (amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation), thymoquinone has protective effects. It helps restore antioxidant levels and reduces the production of damaging molecules, Thymoquinone also offers protection against the inflammation and cell damage associated with Parkinson's disease, which involves the loss of neurons that produce dopamine – a chemical crucial for motivation, movement and pleasure or reward. Anticancer effects of black cumin Research shows that black cumin and thymoquinone may have anticancer properties . They work by boosting the body's antioxidant defenses, influencing important signaling pathways and enhancing the effects of traditional cancer treatments. This suggests that black cumin could be a valuable option for cancer prevention and treatment. However, more clinical studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness in treating cancer. Anti-obesity and antihyperlipidemic effect of black cumin Obesity and dyslipidemia – the abnormal level of fats (cholesterol or triglycerides) in the blood – are significant risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease that contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies underscores the potential of black cumin as a promising candidate for anti-obesity and antihyperlipidemic therapies. While these findings are encouraging, further research is needed to explain the biochemical and molecular mechanisms behind its anti-obesity effects . Antidiabetic effects of black cumin Diabetes is a long-term condition caused by problems with how your body makes or uses insulin – leading to high blood sugar levels. It can result in complications like eye damage (retinopathy), kidney damage (nephropathy) and nerve damage (neuropathy). It is also linked to high cholesterol, inflammation and oxidative stress (cells caused by free radicals). In traditional medicine, Nigella sativa and its essential oil have been used to manage diabetes. Recent studies have shown that silver nanoparticles made from black cumin seed extract can improve diabetes-related nerve damage by boosting brain growth, reducing inflammation and restoring the body's natural antioxidant defenses. Cardioprotective and blood pressure-lowering effects of black cumin Studies show that using black cumin after a heart injury – like when blood flow is cut off and then restored – can help the heart function better by reducing damage caused by oxidative stress. This is important in real-life situations where the heart can get hurt when blood flow returns after being blocked. In animal studies, black cumin has also shown the ability to lower high blood pressure caused by a substance called angiotensin II. This suggests that black cumin could be a natural way to help combat high blood pressure. Protection against skin diseases Hydroethanolic extracts of black cumin have been shown to help heal 20 to 40 percent of skin wounds in diabetic rats compared to those not receiving the treatment. This healing effect is likely due to the extract's anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Research also indicates that black cumin can help reduce symptoms of acne vulgaris, which involves blocked and inflamed pores. For example, topical gels made with black cumin seed extract have been found to significantly inhibit the growth of bacteria like S. aureus and P. acnes , which are commonly associated with acne. Further, in a clinical study involving over 30 patients with vitiligo (a skin condition that causes patches of skin to lose color), the best results in skin repigmentation were seen on the face, hands and genital areas when a cream containing black cumin oil was applied in the morning and evening. Overall, the evidence suggests that black cumin is a promising natural remedy for various skin conditions, including acne vulgaris, vitiligo and wound healing. Its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties are key to these beneficial effects. Role of black cumin in lung disorders Black cumin seed extracts, essential oils and thymohydroquinone have shown protective effects against lung damage caused by various harmful substances, including bieomyxin, cadmium, cigarette smoke, lipopolysaccharides and nicotine. Treatment with black cumin preparations has been found to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and cell death in these cases. Black cumin also has antihistamine properties (which help reduce allergy symptoms), bronchodilator effects (helping to open up airways) and immune-boosting qualities. These benefits have been observed in both clinical trials and lab studies – suggesting that black cumin may help manage asthma and other lung disorders. Overall, the evidence indicates that black cumin and its extracts have significant potential for preventing and managing lung disorders, particularly through their anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory and immune-supporting effects. While the positive results from various studies are encouraging, more large-scale and well-designed trials are needed to better understand how black cumin works and its role in lung health. Future research should also look at the long-term effects, the best dosages and how black cumin may interact with standard asthma treatments to determine its viability in managing lung diseases. Hepatoprotective effects of black cumin Black cumin has shown promise in helping to reverse fatty liver disease and improve cholesterol levels. Clinical trials indicate that it can significantly lower blood triglycerides and liver enzymes, which are markers of liver health. Treatment with black cumin also leads to a decrease in inflammatory markers while increasing levels of good cholesterol. However, these studies have been short and lack detailed investigations into how black cumin works. They also did not use advanced diagnostic methods like liver biopsies or MRIs. While thymoquinone is recognized as a key active ingredient that contributes to liver protection, more clinical trials studying thymoquinone for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are needed. Overall, black cumin appears to have strong protective effects on the liver and potential as a treatment option for various liver diseases , including NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is more severe. Its ability to reduce fat buildup, inflammation and oxidative stress, along with positive results from clinical studies, highlights its promise for managing liver health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-14-harvard-lied-data-14k-minors-transitioned-lgbt.html,"Harvard LIED: Data shows nearly 14,000 U.S. minors were “transitioned” (i.e. mutilated) to LGBT between 2019 and 2023","New research by the public advocacy group Do No Harm has found that between the years of 2019 and 2023, a total of 13,994 minors across the United States received ""gender-affirming care,"" which for more than 5,700 of them included body butchery in the form of transgender surgery. Debunking a Harvard University study from back in June that claims there is ""little to no utilization of gender-affirming surgeries by transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) minors in the U.S.,"" Do No Harm's research proves once and for all that LGBT perversion has reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of the innocence being targeted by its doctrines. Millions of American children these days are being bombarded day in and day out with LGBT perversion at school, in media and online. Many of these kids end up believing the lies they are told by their teachers, politicians and Hollywood actors about the gender ""spectrum,"" prompting them to lob off body parts and take hormone-destroying pharmaceuticals in order to become their ""true selves."" After analyzing insurance claims filed nationwide, Do No Harm found that 5,747 unique patients received gender-affirming surgery, which includes things like mastectomies and genital reassignment. A whopping 8,519 minors were prescribed puberty blockers and / or hormone replacement therapy during this same time period, which all in all saw more than 60,000 total prescriptions written for LGBT transitioning drugs. The total amount of all insurance claims filed between 2019 and 2023 for ""gender-affirming care"" was found to be $119 million. Do No Harm put together a searchable database that parents can use to see what more than 225 hospitals across the country have been doing to underage youth in recent years. (Related: Did you know that Kamala Harris is a proud supporter and promoter of transgender child mutilation and degenerate LGBT perversion?) Is your state a sanctuary for LGBT child mutilations? The worst states where the most child body butchery is taking place include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington, as well as Washington, D.C. The following states also allow for minors to receive ""gender-affirming care:"" Alaska Hawaii Oregon Nevada Montana Kansas Arkansas Illinois Wisconsin Michigan Florida Virginia Maryland Pennsylvania New Jersey New York Delaware Vermont Maine The following states have limits or prohibitions in place for minor ""gender-affirming care:"" Arizona Utah Idaho Wyoming Texas Oklahoma Nebraska South Dakota North Dakota Iowa Missouri Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Georgia South Carolina North Carolina Tennessee Kentucky Indiana West Virginia Rhode Island New Hampshire Keep in mind that Do No Harm's researchers were extremely conservative in their estimates. Chances are that there are many more children out there whose bodies have been destroyed by LGBT transitioning procedures and drugging that were not captured in the research. ""We've really been meticulous in trying to make sure that the data are as clear as possible and are as accurate as possible,"" said Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, Do No Harm's chairman. Many of them may not feel this way now, but LGBT mutilation is something that the vast majority of transgenders will come to regret, especially if they ""transitioned"" while underage. ""The eugenicists, neo-Malthusians, nihilists, and ecofreaks are jumping up and down as they achieve their mission to eliminate the human race and stop people from reproducing,"" one commenter wrote about this modern-day horror show. ""Those who push this on children should be jailed,"" wrote another.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-14-va-teacher-fired-misgendering-gets-575k-settlement.html,Virginia teacher axed for MISGENDERING student gets $575K settlement from school district that fired him,"A teacher in Virginia who was fired for ""misgendering"" a biologically female student is set to receive a $575,000 settlement . Peter Vlaming, who teaches French at West Point Public Schools (WPPS) in West Point, was originally fired in 2018 after referring to a female student as ""she"" while the latter was absent. The said student was reportedly exhibiting gender confusion and insisting that the pronouns ""he/him"" be used. The student requested a meeting with Vlaming when she heard of his actions. The meeting did push through with Vlaming, the student and her parents in attendance. One of the student's parents urged him to ""leave his principles and beliefs out of this"" and just use male pronouns to refer to the girl. The principal instructed Vlaming to ""do whatever the parents ask,"" and the assistant principal sent him documents from the National Center for Transgender Equality concerning ""pronoun usage."" But the teacher couldn't bring himself to lie and was reported for misgendering a second time, prompting the parents of the gender-confused student to pull her out of his class. For this, Vlaming was slapped with a one-month suspension while WPPS reviewed his conduct to determine whether it violated the school district's ""harassment or retaliation"" policy. WPPS Superintendent Laura Abel mandated Vlaming to use male pronouns for the student ""regardless of location or context, even outside of school."" When Vlaming indicated he could not comply with such a request ""in good conscience,"" the school board fired him in December 2018 for allegedly violating the WPPS non-discrimination policy. He sued WPPS and several of its officials in 2019, with the help of the pro-liberty legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). (Related: High school teacher FIRED for refusing to play along with the transgender delusion now afflicting modern society .) WPPS opts to settle instead of challenging the lawsuit According to a September 2019 article by the College Fix , Vlaming's lawsuit accused the defendants of breach of contract and violations of various rights guaranteed by the Old Dominion's laws. He requested the court to order his reinstatement to the same position at the same or higher salary. Vlaming also sought an injunction against school officials punishing teachers for referring to students ""based on their biological sex."" But instead of challenging the lawsuit, WPPS settled with the plaintiffs. According to an ADF press release, Vlaming's settlement with the school district consists of $575,000 in damages and lawyer's fees and the expungement of his December 2018 termination from his record. The school board also agreed to ""change its policies to conform to the new Virginia education policies established by [Republican] Gov. Glenn Youngkin that respect fundamental free speech and parental rights."" ""[Vlaming] wasn't fired for something he said,"" remarked Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF's Center for Academic Freedom. ""He was fired for something he couldn't say."" ""[He] couldn't in good conscience speak messages that he knew were untrue, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason. The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law,"" Langhofer added. Jose Alberto Nino of Big League Politics pointed out that ""schools in the U.S. are total cesspools of leftist degeneracy,"" with both students and teachers unable to exercise their free speech rights ""out of fear of getting severely reprimanded."" He continued: ""The current education system in the U.S. is simply inadequate and must be completely overhauled."" ""This starts by using punitive measures to fire teachers and administrators who push degeneracy. At the same time, alternative education modules such as homeschooling, private schooling, charter schools, etc. should be promoted."" Head over to CampusInsanity.com for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-14-200-hospitals-providing-irreversible-transgender-procedures-children.html,"More than 200 U.S. hospitals, healthcare facilities perform irreversible transgender procedures on CHILDREN","Election Day is fast approaching and one of the left's claims about childhood transgenderism is getting debunked as the truth comes out about the prevalence of youth body butchery at U.S. hospitals and healthcare facilities. The latest figures show that more than 200 hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States offer irreversible transgender procedures to underage kids, defying the leftist claim that minors are not being experimented on by the LGBT body butchers. The Do No Harm medical nonprofit watchdog group launched a database this week that tracks which hospitals and healthcare facilities offer sex-change surgeries, hormone therapies, and puberty blockers to children. As of this writing, there are 225 facilities on the list. Do No Harm did the heavy lifting of putting together the database by pairing gender-related transition codes within the medical system to gender-related procedures and prescription codes at the various facilities. ""The database provides conclusive proof that these interventions are happening on children across the country, both hormonal interventions and surgeries,"" commented Beth Serio, a registered nurse who works as Do No Harm's external relations manager. ""We used bulletproof data from insurance claims databases to show that these procedures have been done on children."" (Related: Speaking of children who are being sexually abused, did you know that the Buzbee law firm out of Texas has identified dozens of child victims of rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs?) Between 2019 and 2023, the bodies of 14,000 American children were butchered by LGBT industry After analyzing thousands of insurance claims at hospitals and pediatric facilities across the country, Do No Harm learned that a shocking 14,000 American children had their bodies butchered by the LGBT industry between 2019 and 2023. ""It's a common lie in the trans industry in America that these procedures are very highly reversible, that there's no long-term effects,"" Serio added about the mass deception that influenced these children to destroy their bodies. ""We know that's simply not the case, especially for children who are taking the hormones for a longer period of time. Some of them can have a sterilizing effect on children, especially when taken for a lengthy period of time."" Of those 14,000 children catalogued, nearly 6,000 of them underwent extreme transgender surgeries while 8,579 were given hormone drugs and puberty blockers that damage the endocrine system, potentially for life. ""We only included data that we could stand behind 100 percent, based on [Do No Harm's] analysis of insurance claims data,"" Serio further explained about how her group put together the database. ""We cannot account for things such as cash or self-pay patients, or a couple of insurance companies who don't report to these databases. As staggering as these numbers are, we're pretty confident that there are even more children that have been impacted by these barbaric treatments."" Transgender body butchery seems to be a rich people thing, especially when it involves children. American families spent more than $119 million during that same timeframe to ""transition"" their children into LGBT abominations. At the top of the list for worst-offending facilities is the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, also known as CHOP – the infamous vaccine pusher Paul Offit is an attending physician at CHOP's Division of Infectious Disease, by the way. CHOP saw 122 child sex-change patients during those years. Five of the children underwent extreme surgeries while 117 are taking hormone-replacement regimens and puberty blockers to try to become another gender. All in all, CHOP wrote 768 ""gender-affirming care"" prescriptions during that timeframe, all of which totaled nearly $231,000 in submitted charges that ultimately benefit Big Pharma and the sickness-for-profit industry. Transgenderism is an abomination, especially when a child's body gets butchered by it. Learn more at Transhumanism.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-14-fema-disaster-equity-lgbtq-rescued-others-ignored.html,FEMA’s “disaster equity” focus means LGBTQ people get rescued while others are ignored,"When Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not have the funds that it needs to get through the hurricane season in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, many Americans were outraged. The fact that the agency ended up in a position where it cannot support American taxpayers because it spent hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal aliens is bad enough, but now we are learning that the help they do provide is dispensed according to woke guidelines rather than need. A virtual meeting held by the agency has recently come to light in which FEMA Emergency Management Specialist Tyler Atkins announced that the agency was prioritizing individuals who consider themselves LGBTQ because he says they are “already disadvantaged.” He said: “They already have their own things to deal with. So you add a disaster on top of that, it’s just compounding on itself.” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Senior Emergency Management Specialist Maggie Jarry then took over the conversation , saying that instead of helping as many people as they can, FEMA should follow a policy of “disaster equity” that sees minority communities being given the priority. “The shift that we're seeing right now is a shift in emergency management from utilitarian principles — where everything is designed for the greatest good, for the greatest amount of people — to disaster equity,” she said. These aren’t just suggestions; FEMA’s own website states that “Goal 1” is to “Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management.” It's hard to believe that an agency that is tasked with helping Americans in emergency situations is more concerned about helping those who make certain lifestyle choices than those who are dealing with devastating losses and deadly hurricane floodwaters. This should serve as a wakeup call to all white American men to make sure they are prepared for whatever natural disasters might come their way. Not only is FEMA running out of money, but they are the last group of people the agency would help anyway. Biden-Harris administration finds money for everyone except Americans Meanwhile, vice president and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has bragged on X that the U.S. is sending $157 million to help Lebanese people who are suffering from a war that the Biden-Harris administration is supporting. Her post states: ""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there."" It gets worse: “To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million.” She seems a lot more concerned about the “security and well being” of foreigners than Americans given the hundreds of millions of dollars they managed to find for the Lebanese people and illegal aliens while offering a measly $750 to hurricane victims in the U.S. We all know how far that is going to get them in the era of Bidenflation. The death toll from the hurricane stands at 227 people as of writing, with countless others still without electricity and dealing with crippling flooding in North Carolina. With another hurricane, Milton, having just made landfall in Florida last week as a Category 3 storm, those affected will have to help each other because it’s clear the government is not going to help them.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-13-hurricane-helene-toxic-industrial-sites-chemicals-water.html,Hurricane Helene swept through hundreds of toxic industrial sites – are all those chemicals now in the drinking water?,"Rice University researchers are calling for tighter restrictions on stored pollutants after it was discovered that Hurricane Helene ravaged hundreds of industrial sites in western North Carolina that were teeming with toxins and pollutants. Helene ripped apart paper mills, fertilizer factories, oil and gas storage facilities, and even a retired nuclear plant while drowning the region in water. That water likely became contaminated with all sorts of chemicals that are probably currently seeping into the ground and into drinking water supplies. While it is normally the case that rain and storm surge flooding from hurricanes results in some environmental contamination, i.e., from overflowing sewer systems, the situation with Helene is unique in the sheer volume of industrial facilities it affected. Nobody seems to have a clear idea as of yet about which bacteria, chemicals and other toxins are hiding in Helene's floodwaters or where they may have ended up in the days since the storm. All we know is that the pollution is voluminous. ""Hazardous releases remain largely invisible due to limited disclosure requirements and scant public information,"" the Rice researchers wrote in a paper. ""Even emergency responders often don't know exactly which hazardous chemicals they are facing in emergency situations."" Check out the video below of the wreckage left behind in downtown Marshall, N.C.

Mountain flooding from a hurricane is a whole new ballgame Western North Carolina is a largely rural area where many homeowners pull drinking water from wells rather than from municipal water supplies. As such, there is no telling whose wells became contaminated from Helene and whose did not, which is why the state's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is advising residents not to consume well water for the time being. Normally, hurricanes affect coastal areas the most, but in this case a highly mountainous region full of wells, rivers, lakes, and all sorts of other unique features bore the brunt of Helene, leaving experts in uncharted territory. ""We don't have a lot of knowledge about mountain flooding from a hydrology standpoint,"" said Kelsey Pieper, a professor of environmental engineering at Northeastern University . ""Water velocities tend to be higher in mountain floodings because it's getting funneled into the valley where the water is accumulating. In a coastal area, you're going to see more water spreading out. The flooding mechanisms are different and we know very little."" This is a big reason, by the way, why some government agencies are reluctant to allow volunteers to help with cleanup and rescue operations. Add to that the fact that the same government agencies are not bringing in the right equipment and you have a recipe for very little, if any, remediation being a success. ""We were supposed to get a big shipment of gloves, coveralls, masks, respirators, but we aren't,"" said local coordinating volunteer Rachel Bennett about the lack of supplies coming to the area. ""Those are big things because we're in cleanup right now. We need thick things."" The latest news about Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters can be found at Disaster.news . "

World-renowned experts like leading Japanese oncologist Dr. Masanori Fukushima are urging international prosecutors to try Gates in court, especially now that the government's Covid Task Force has uncovered plenty of damning evidence showing that the Microsoft co-founder is trying to mass-slaughter the global population. ""They warn that there is overwhelming evidence suggesting Gates isn't finished yet – he has plans to inflict even more harm in the near future,"" tweeted TPV Sean (@tpvsean), the X / Twitter account of The People's Voice .

Dr. Fukushima wants all COVID mRNA injections to be immediately pulled from the market After uncovering loads of scientific proof showing that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" are destroying lives, Dr. Fukushima issued a public plea for all of the mRNA (modRNA) varieties, i.e., Pfizer and Moderna, to be pulled from the market immediately. Dr. Fukushima called COVID jabs ""evil,"" adding that their impact on humanity has been nothing short of mass murder . And their release would not have been possible had the Trump administration not fast-tracked their release through Operation Warp Speed, the PREP Act and other tyrannical measures imposed during the ""pandemic.""

Will any of them ever face justice for their crimes against humanity? ""I've worked with the Japanese for years – I have an active project with them right now – and they have the highest integrity,"" said Dr. Peter McCullough of The Wellness Company to Alex Jones in a recent Infowars interview about the credibility of these claims out of Japan against Bill Gates. ""You know, they (Japanese scientists) did studies with the Olympics showing that routine PCR testing was completely bogus. They've returned millions of vials of Moderna and Pfizer because of visible contaminants. Now the Japanese are calling for all of the vaccines to be taken off the world markets."" The problem, of course, is that billions of people were already injected with these jabs, so taking them off the market now will accomplish nothing. Calling for it to happen, though, sends a message to the world that Japan knows the truth and wants everyone else to know it, too. The new Japanese government does not approve of what Dr. Fukushima is trying to do, and reports indicate that he and other scientists there are increasingly under attack for trying to send an important message to the world about the deadly impacts of COVID jabs. Despite widespread protests from both the scientific community and people in general, the new Japanese government is forging ahead with plans to unleash the world's first ""self-amplifying"" mRNA COVID jab, which could open up a whole new can of worms in terms of public health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-13-recall-meat-poultry-listeria-contamination.html,Recall issued for 9.9 million pounds of meat and poultry due to listeria contamination,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recalled nearly 10 million pounds of meat over listeria concerns. The Oklahoma-based food company BrucePac issued the recall after tests found that many of their products were positive for listeria monocytogenes. The items involved in the recall were produced between June and October of this year and shipped to distributors around the U.S. It is believed that more than 9.9 million pounds of ready-to-eat poultry and meat products have been contaminated. The USDA said in a press release: “The problem was discovered after USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) performed routine product testing of finished product containing RTE [ready-to-eat] poultry products produced by BrucePac and confirmed those products positive for Listeria monocytogenes.” Listeria infection is rare, but it can be deadly Food that is contaminated with the listeria monocytogenes bacteria can cause a listeria infection. The CDC reports that listeria is currently the third leading cause of death stemming from foodborne illness in the United States, with 1600 people being infected with the bacteria each year and 260 dying. Some of the symptoms of listeriosis include muscle aches, a stiff neck, confusion, convulsions, loss of balance, headache and fever. Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances are common, but the infection often extends beyond the GI tract and is particularly risky in the elderly, newborns and pregnant women. It can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, many shipments of meat and poultry that could have been contaminated have already been distributed to restaurants and institutions, who are being warned not to serve or use those bearing the affected batch numbers. Some of the recalled meats that were used to make ready-to-eat products could already be in some people’s refrigerators or freezers. There have not been any confirmed reports of adverse reactions among those who consumed the products, but it is important to keep in mind that some people who get sick from listeria will recover without ever being tested, and it may take several weeks to link a case to an outbreak. In addition, the symptoms of a listeria infection could take as many as 10 weeks to begin. Boar's Head deli meats also involved in listeria outbreak This outbreak comes on the heels of a similar outbreak connected to Boar's Head deli meat, which has caused 59 hospitalizations and 10 deaths since the CDC began an investigation into the matter in July. The outbreak sickened people in 19 states, and former workers have revealed highly unsanitary conditions in the plant. The Boar’s Head facility implicated in the outbreak was cited 69 times for noncompliance in the year leading up to the incident due to the presence of pools of blood on the floor, bugs, clogged drains and mold. A total of more than 7 million pounds of deli meat and cheese were recalled. The BrucePac meat isn’t the only food consumers need to watch out for; there is also an egg recall alert in effect that was issued by the CDC on September 6 before being upgraded to a Class 1 recall on September 30, designating it as a product that “will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.” The notice came after 65 individuals across 9 states became infected with salmonella linked to eggs, with 24 people requiring hospitalization as a result. The recalled eggs were distributed to retailers and food service distributors in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-13-trump-youngest-son-barron-rejected-by-bank.html,"CANCEL CULTURE: Trump’s youngest son Barron rejected by bank when he attempted to open a new account, Melania reveals in new memoir","Former President Donald Trump's youngest son, Barron, now 18 years old, was rejected when he attempted to open a new account at the family's preferred financial institution – a move the family claims is part of a larger ""cancel culture"" wave against the Trump family. Barron's mother, former First Lady Melania, said she believes her family is being targeted, raising significant concerns about potential civil rights violations. ""I was shocked and dismayed to learn that my long-time bank decided to terminate my account and deny my son the opportunity to open a new one,"" Melania wrote in her new memoir, ""Melania,"" published on Tuesday, Oct. 8. According to her, the said incident was an example of politically motivated bias. Despite the gravity of the accusations, she chose not to reveal the name of the financial institution involved. She further argued that this was a part of the broader culture of exclusion and suppression her family has endured, a backlash that intensified because of the Jan. 6 Capitol ""riot."" ""The 'cancel mob' now includes corporations, traditional media, influential social media figures, and cultural institutions,"" she added in the book, warning of the dangerous precedent this sets in modern society. She also highlighted how businesses, be they larger or smaller, join this ""disheartening trend."" The revelation about her son's bank account came after the former first lady told Fox News on Tuesday, Oct. 8, that Barron has been ""doing great"" since starting at New York University this fall. ""He loves his classes and his professors,"" Melania said. ""He's doing well, he's thriving and he's enjoying being in New York City again."" Donald and Melania's only son together is expected to commute from Trump Tower in Midtown to attend classes in Greenwich Village, the New York Post reported. (Related: Trump's youngest son declines to be RNC delegate due to prior commitments .) Debanking, the practice of denying individuals or organizations access to financial services based on their political, ideological or social positions, has emerged as a controversial trend within the broader phenomenon of cancel culture. ""It represents a significant escalation in the methods used to isolate or punish those whose views or actions fall outside mainstream acceptability, raising critical concerns about freedom of expression, civil rights and the role of private corporations in regulating societal behavior,"" Reclaim the Net explained. The practice is a potent tool because access to financial services is essential for participation in society, it added that without access to a bank account, credit or other financial tools, individuals and organizations can be effectively excluded from basic economic functions, making this tactic materially damaging. Barron being bullied online and in real life ""Barron's experience of being bullied both online and in real life is a clear indication of the irreparable damage caused,"" Melanie said of her son being tagged ""autistic"" by cyber bullies . While she made it clear that there is nothing shameful about autism, Melania said ""Barron is not autistic."" In her book, the former first lady said that his son was absolutely hurt by the rumors that had actually begun, thanks to Trump's former friend turned enemy celebrity Rosie O'Donnell. Back in 2016, O'Donnell posted a tweet that Barron was autistic without providing any evidence that he was at the time. The kid was only ten years old at the time and according to his mother, it took a lot of time to repair the damage to his self-confidence. She also accused O'Donnell of ""sheer malice."" ""I was appalled by such cruelty. It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism. I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn’t like my husband,"" Melania said. She continued: ""Someone had painstakingly compiled the footage and added captions like, 'His hands are moving erratically and aren't touching each other. Then he was spotted making strange movements in his seat, typical of children with autism.” O'Donnell eventually apologized for the social media post and said that it had nothing to do with her disdain for Barron's father.

The incident occurred on October 7 when Captain ?lçehin Pehlivan suffered a medical emergency mid-flight. On board crew tried to administer first aid but were unsuccessful as Pehlivan was pronounced dead before the flight could make its unscheduled emergency landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City around 6 a.m. the following day. After Pehlivan collapsed suddenly during the flight, the flight crew quickly diverted the Airbus 350 craft to the nearest available and suitable airport so he could receive treatment. Pehlivan passed before that could happen, but at least the flight landed safely, allowing passengers to get rerouted on another flight to Turkey. ""?lçehin Pehlivan, the captain of our Airbus 350 aircraft with TC-LGR tail registration, which was operating the flight number TK204 between Seattle and Istanbul, fainted during the flight,"" reported Turkish Airlines spokesman Yahya Üstün in an X / Twitter post. ""After the first medical evaluation to our captain on board was inconclusive, the cockpit crew ... decided to make an emergency landing, but our captain died before landing."" A pilot with Turkish Airlines since 2007, Pehlivan had previously passed a medical examination with flying colors.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-remdesivir-treatment-killed-service-members.html,Whistleblower: Remdesivir treatments have killed 601 service members,"More than 600 service members died after being treated with the controversial COVID-19 drug remdesivir at a time when it had not been approved by the FDA for treating the virus. This is according to documents from the Department of Defense Joint Trauma System that were released by a military whistleblower , and they note that the military gave the drug “liberally” to service members who were believed to have COVID-19 months ahead of its official FDA approval. The whistleblower, who uses the pseudonym Daniel LeMay to protect his identity, handed the documents over to journalist J.M. Phelps, and they were published in the Gateway Pundit . When the men discussed the contents of the documents, LeMay explained that the “initial trial depicted data manipulation in favor of remdesivir.” After analyzing the data, he determined that a number of the clinical trials did not use a genuine placebo group that was suitable for comparing to the results of those who received remdesivir. “The primary issue is with patient data. If we can’t verify the placebo group … then we can’t determine the actual efficacy of remdesivir,” he noted. The data shows that 941 military service members passed away from March 2020 to March 2024. 63.9% of them, which amounts to 601 individuals, were given remdesivir – even though the DoD should have been aware of the drug’s potential dangers at the time. Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola, but studies found that it was lethal in human patients. For example, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 noted that the drug caused the highest mortality rate of four potential Ebola therapies given to patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 53.1% of those who received it died. That didn't stop Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from awarding a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to “accelerate the development of a promising new drug (remdesivir) in the fight against deadly coronaviruses.” Then, in February 2020, Gilead was given FDA approval to carry out a series of Phase 3 clinical trials to determine the suitability of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. A month later, the DoD announced it was entering a “cooperative research and development agreement” that would allow them to gain access to the antiviral drug. Phelps pointed out that the FDA has the legal power “to authorize the emergency use of an otherwise unapproved medical product if the Department of Defense … determines that there is a military emergency involving an agent that may cause imminently life-threatening and specific risk to U.S. forces.” Multiple studies show drug is risky and ineffective The documents show that the studies involving the drug pointed to its many dangers. For example, one study published in the journal The Lancet in May 2020 showed that remdesivir was not very effective and that its use was stopped early in China because 12% of patients experienced adverse events. Furthermore, a study from 2021 published in the JAMA Network Open journal involving more than 2,300 veterans who were hospitalized with the virus found that treatment with the drug was “not associated with survival” and that the patients who were given the drug had longer hospital stays and more deaths than those who were not given it. Unfortunately, the documents also revealed that many service members were not told about the risks of the drug , which meant they could not provide informed consent. New Jersey state chair of FormerFedsGroup, Charlene Delfico, told The Defender : “The whistleblower highlights what we’ve been saying all along. This drug is dangerous, and in most cases, fatal. There’s been no transparency or oversight. This should enrage people and make them push for an immediate investigation by Congress.” "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-canada-passes-bill-free-contraception-abortion-pills.html,Canada passes controversial bill providing FREE contraception and abortion pills to all,"A Canadian bill that would allow ""free"" access to contraceptives, including abortifacients, has passed the Senate without any changes. In February, Canadian Minister of Health Mark Holland introduced Bill C-64 , known as ""An Act Respecting Pharmacare."" In February, Health Minister Mark Holland passed the Bill C-64 , also known as an ""Act respecting Pharmacare. The legislation, which passed its second reading in the Senate without any amendments on Oct. 3, seeks to provide universal, single-payer coverage to publicly-funded contraceptives and abortion pills to all Canadians. These contraception drugs and devices, includes oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormonal implants, injections and emergency contraception ""Cost can discourage people both from accessing contraception, and from choosing more effective methods of contraception with a higher upfront cost. For example, oral contraceptives have a typical use failure rate of nine percent compared to 0.20 percent for IUDs. Not having affordable access to effective contraception can increase the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can impact life plans such as going to school and advancing in one's career,"" Holland wrote about Bill C-64. The bill eventually received royal assent and became law on Thursday, Oct. 10 . ""Everyone in Canada deserves access to the care they need, including to prescription medications,"" Holland said, in response to the decision. ""Our plan for universal access to contraception means reproductive freedom and choice and access to diabetes medication is a transformational step towards improving health outcomes and health equity in Canada. I thank all partners for their contributions to making this happen."" (Related: REPORT: FDA used flawed studies, bad data to justify allowing abortion pills to be sent through the mail by pharmacists .) Bill C-64 faces backlash from various sectors Bill C-64 was heavily criticized by various sectors of Canadian society. In May, Campaign Life Coalition Director of Communications Pete Baklinski accused the government of promoting a ""big lie"" that women cannot control their fertility without contraceptives. ""There's a BIG LIE behind the Trudeau Liberal's free contraception pharmacare plan. PM Trudeau believes that women won't have 'control' over their bodies until they're popping man-made pills every day to suppress their God-given fertility,"" Baklinski wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""But women don't need a daily dose of synthetic, cancer-causing hormones to have control over their lives. God has already built into the woman's body an amazing natural cycle of fertility."" Canadian Chamber of Commerce echoed this statement when it passed the Senate and warned that the bill could impact private insurance coverage. ""The legislation itself, which is only two pages long, raises more questions than answers,"" said Kathy Megyery, who serves as the senior vice president and general manager of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Quebec. ""And this is only the first step of national pharmacare, which will eventually be expanded to cover all categories of drugs. With the valued workplace insurance of 27 million Canadians at risk, not to mention the risk of federal creep into provincial areas, we cannot accept this level of ambiguity from policymakers.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-onions-natures-often-overlooked-superfood.html,Onions: Nature’s often overlooked superfood,"Onions, scientifically known as Allium cepa , are more than just a kitchen staple. They have been used for centuries across various cultures, not only for their rich flavor but also for their medicinal properties. Recent studies, including one published in the Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ECAM) journal, highlight that onions are packed with bioactive compounds – natural chemicals that provide a range of health benefits. The benefits of onions begin with their remarkable nutrient profile. Although they are often overlooked in favor of more glamorous superfoods, onions quietly deliver a wide range of essential nutrients in every bite . A medium-sized raw onion (about 148 grams) provides just 45 calories, with no fat or cholesterol. While low in calories, onions are packed with essential vitamins, minerals and fiber – all of which play a key role in promoting overall health. Science-backed health benefits of onions Onions are packed with an impressive array of phytochemicals , natural compounds produced by plants with numerous health benefits. They contain organosulfur compounds, phenolic compounds (which include flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids and tannins), polysaccharides and saponins. Studies have shown that onions promote better health in many ways. Bone density Regularly eating onions may offer significant benefits for bone health, particularly for women going through or having completed menopause. A 2009 study published in Menopause found that women who consumed onions frequently had a 20 percent lower risk of experiencing hip fractures compared to those who never included onions in their diet. This suggests that onions can play a protective role in maintaining bone density when women are particularly susceptible to bone loss. Furthermore, onions have been shown to help combat osteoporosis , a chronic condition that decreases bone mineral density. Research published in Food Frontiers in 2020 highlights the potential of onions to support bone health by addressing the inflammatory processes associated with this condition. Cancer A study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food found a strong link between Allium vegetable consumption and a lower incidence of this type of cancer. One of the key players in onions is quercetin, which is considered a powerful anticancer agent . According to experts at the University of Maryland Medical Center , quercetin may inhibit cancer cells in various types of tumors, including those found in the breast, colon, endometrium, lungs, ovaries and prostate. The National Onion Association highlights a recent study from the Netherlands, which found that people who consumed onions absorbed twice as much quercetin as those who drank tea and over three times more than those who ate apples, which are also high in quercetin. Among the different varieties, red onions stand out as particularly rich in quercetin, while shallots and yellow onions are also good options. In contrast, white onions have the least amount of quercetin and other antioxidants. A study published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology revealed that consuming Allium vegetables is linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Researchers studied more than 800 participants and discovered that those who had higher quantities of Allium vegetables had an almost 80 percent lower chance of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who consumed fewer. Onions may also offer benefits for individuals undergoing cancer treatment. Research published in Integrative Cancer Therapies found that eating yellow onions helped reduce insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Digestion Onions promote bowel movement regularity and overall good digestion, thanks to their fiber content. One special type of soluble fiber found in onions is called oligofructose, which helps nourish the good bacteria in your intestines. A study published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology suggests that oligofructose can help prevent and treat certain types of diarrhea – making onions a beneficial addition to your diet when digestive issues arise. Additionally, phytochemicals in onions which help neutralize harmful free radicals, may also lower your risk of developing gastric ulcers, according to the National Onion Association. Eye health Onions may also have potential benefits for eye health, particularly in combating age-related changes to the cornea. A 2021 study in Anatomy & Cell Biology explored how fresh onion juice could help address structural and functional changes in the cornea , which are common as we age. The study conducted on rats revealed that applying diluted onion juice as eye drops over 12 weeks led to several improvements in the aged rats. These included lower intraocular pressure, increased tear production and the restoration of key layers of the cornea that had deteriorated due to aging. The researchers suggested that these benefits could be due to the antioxidant properties of onion juice, which may help protect eye tissues from damage. They also found that onion juice triggered the activation of key proteins, like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and paired box protein-6 (PAX6), which are crucial for corneal health. This suggests that onions could help maintain healthy eyes as we age by promoting tissue repair and reducing oxidative stress. Additionally, a 2014 study in Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology found that onion juice may have antimicrobial properties that could inhibit the growth of certain bacteria on the surfaces of the eye. While this effect needs more research, it points to the potential of onion juice to help common eye infections, like blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) and conjunctivitis (also known as ""pink eye,"" an infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye, often causing irritation and redness). Heart health Research published in Thrombosis Research in 2002 shows that sulfur compounds in onions act as natural blood thinners . This means they help prevent blood platelets from sticking together, When platelets clump, it can lead to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. This finding is supported by a similar 1992 study in the same journal that looked at the heart benefits of sulfur in garlic . In addition, a 1987 study in the Journal of Hypertension found that sulfur intake could help delay or reduce high blood pressure in animals. While more research is needed to see if this benefit applies to humans, it highlights the potential of sulfur in heart health. Recent studies have also revealed that oxylipins, which are molecules that help regulate various bodily functions, can play a role in managing cholesterol levels. According to findings in a 2017 study in Redox Biology , eating onions increases oxylipins , which help maintain healthy blood fat and cholesterol levels. The flavonoid quercetin found in onions is another key player in promoting heart health, It helps prevent plaque buildup in the arteries caused by high cholesterol, which lowers the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A notable study in 2018 published in the Pharmacy & Pharmacology International Journal explored how onions can lower cholesterol . Researchers had participants eat 200 grams of onions daily for two months – divided across breakfast, lunch and dinner. The results were promising – 35 out of 40 participants saw significant reductions in their total cholesterol levels. The authors concluded that onions, along with ginger, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) by lowering both total cholesterol and LDL ""bad"" cholesterol. Blood sugar One of the key components in onions is chromium, a mineral that assists in maintaining balanced blood sugar levels. Additionally, the sulfur in onions boosts insulin production, which is crucial for lowering blood sugar. Research published in Environmental Health Insights in 2010 found that people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who consumed red onions experienced lower glucose levels for up to four hours after eating. This indicates that including onions in meals can be beneficial for managing blood sugar spikes. Another study published in Nutrition in 2014 found that people with Type 2 diabetes saw improvements in their liver enzyme levels and lower glycemic levels when they included sliced onions in their diet. This highlights the potential of onions as a valuable ally in blood sugar regulation. Watch this video about the best onion to use .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-toxic-heavy-metals-pesticides-detected-school-lunches.html,Dumbing them down: Toxic heavy metals and pesticides found in children’s school lunches,"Testing carried out by ABC News has revealed that the school lunches served to children in Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland contain shocking amounts of toxic heavy metals such as lead, along with dozens of pesticides. The testing was carried out by the accredited independent lab The Health Research Institute, whose chief scientist and CEO, John Fagan, called the findings “pretty shocking.” Some of the foods tested by the lab included potatoes, fruit, pizza and breadsticks. The presence of heavy metals in children's food is highly concerning as exposure can lead to irreversible damage. One of the most dangerous heavy metals is lead , and it was found in 100 percent of the samples. Lead at any level is known to cause reduced IQ and behavioral and attention issues in children. It can also damage the brain and central nervous system. Some of the food samples tested also contained the heavy metal cadmium , with levels at more than 12 times the limit established by the FDA for bottled water. This metal can increase the risk of lung cancer. Another heavy metal, arsenic, was found in rice at six times the permissible level for foods like apple juice. A total of 49 pesticides were identified across the school lunches tested, and one single elementary school lunch contained 38 different pesticides. In just one cup of strawberries, 23 pesticides were found. Fungicides and pesticides found in children's meals Some of the dangerous chemicals that were found included carbendazim. This fungicide has already been outlawed in many European countries, along with places like Australia and Brazil, due to its ability to cause endocrine disruption and infertility. Not surprisingly, many of the wheat-based items that were served to school children contained the weedkiller glyphosate, which is the subject of numerous lawsuits related to cancer and is also known for disrupting immune function and other health effects. They also found other toxic weedkillers, such as Dicamba and 2,4D. Children are especially vulnerable ABC News reached out George Mason University School of Public Health Dean Dr. Melissa Perry to analyze the results. The pesticide expert blamed regulators for the situation, stating: “50 pesticides in school lunches, it’s not okay. It demonstrates that our regulatory system is not succeeding in ensuring that the food that children eat are free from chemical burden.” Dr. Perry pointed out that even when foods do fall within the limits on pesticide residues established by regulators, that does not mean they are safe. Some limits are outdated, and children are especially vulnerable to their effects given the fact that their brains and bodies are still developing. She added: “The variety and the volume of chemicals that are being introduced in the market every year makes it practically impossible to evaluate the health effects of each and every chemical. We don’t know what it means to be exposed over time at low levels continuously, especially for developing children.” Another big unknown is what can happen when children are exposed to multiple pesticides at once, as is the case with those who are consuming the school lunches tested and those at many other schools throughout the nation. Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) recently introduced the Safe School Meals Act, whose goal is to keep toxins out of the nation’s school lunches. It would introduce limits on the heavy metals found in foods, along with reassessing food additives for safety and banning food containing certain pesticide residues . It also takes aim at the packaging of school meals, banning PFAS, bisphenols and phthalates to protect children’s health. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-covid-vaccines-increased-risk-myocarditis-in-children.html,"Pfizer, CDC withheld evidence that COVID-19 vaccines increased the risk of myocarditis in children","Pfizer and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) withheld evidence that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines increased the risk of myocarditis in children , according to two sets of documents made public. Confidential Pfizer documents leaked by Project Veritas show that Big Pharma had ""evidence that suggests patients who received a (COVID-19) vaccine are at an increased risk of myocarditis."" (Related: Fatality rate spikes to 9.6% for individuals diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis after taking the COVID vaccine .) Meanwhile, heavily redacted CDC documents obtained by the Children's Health Defense (CHD) via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that the agency provided an undercounted figure of post-COVID-19 vaccination myocarditis cases to Israel's Ministry of Health in early 2021. The latest revelations come as Germany, Japan and other governments are raising questions about the significant numbers of severe adverse events recorded in individuals following the administration of the vaccines. ""This study clearly shows that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine provides almost no benefit to children and adolescents, but does increase their risk of myocarditis and pericarditis,"" said Dr. Brian Hooker, CHD's chief scientific officer. ""It begs the question: Why does the CDC continue to recommend these unlicensed shots for kids? Where is the data they use to support their statement that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh the risks?"" The Pfizer vaccine provided children and teens in England with only about 14 to 15 weeks of protection against the virus, as per a preprint study of over 1.7 million children ages five to 15. Moreover, researchers investigating the safety and effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine in fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated children and teens, also found cases of myocarditis and pericarditis only in vaccinated children. The study found that vaccinated children required slightly fewer emergency room visits and hospital stays, but that those outcomes were extremely rare in children and teens across all groups. COVID-19 vaccine provides almost no benefit to children, study reveals Public health agencies in the United Kingdom and the U.S. granted authorization to the Pfizer vaccines based on clinical trials that measured immunogenicity and efficacy against infection. Their research confirmed that even in 2021, when the vaccine was first authorized for children and teens, that age group did not face a high risk for COVID-19-related serious outcomes, including death or the need for emergency care, hospitalization or critical care. The researchers tested the effectiveness of the first vaccine dose versus no vaccine and of two doses versus a single dose. They matched each vaccinated child with an unvaccinated one, and participants were matched by age, sex, region, prior COVID-19 testing and childhood vaccination status. Of the 1,262,784 children in the adolescent part of the study, vaccinated and unvaccinated, there were only 72 emergency room visits, 90 COVID-19 hospitalizations and no deaths. There were nine cases of pericarditis and three cases of myocarditis, all in the vaccinated group. Among all of the children in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated group, there were no emergency visits, only six hospitalizations and no deaths related to COVID-19. There were three cases of pericarditis, all in vaccinated children. The researchers concluded that in adolescents, the vaccine reduced the rate of hospitalization more than it increased the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis, but for children, the increased risk of pericarditis was higher than the reduction of risk for hospitalization.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-healing-and-culinary-legacy-of-onions.html,Healing and culinary legacy of ONIONS,"Onions have an ancient and fascinating history , with origins tracing back to Central Asia, Iran and West Pakistan. Cultivated for over 5,000 years , onions were likely a staple in prehistoric diets long before the advent of agriculture or written records. Their long shelf life and adaptability made them an essential food source, capable of thriving in diverse climates and soils. In ancient Egypt, onions were more than just a dietary staple – they held deep spiritual meaning. Onions were often buried with pharaohs and depicted in tombs, with many mummies discovered entombed with onions placed strategically. This suggests that they were believed to possess magical or protective qualities, perhaps to aid in the afterlife. Onions also make appearances in biblical texts, highlighting their significance in the diets of the Israelites during the Exodus. Ancient Indian texts praise onions for their medicinal properties, while the Greeks and Romans valued them for both culinary and therapeutic purposes – using them to strengthen athletes and treat various ailments. Healing legacy of onions Onion contains chemicals that helps reduce swelling and lung tightness related to asthma. It also contains chemicals that helps reduce cholesterol and lower blood sugar . People use onion to prevent scarring. It is also used for hair loss, insomnia and high blood pressure. Egypt In ancient Egypt, onions held a revered position – not just as a dietary staple but for their deep symbolic and medicinal importance. Their layered structure symbolized ""eternity,"" representing the cycle of life, which is why onions featured prominently in religious rituals and funerals. According to Ebers Papyrus , a 110-page document dating back to 3000 BC and often called an ancient medical encyclopedia because it contains remedies for thousands of ailments, onions were used to treat a wide variety of health problems, including breathing difficulties (like asthma), colds, coughs, digestive issues like constipation, dog bites, eye disorders, headaches, heart problems, insect stings, joint pain and skin conditions. Onions were also used as anti-inflammatory medicine to improve blood circulation; as an antiseptic to clean wounds; and as a diuretic to help the body get rid of excess fluid. Onions were believed to help with congestion, induce sweating and even fight bacteria . The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus contains onion-based remedies for toothaches, showing that onions were also part of early Egyptian dental care. Another example, the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus, which dates back to 1825 BC, describes how Egyptians used onions to test for fertility and pregnancy. Besides these practical medicinal uses, onions were also thought to have marginal powers. Egyptians believed that onions could absorb bad energy and germs and they would tie the onions around their necks to prevent colds. Greece and Rome In both ancient Greece and Rome, onions were celebrated not only for their culinary value but also for their medicinal properties. Greek athletes believed that consuming large quantities of onions could enhance their endurance and strength, often using them as a natural performance booster before competitions. Additionally, onions were frequently prepared as syrups or mixed with honey to treat colds and coughs. The Roman scholar Pliny the Elder documented various healing applications of onions, noting their effectiveness in treating ailments ranging from insect bites and wounds to headaches and body aches. Onions were commonly used in poultices or consumed as juices to harness their healing benefits. India In India, onions have been a fundamental component of both cuisine and traditional medicine for centuries. The ancient medical text Charaka Samhita , dating back to the 6th century BC, highlights a variety of medicinal uses for onions. Their anti-inflammatory properties make onions effective in treating conditions like arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Additionally, they were revered as blood purifiers and featured in various remedies to cleanse the body. Onions were also consumed to support digestive health – believed to stimulate appetite and/or alleviate bloating or gas after heavy, rich meals. Whether raw in salads, cooked in dishes, or processed into juices and syrups, onions have remained a versatile element in Indian healing practices. Medieval Europe In Medieval Europe, herbalists and healers crafted various onion-based recipes to treat ailments like fevers, headaches and respiratory issues. Onions were frequently included in poultices for wound care. They were commonly consumed in soups and broths or transformed into ointments and syrups to harness their medicinal properties. Native American medicine Various Native American tribes recognized the healing potential of onions , integrating them into traditional remedies. Onions were used to alleviate digestive issues and were often incorporated into meals to support gastrointestinal health. Additionally, crushed onions were applied to wounds to help prevent infection and promote healing. Native Americans sometimes brew onions into medicinal teas or use them as poultices for various ailments. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), onions, known as ""cong,"" are valued for their warming properties. They are commonly used to treat colds and flu , usually by boiling them in water and drinking the resulting liquid to relieve congestion and cough. Onions also feature prominently in meals aimed at stimulating digestion and enhancing gastrointestinal health. While often cooked in dishes, onions are also consumed in broths or blended with other herbs for medicinal purposes. Culinary legacy of onions Onions taste great and look great, making them a perfect topper for entrees like chili, hot dogs and red meat. Their versatility allows them to add flavor and texture to soups, salsas, curries and sauces.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-10-japan-introduce-self-amplifying-mrna-covid-vaccine.html,"Japan to introduce self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with a 90% adverse event rate, and the U.S. is next in line","Pharmaceutical companies are exploiting populations year-after-year, fine tuning the name of illnesses annually and marketing new cures that only make people sicker. Beginning this fall, Japan will introduce a self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as part of its vaccination program for the 2024-2025 fall and winter seasons. The vaccine, Kostaive (ARCT-154), will be available for 7,000 yen ($47) to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as those aged 60 to 64 with severe underlying health conditions. It is part of a two-dose series. In clinical trials, a near 90 percent adverse event rate was recorded after the first dose. These adverse events were disregarded, however, as Japan approved the jab. The United States is also looking to approve these jabs in the coming years. World’s first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be released in Japan ARCT-154 became the world’s first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines — which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists — saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This ""biological printing press"" could theoretically amplify the vaccine’s presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, “These products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.” In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. “We simply do not know what the consequences could be,” she warned. “There have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects — for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] — of self-amplifying mRNA injections,” she said. “We simply do not know what the consequences could be.” Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to “conventional mRNA injections on steroids,” as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal government’s Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply “conduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bio’s partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions , so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-10-anise-health-benefits-you-should-know-about.html,Anise: The ancient spice with surprising health benefits you should know about,"Anise ( Pimpinella anisum L. ) has been used for thousands of years to flavor food and treat health problems, including coughs and digestive issues. What makes anise so special is its unique flavor, which you may recognize from foods like herbal teas and licorice, and its powerful medicinal properties that modern science is beginning to record and understand. With its warm, licorice-like flavor, anise has a long, rich history that began in the ancient world . In ancient Egypt, anise was cherished not only as a cooking spice but also as a remedy for a variety of ailments. The Egyptians used anise to ease digestion, help with fluid retention and relieve toothaches. The Greeks furthered the tradition, with well-known healers like Dioscorides and Hippocrates highlighting anise's medical benefits. Dioscorides praised the herb for calming headaches, relieving digestive issues and even encouraging better sleep. Hippocrates, on the other hand, saw anise as a remedy for respiratory issues – helping clear congestion and soothing excessive sneezing and coughing. The Romans embraced anise with equal enthusiasm. Pliny the Elder, a Roman naturalist, recorded many of the Greek uses of anise, including its effectiveness for easing digestive troubles and clearing the chest. Medicinal properties and health benefits of anise Anise is rich in nutrients and natural compounds that make it both flavorful and beneficial to health . The seeds of anise have about nine to 12 percent moisture, 18 percent protein and varying amounts of fatty oils and fiber, along with a range of B-complex vitamins – thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3) and pyridoxine (B6) – which are crucial for energy, healthy cells and metabolism. Anise is also a good source of choline, a compound often grouped with B vitamins due to its similar health benefits, supporting brain health and cellular function. In addition to vitamins A and C, anise is rich in essential minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese and zinc, which are vital for healthy bones, blood and overall cellular health. Anise's real magic lies in its unique blend of volatile (1.5 to 3.5 percent) and fixed oils (eight to 23 percent) in the seeds. These oils are packed with bioactive compounds like anethole, methyl chavicol and various terpenes. Anethole is the main component, making up 70 to 90 percent of anise's essential oils, and is responsible for its distinctive flavor. Anise eases digestive discomfort Anise has carminative properties , which help to ease bloating, gas and indigestion . It works by relaxing the muscles in the digestive tract, which makes it easier for trapped air to pass – relieving discomfort. Anise relieves coughs and clears respiratory tract Persistent coughs and respiratory discomfort can be draining. Anise has been traditionally used for these symptoms and modern science shows it works as an expectorant . This means it helps to loosen mucus – making it easier to clear out of the respiratory system. The main compound responsible for this is (E)-anethole, which supports breathing by allowing trapped mucus to be expelled – soothing coughs and easing congestion. (Related: Herbs and honey: 7 Natural home remedies for a cough .) Anise eases menstrual discomfort Anise has long been used to relieve menstrual cramps and recent studies confirm its effectiveness. The phytoestrogens in anise, such as anethole, can help balance hormones, which is especially helpful for managing menstrual irregularities and pain. Anise boosts breast milk production In some cultures, anise is used to boost milk production for nursing mothers. This property, called "" galactagogue ,"" is likely due to the phytoestrogen compounds in anise that mimic estrogen and support milk flow. While still under research in the West, anise shows promise as a natural way to support lactation. Anise fights bacterial and fungal infections Research has shown that the essential oils in anise have strong antibacterial and antifungal properties , which can help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi. This makes anise a potential natural ally in fighting infections, especially for those looking for alternative treatments. Discover more health benefits and uses of herbs at Herbs.news .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-10-turmeric-golden-spice-stood-test-of-time.html,Turmeric: How the golden spice stood the test of time,"Turmeric, often called the ""golden spice,"" has been revered for centuries as more than just a vibrant yellow seasoning. In ancient Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, it was cherished for its healing properties. The bright yellow powder, made from the rhizome (the thick underground stem that grows horizontally and produces roots and shoots from its nodes) of the Curcuma longa plant, has played a pivotal role in traditional medicine for over 4,000 years. In many South Asian countries, it is applied as a topical antiseptic for bruises, burns and cuts and is known for its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. In Pakistan, it is used to treat gastrointestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome, while in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, it is applied to wounds to promote healing. Indian practices also use turmeric for blood purification and skincare, with turmeric paste applied to brides and grooms before marriage to enhance skin glow and ward off bacteria. Today, turmeric continues to play a role in modern skincare, with multinational companies incorporating it into face creams and sunscreens. In Ayurvedic medicine, turmeric is prescribed for respiratory issues, like allergies and asthma, as well as liver problems, rheumatism and sinusitis. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used to treat abdominal pain, while both Ayurveda and Chinese medicine recognize it as a digestive aid that reduces bloating and gas. Unani medicine uses turmeric to clear phlegm, enhance fat digestion by stimulating bile production and improve circulation. Turmeric is also consumed with milk or water to alleviate colds, digestive disorders and sore throats. Historically, turmeric's role went far beyond the kitchen – forming an essential part of health rituals across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It was believed to balance the body's energy, heal wounds, purify the blood and more. Turmeric's ancient reputation is now supported by modern science. Researchers have identified curcumin – a powerful bioactive compound in turmeric – as the key behind its therapeutic effects. Curcumin is known for its strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and numerous studies have explored its impact on chronic diseases like arthritis, heart disease and even cancer. A 2021 study published in Drug Design, Development and Therapy found that curcumin could help reduce inflammation at the molecular level by acting on pathways that are critical in the development of chronic diseases . Similarly, research highlighted in Antioxidants showed how curcumin can neutralize harmful free radicals , potentially slowing down cellular aging and promoting overall health. This journey from ancient folklore to scientific credibility underscores turmeric's enduring medicinal value. Turmeric's active compounds Turmeric's impressive health benefits are attributed to more than 100 bioactive compounds – each contributing to its diverse medicinal properties. While the most well-known compound is curcumin, the root of turmeric holds a wealth of other powerful substances that play key roles in promoting health and wellness. Curcuminoids: Nature's antioxidants Curcuminoids, a group of compounds responsible for turmeric's bright yellow hue, are at the forefront of its medicinal power. Curcumin, the most studied curcuminoid, is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, curcumin is not alone – demethoxycurcumin, 5-methoxycurcumin and dihydrocurcumin also belong to this group. Together, these curcuminoids act as natural antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals in the body. By reducing oxidative stress, they protect cells from damage and slow down the aging process. This antioxidant action makes curcumin particularly effective in fighting chronic diseases linked to inflammation, such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease and even some cancers. Studies have shown that curcumin can inhibit molecules such as NF-kB, which play a role in driving inflammation in the body. Turmeric's essential oils support brain health Turmeric's essential oils, particularly arturmerone, turmerone and zingiberene, give the spice its distinctive aroma. But these oils do more than add flavor – they've been shown by science to have neuroprotective properties. Aromatic turmerone, in particular, has been studied for its potential to stimulate the production of new neurons in the brain – a process called neurogenesis. This means turmeric could support brain health and potentially offer protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Other volatile oils, such as alpha-phellandrene, borneol, sabinene and zingiberene possess antimicrobial properties, further enhancing turmeric's medicinal value. These compounds may help prevent infections and promote overall immune health. Sesquiterpenes: Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agents Turmeric also contains a variety of sesquiterpenes – compounds that contribute to its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and analgesic effects. Some of the key sesquiterpenes found in turmeric include alpha- and beta-turmerones, curcumenone, germacrone and zingiberene. These sesquiterpenes are crucial in reducing inflammation, which is often the root cause of pain in conditions, like arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Additionally, sesquiterpenes are known to possess antibacterial and antifungal properties – making turmeric useful in traditional medicine for healing wounds, treating infections and maintaining overall immune health. These compounds are often unique to specific species of turmeric, which explains why different varieties of turmeric may have slightly varying medicinal properties. Polysaccharides: Immune boosters Recently, researchers have identified four new polysaccharides in turmeric called ukonans, that further enhance the spice's immune-boosting effects . Polysaccharides are long chains of carbohydrates that have been shown to stimulate the immune system. These compounds may help the body fight off infections and improve overall health by enhancing the body's natural defense mechanisms. Other nutrients in turmeric Turmeric isn't just a treasure trove of medicinal compounds – it is also packed with essential nutrients. A typical serving of turmeric is rich in dietary fiber, iron, potassium and vitamins like niacin (B3) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). These nutrients help support various bodily functions, including blood circulation digestion and immune health. Furthermore, turmeric contains omega-3 fatty acids and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which are beneficial for health. Omega-3s help reduce inflammation in the body and can lower the risk of heart disease by improving cholesterol levels and supporting overall cardiovascular functions. How these compounds work together The combined action of these compounds makes turmeric a potent multi-tasker in health and wellness. Curcuminoids work on a cellular level to combat oxidative stress, while turmerone and other volatile oils support brain function and offer antimicrobial benefits. Sesquiterpenes provide anti-inflammatory effects, reducing pain and promoting healing. Meanwhile, polysaccharides help bolster the immune system, offering protection from illness. Each compound contributes uniquely to turmeric's therapeutic properties, creating a powerful synergistic effect that can target multiple areas of health – from digestion and immunity to brain health and chronic inflammation.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-is-it-time-nationwide-ban-fluoridated-water.html,Is it time for a nationwide ban on fluoridated water?,"Do community leaders reserve the right to mass medicate every person in their community using the water supply as a vector? What if that medicine was eventually exposed as a POISON decades later ? What if that POISON was damaging the brains of children and stunting the cognitive development of the next generation? Since 1945, municipal water supplies have been mass medicated (poisoned) by hydrofluorosilicic acid (fluoride) . A byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry, fluoride is captured by industrial scrubbers, and then barreled up and sold unrefined to communities across the country. Today, around 72.7% of U.S. communities are subject to this toxic chemical. But with new evidence coming out against fluoride, is it time for a nationwide ban on fluoridated water? EPA must take regulatory action against fluoridated water, so why not just ban it? In a landmark decision, a federal court recently ruled that water fluoridation at the current levels poses an “unreasonable risk” to children , markedly reducing IQ and harming their cognitive development. The ruling, issued on September 24, requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take regulatory action in response to the lawsuit filed by the Fluoride Action Network and several other organizations. Back in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced plans to lower the recommended fluoride level in drinking water, citing a rise in dental fluorosis cases among children. This condition, caused by excessive fluoride exposure, prompted federal agencies to put limits on fluoride levels in water. In 2015, federal guidelines were finally revised , establishing 0.7 parts per million (ppm) as the standard fluoride level for community water systems. However, according to The National Toxicology Program , even this level of .7 ppm causes health problems in children, harming their cognitive development and lowering their IQ in a dose dependent manner. So why regulate this chemical at all, if the most scientifically-appropriate public health measure is a complete ban on fluoride? Former fluoride advocate now speaks out against the poison Rick North, a former advocate for fluoridation shared his transformative experience after reviewing a 2006 report by the National Academy of Sciences. “I always thought fluoridation was fine,” North said, reflecting on his past beliefs. “But the science contradicted the statements from fluoridation promoters.” Since that turning point, North has dedicated himself to opposing fluoridation, serving as a board member of the Fluoride Action Network. The lawsuit, initiated in 2017, faced numerous delays, as the EPA tried to postpone proceedings to protect the reputations of those who had promoted fluoride for decades. A key moment in the case came with the release of a report from the National Toxicology Program, which indicated a link between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children. This report played a crucial role in the judge’s decision, as North noted, “The evidence was compelling.” However, North pointed out that economic interests and professional reputations have played a significant role in the continuation of this practice. The EPA currently has 60 days to respond to the court ruling, but the implications of this decision may resonate far beyond that timeline. As communities weigh the risks associated with fluoridation, the conversation around public health, scientific evidence and regulatory oversight is likely to intensify in the coming months and years. Following the ruling, communities across the U.S. have begun to reevaluate their fluoridation practices. Cities such as Abilene, Texas, and Yorktown, New York, have paused or stopped fluoridation, a move that highlights local autonomy in public health decisions. North emphasized that many communities do not need to wait for the EPA's response, stating, “It’s their decision to fluoridate or not.” While this is true, citizens across the United States should not have to wait for their community officials to weigh the evidence and consider their reputations. If making America healthy again is going to be a serious political movement, then water purity should be top priority. Political leaders should be informing the public that they are being poisoned by fluoride, while petitioning Congress to ban water fluoridation across the United States to protect the welfare of the people.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-hurricane-helene-shuts-iv-fluid-manufacturer-baxter.html,IV fluid shortage hits hospitals after Hurricane Helene shuts top manufacturer,"Hospitals across the U.S. are taking steps to conserve their supplies of IV fluids after Hurricane Helene struck a critical manufacturing plant belonging to the country's biggest supplier. Baxter International, a medical technology company responsible for making IV fluids for most U.S. hospitals, said that it would temporarily close production at its North Cove, North Carolina facility because of flooding from Helene, raising concerns about a potential nationwide shortage. (Related: Scenic NC town wiped out by Hurricane Helene as state’s death toll continues to climb .) IV fluids deliver drugs or water with electrolytes directly into a patient's bloodstream. They're also critical for surgery, when a person cannot eat or drink, to keep them hydrated. Baxter also makes specialty fluids, such as peritoneal dialysis fluid, which helps patients with kidney failure filter waste from their blood, and irrigation fluids, used during procedures to clean or flush wounds. ""These are not high-dollar, lucrative products, but they are the warhorse products in a hospital,"" said Soumi Saha, senior vice president of government affairs at Premier, a group purchasing organization for hospital supplies that serves thousands of medical institutions in the United States. ""You go in for anything and the first thing that they're doing is hanging an IV bag."" Mass General Brigham, a prestigious hospital system, said it is continuing to treat patients normally, but is conserving its fluid supplies . This includes switching to oral hydration for patients who are healthy enough for it, and not discarding partially used IV fluid bags when patients are moved to a different part of the hospital. ""Right now we are continuing all of our clinical care as we normally do,"" said Dr. Paul Biddinger, chief preparedness and continuity officer at Mass General Brigham. ""We intend to preserve clinical care in the face of this shortage as long as we possibly can."" FDA recertification of Baxter may take time Baxter said a levee breach contributed to the flooding, and bridges leading to the plant were also damaged. The company said it is working with health, emergency and other government agencies to assess the damage to the plant and come up with a plan to restart production as quickly as possible. Ahead of the storm, the company evacuated workers and moved products to higher ground or secure storage where possible. The company has been allocating products to customers to try to conserve supply and ensure equitable distribution. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it is working with Baxter and could expedite its review of manufacturing lines at the plant when they are cleaned and restored. The agency also said it would work with other Baxter locations, and other suppliers, to increase supplies of the solutions. The duration of the shortages could depend on how extensively damaged the plant is. If the flooding affects the plant's ability to meet FDA standards for sterility and stability, it typically takes 90 days to receive FDA recertification. Visit Disaster.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-powerful-healing-properties-of-sandalwood-essential-oil.html,Powerful healing properties of sandalwood essential oil,"Famous for its distinctive soothing scent, sandalwood essential oil is used as a key ingredient in many products around the world. Sandalwood essential oil is extracted from sandalwood trees typically between 40 and 80 years old through a process called steam distillation. Older trees produce richer oil with a stronger fragrance, with ""royal trees"" that are closer to 80 years old, known to produce the purest and best quality essential oil. While Indian sandalwood ( Santalum album ) is considered the highest quality, it is becoming rare and insanely expensive due to over-harvesting. Other types include the equally expensive Hawaiian sandalwood ( S. ellipticum ), and Australian sandalwood ( S. spicatum ). While Australian sandalwood is commercially used, it is not as highly regarded for its benefits. The main components that give sandalwood oil its unique properties are alpha- and beta-santalol, santalenes and santyl acetate. Here are some of the benefits that come with sandalwood essential oil , the ""liquid gold"" from royal trees. Anti-inflammatory Sandalwood oil has anti-inflammatory properties – meaning it helps reduce irritation and swelling. A 2019 study published in the Indian Dermatology Outline Journal found that one if its main components, alpha-santalol, can reduce inflammation by influencing certain proteins in your body, known as cytokines and chemokines. Both alpha- and beta-santalol are also known to block a key inflammatory pathway, which helps lower levels of inflammation-related substances, like prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2. Because of these effects, sandalwood oil shows promise in treating skin conditions, like atopic dermatitis or eczema (a common skin condition that makes the skin dry, red and itchy, often triggered by allergens and irritants) and psoriasis (a skin condition that causes red, scaly, itchy, painful and uncomfortable patches to form on the skin). Antioxidant and antiaging Recent research in Cosmetics has uncovered a new benefit of Indian sandalwood oil – it may help protect the skin from harmful environmental stressors . In laboratory tests, the oil was found to significantly reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are damaging molecules produced by environmental factors, like blue light and pollution. Specifically, it protected skin cells (HaCaT cells) from oxidative stress caused by blue light and cigarette smoke. Further experiments using human skin samples showed that Indian sandalwood oil also reduced the harmful effects of pollutants, like cigarette smoke and ozone by lowering the levels of MMP-1, an enzyme that breaks down skin collagen and contributes to aging. These findings suggest that Indian sandalwood oil has the potential to be used not only for its fragrance and aromatherapy benefits but also as a protective ingredient in skincare products. With further research, it could become a valuable multipurpose ingredient in dermatology and cosmetic care – helping shield the skin from environmental damage. Antiseptic and antiviral Sandalwood essential oil is known for its strong antiseptic and antiviral properties – making it a valuable natural remedy. Antiseptic refers to substances that prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms and sandalwood oil contains alpha-santalol and other phenolic compounds that help inhibit microbial growth . This makes it effective for protecting internal ulcers and wounds from infection. When applied topically, it can also prevent infections in boils, pimples and sores by creating an environment that's less favorable for bacteria , as noted in a study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology. In addition to its antiseptic qualities, sandalwood essential oil exhibits antiviral properties – meaning it can help prevent or treat viral infections by stopping viruses from multiplying and spreading. Research published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy indicates that sandalwood essential oil can inhibit common viruses, including herpes simplex viruses -1 and -2. When diluted with a carrier oil, like coconut oil or jojoba oil, it can soothe irritation and inflammation from boils, minor wounds, pimples and warts. You can use sandalwood oil as a natural remedy for sore throat by gargling it with a cup of water – providing another way to harness its antiseptic and antiviral benefits. Anxiety relief Anxiolytic substances help reduce anxiety, which can include feelings of fear, tension, uneasiness or worry . Sandalwood oil has been shown to have anti-anxiety effects, similar to other aromatherapy oils, like lavender, orange and peppermint. In a study published in Worldview on Evidence-based Nursing , nearly 90 women undergoing breast biopsies reported feeling less anxious after using these essential oils during aromatherapy. Another study, published in Natural Product Communications , found that people who inhaled sandalwood and lavender oils had lower blood pressure and cortisol (a stress hormone) levels – further supporting sandalwood’s calming effects. Astringent An astringent is a substance that causes tissues to contract, which can help reduce bleeding or control secretions. Sandalwood essential oil has mild astringent properties – thanks to its compound alpha-santalol, which helps tighten and strengthen tissues, like gums, muscles and skin. This makes it useful for maintaining oral health and even as a disinfectant in areas, like the bronchial and urinary tracts. For the skin, sandalwood’s astringent effects can cause gentle tightening, which is why it is often found in products, like aftershaves and facial toners. These properties help cleanse, firm and soothe the skin, while its antioxidants may also refresh the skin and reduce signs of aging. Better sleep The deep, slightly sweet and woody scent of sandalwood essential oil can help those who struggle to fall asleep at night. Its calming aroma promotes relaxation, making it easier to unwind before bedtime. A 2007 study published in Nihon Shinkei Yakurigaku Zushhi found that the compound alpha-santalol in sandalwood significantly induces sedation in rats and reduces their overall waking time . While more research is needed to confirm these effects in humans, many people say that sandalwood’s soothing scent helps them achieve better sleep. Wound healing In 2014, researchers at Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (RUB) found that sandalwood oil may help speed up wound healing and recovery. The study showed that skin cells, specifically ones with olfactory receptors for sandalwood (called OR2AT4), were able to heal faster when these receptors were activated. This activation triggers a calcium-based signaling pathway, which boosts the growth and movement of skin cells – two key processes in helping wounds heal and repair more quickly .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-genetically-modified-crops-growing-threat-health-environment.html,Genetically modified crops: A growing threat to health and the environment,"Bioengineered foods and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are commonly confused with each other, but they have different meanings. ""Bioengineered"" describes food and products that are enhanced with scientific techniques to add particular traits. In contrast, ""GMOs"" involve changing the genetic makeup of animals, plants or microbes in ways that do not occur naturally using methods like genetic engineering. Health risks posed by GM foods Some notable issues related to the consumption of GM foods and products include the following: Allergic reactions Genetic modifications can transfer allergens from one food to another. For instance, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) revealed that soybeans engineered with a Brazil nut gene caused allergic reactions in people who are nut-sensitive. This led to the withdrawal of some products due to this serious risk. Without proper labeling, people with allergies can unknowingly consume these harmful ingredients. New allergens GM food and products might also introduce new allergens. The genetic changes can create novel proteins not previously in the human diet, potentially triggering allergic responses . Despite warnings from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists about this risk, mandatory long-term testing for new allergens is not required, leaving many consumers, especially children, at risk of severe allergic reactions. Antibiotic resistance GM foods and products could potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat infections. According to the Food Standards Agency , most GM foods contain ""antibiotic resistance markers ,"" which help identify successful genetic modifications. However, introducing these markers into the food supply might render essential antibiotics, like ampicillin, ineffective against bacterial infections. This concern led several European countries, including Britain, to ban certain GM crops for fear of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Despite warnings from scientists, the FDA has continued to allow these markers in GM foods even though public health experts view them as a significant threat. Cancer risk In 1993, the FDA approved the use of genetically engineered recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH ) to boost milk production in cows, assuring consumers of its safety. However, Canada and Europe later banned the treatment due to concerns about animal and human health. Research has shown that dairy from rBGH-treated cows has higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone linked to breast, colon and prostate cancers . While the FDA overlooked studies showing that IGF-1 can survive digestion and enter the bloodstream – increasing cancer risk – the American Cancer Society states there is no current evidence linking GMOs to cancer and more long-term research is needed. Immunosuppression A study published in The Lancet by Dr. Arpad Pusztai and Stanley W.B. Ewen, funded by the Scottish government, investigated the effects of GM potatoes containing the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) on rats. The research found that rats consuming these potatoes experienced negative impacts on their immune function, metabolism and organ development . Although the biotechnology industry criticized Pusztai's work, they haven't provided any studies to disprove his findings. Additionally, 22 leading scientists have supported the validity of animal tests linking GM foods to immuno-suppression. Loss of nutrition Genetic engineering can reduce the nutritional value of food. In 1992, FDA scientists warned that altering foods genetically might lead to ""undesirable changes in nutrient levels."" They highlighted the risk that these changes could go unnoticed without specific testing. Despite these concerns, the FDA chose not to require mandatory testing for nutritional content in GM foods. Toxicity GM foods are unstable by nature. The process of inserting new genes into food is unpredictable, with no way to ensure the added genetic material doesn't create harmful effects. This randomness means that each gene insertion could potentially turn safe food into something toxic . FDA scientists were aware of this risk before setting their policy of no mandatory testing. They warned that genetic engineering could increase known toxins, introduce new ones, or cause foods to absorb more environmental toxins, like heavy metals and pesticides. Despite these warnings, the FDA chose to ignore the potential dangers and didn’t require toxicological testing for GM foods, prioritizing industry interests over food safety. GMOs and their environmental impact GMOs pose several environmental risks , including: Gene transfer outcrossing. There is a risk that genes from GMO crops could spread to wild plants and other crops, potentially creating unintended hybrids that could disrupt ecosystems. Impact on wildlife. Introducing GMOs into the environment can harm insects and other species. For example, dominant GMO species may outcompete and displace native species, upsetting the natural balance. Loss of biodiversity. The use of GM seeds, like Monsanto's Roundup-resistant crops , can lead to reduced plant diversity. These GM seeds are designed to survive glyphosate, a pesticide that kills weeds but spares the crops. While this innovation saves farmers time and money by reducing the need for multiple pesticides, it also forces them to buy new seeds every year due to Monsanto's patent rather than reusing seeds from previous harvests. (Related: GMOs linked to increased pesticide use and loss of biodiversity .) Introduction of GM organisms. Releasing GM animals, organisms or plants into the wild can further threaten biodiversity by allowing new, more dominant species to take over . This could lead to the decline or extinction of native species. Tips to reduce GMO exposure Examine labels. While the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (NBFDS) mandates labels for many GMO products, certain items, like GM animal products and refined ingredients (such as oils and sugars) are not required to be labeled. Instead of relying solely on these labels, look for the Non-GMO Project Verified seal , which ensures that the product has been certified GMO-free. Go organic. Opt for organic produce as organic farming regulations strictly ban the use of GMOs in animal feeds, crops and seeds. Choosing organic is a reliable way to avoid GMOs in your diet. Cook your meals. Preparing meals at home with organic ingredients allows you to reduce your exposure to GMOs, which are common in processed and restaurant foods. Support local farmers. Shopping at local farmers' markets can help you avoid GMOs, as many small-scale farmers use traditional, non-GMO seeds. However, it is a good idea to ask farmers directly about their farming practices to ensure you're buying GMO-free produce. Limit consumption of processed foods. Processed and ultra-processed foods often contain GMO-derived ingredients, like emulsifiers, oils and sweeteners. To minimize GMO intake, reduce your consumption of these foods which may not disclose their GMO content. Stay informed. Refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture' s (USDA) bioengineered food list to identify foods that are likely to contain GMOs. This can help you to make informed choices at the grocery store or supermarket. Visit GMO.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-american-water-nations-largest-water-utility-cyberattack.html,"American Water, nation’s largest water utility, hit with CYBERATTACK that left call center with “limited functionality”","Customers of the nation's largest water utility, American Water, were left unable to pay their bills this past week after a cyberattack left the company's billing system non-operational. American Water says it identified ""unauthorized activity"" taking place within its computer networks and systems that was later determined to be a ""cybersecurity incident"" that deactivated and disconnected certain key elements of the system. Once again demonstrating the risks involved with the tech revolution, the cyberattack resulted in a temporary billing pause for American Water customers, reports indicate, as the company's call center was left with ""limited functionality."" The company says it is ""working diligently"" to get everything back in working order. There will also be a third-party investigation by cybersecurity professionals to determine what happened and why, a process that could take a bit of time to resolve. Because some 14 million people in 14 states rely on American Water for their taps to function, the company is also bringing in law enforcement to help conduct an investigation into the matter. American Water says that neither its water or wastewater facilities and operations were negatively impacted by the cybersecurity attack, which the company says means its water is still safe to drink. ""Our dedicated team of professionals are working around the clock to investigate the nature and scope of the incident,"" company officials said in a statement. ""We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause, and we are working diligently to remediate and to bring these systems back online in a safe and secure manner."" (Related: Taiwan-based Gold Apollo plans to ""sue Israel"" for allegedly hacking the company's pagers to turn them into deadly explosives.) Are foreign adversaries targeting American water supplies? American Water reportedly manages some 540 different groundwater treatment plants in 1,700 U.S. communities. The 14 states in which American Water operates include: • California • Georgia • Hawaii • Illinois • Indiana • Iowa • Kentucky • Maryland • Missouri • New Jersey • Pennsylvania • Tennessee • Virginia • West Virginia The latest reports indicate that some of the publicly-traded company's online systems, including its website and telecommunications system, are still non-operational as of October 8, this despite the cyberattack incident happening a full five days prior on October 3. Keep in mind that American Water also provides water to 18 U.S. military installations, which means that they, too, are impacted by the prolonged outage. Some 6,500 people work for American Water. The outages primarily impact American Water's customer-facing sites, including the ""MyWater"" customer portal which is still serving up blank pages that contain ""Forbidden 403"" text with no way to log in. An attendant from the company's Camden, N.J., headquarters confirmed to Dark Reading that she cannot even connect with members of the media, nor can anyone leave a message for her, because American Water's telecommunications system ""is down."" Critical infrastructure like water has been the subject of concern in recent years, specifically as it pertains to the threat of cyberattacks. Many have been warning for some time now that this kind of thing will happen more and more as hackers, possibly of the foreign enemy variety, target the country for destruction. Recall what happened in May 2021 to the Colonial Pipeline when a ransomware attack left the fuel supply line non-operational. That same year in February, hackers also targeted a Florida water-treatment facility that, had an employee not noticed it an acted quickly, could have resulted in the public water supply being poisoned. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 70 percent of the nation's community drinking water systems fail to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act, which includes having cybersecurity safety measures in place to protect against crippling cyberattacks. In the age of tech, cyberattacks threaten to destroy entire nations that rely on it to keep things running normally. Learn more at CyberWar.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-trudeau-govt-condemned-launching-online-abortion-portal.html,Pro-life organization condemns Trudeau government for making it “easier” to kill babies with online abortion portal,"Canada's top pro-life organization has condemned the Trudeau government for launching an online abortion portal that makes it easier for women to ""kill their babies."" ""Abortion in Canada,"" which was activated on Sept. 26, provides users with guidance and resources, including information on types of abortion, available support systems and government initiatives related to reproductive health and abortion services. The portal, accessible through the Canada.ca website under the Health-Healthy-Living-Sexual-Reproductive Health section, easily directs women to abortion facilities and attacks life-saving crisis pregnancy centers. Pete Baklinski, the director of communications for the Campaign Life Coalition (CLC), said the portal makes it ""easier for Canadians to kill their unborn babies."" ""The Trudeau Liberals just launched a new'‘abortion services portal' to make it easier for Canadians to kill their preborn children,"" Baklinski posted on X. (Related: Texas AG Ken Paxton sues Biden HHS over proposed rule that would hide abortion info from criminal investigations .) Baklinski also argued that the federal government and the online abortion portal misrepresent abortion as healthcare through misleading information. ""The government portal falsely calls abortion 'healthcare.' Abortion has nothing to do with ‘health’ or care for others. It has everything to do with destroying lives, relationships, and undermining the nation,"" he wrote. Baklinski also added that the site ""outright lies by stating that women have a 'fundamental right' to choose abortion,"" when in fact there is no ""right"" to abortion in Canada. ""It’s not in the Charter. It didn't come from the 1988 Morgentaler decision. It's nowhere. Just plain government lies."" Moreover, Baklinski defended crisis pregnancy centers as the abortion portal warned the public about it with a yellow warning sign. ""Predictably, the portal warns users about 'crisis pregnancy centers,' using an orange caution sign. The portal states that these centers 'often look like clinics or support centers, but they are designed to discourage people from getting an abortion,'"" Baklinski said. He then claimed that in reality, pregnancy crisis centers ""save countless lives"" and ""should be supported by our government, not denigrated for the amazing work that they do in helping mothers and children."" Baklinski: Canada needs a law that would protect unborn babies In line with this, Baklinski argued in September that Canada urgently needs legislation that would protect unborn babies from their mothers' wombs . He pointed out that in contrast to the claims of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) leader Pierre Poilievre, Canada has been without abortion laws since the R. v. Morgentaler Supreme Court decision in 1988 . The decision removed federal restrictions on abortion, and the Parliament has not passed new legislation since. This, in turn, led to unrestricted access to abortion at any stage of pregnancy. ""Yes, Canada needs a law. It needs a just law the protects children from being killed in their mothers’ wombs,"" Baklinski wrote on X, in response to the heated argument between Trudeau and Poilievre during the Sept. 25 parliamentary session. ""It has been said that a nation will be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. Preborn human children are the most vulnerable among us. These smallest members of the human family are waiting for a day of justice."" Head over to Abortions.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-study-black-plastic-products-toxic-flame-retardants.html,"Study finds BLACK PLASTIC in toys, food containers contains TOXIC flame retardants","A recently published study in the journal Chemosphere has concluded that toys, takeout food containers, kitchen utensils and other common household products made from black plastic have high levels of toxic flame retardants , the Defender reported. The research conducted by Toxic-Free Future and the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment has further warned how flame retardants are linked to carcinogenicity , endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity and reproductive harm. According to the paper, the contamination starts with the improper recycling of electronic products like televisions, whose casings are made from black plastic. When the said plastic casings are mixed with other plastics during recycling, the flame retardants make their way into the end product. (Related: Plastic recycling is a SCAM: Recycled plastics are more TOXIC than new ones .) While the study was being conducted, the researchers screened 203 products made from black plastics for bromine, a man-made chemical used in flame retardants. The results showed that toxic flame retardants were present in 85 percent of the products analyzed, with concentrations reaching 22,800 milligrams per kilogram. The contaminants found were decabromodiphenyl ether, or decaBDE, a compound commonly used in the casings of electronics before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned it in 2021. One compound, decabromodiphenyl ether, or BDE-209, was commonly found in black-colored plastic kitchen utensils at an average level of 34,700 nanograms per day. A 2014 study published in the journal Frontiers in Genetics found that BDE-209 has highly carcinogenic effects on humans. Other contaminants detected include compound 2,4,6-tribromophenol, which has been detected in human breast milk, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Environmental Pollution . ""The findings of flame retardants in children's toys are of particular concern because flame retardants have been found to leach from toys into children's saliva,"" said Megan Liu, science and policy manager for Toxic-Free Future. ""Flame retardants are a highly hazardous class of chemicals, but they are still allowed for use in products like electronics, and as a result of dirty electronic-waste recycling, we're seeing flame retardants appear in unexpected products, like our kitchen utensils, food service ware and hair accessories."" Experts call for stronger regulations against toxic contaminants in plastics Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, has called for stricter scrutiny from U.S. health agencies. ""The [ U.S. Food and Drug Administration ] FDA and EPA need to scrutinize the safety of all plastic products used with foods, instead of the vague reassurances the agencies have been offering,"" said Zuckerman. Liu told the Defender that she also demanded the need for stronger regulations on hazardous chemicals and materials entering the recycling stream. ""What we need is our state and federal government, along with retailers, to ban these harmful chemicals and materials,"" Liu said. ""We need policy and market change to increase the transparency of what's being used in the supply chain, including for recycled materials, as well as require the use of safer solutions."" She noted that the study's results were published ""at a critical time when leaders around the world are negotiating a Global Plastics Treaty."" The ongoing negotiations for this treaty come two years after the United Nations Environment Assembly passed a resolution that resolution calls for the completion of a legally binding international treaty by the end of 2024. In the meantime, Liu wants people to reduce any uses of plastics, including replacing plastic kitchen utensils with safer options, like wood or stainless steel. Plastic containers should be replaced with glass containers. Visit Pollution.news to read stories about how plastics harm the environment.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-black-cumin-tiny-seed-big-healing-powers.html,Black cumin: The tiny seed with big healing powers,"In the world of natural remedies, few plants boast a history as revered and enduring as Nigella sativa , commonly known as black cumin or black seed. For over 2,500 years, this tiny seed has been a cornerstone of traditional medicine – with roots that trace back to ancient civilizations. Even the Egyptians, famed for their advanced knowledge of medicine, valued black seed. Archaeological findings suggest its importance, with black cumin discovered in the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun – hinting at its role in ancient Egyptian healing practices. References to black seed are also found in religious texts. The Old Testament's book of Isaiah mentions it and Easton's Bible Dictionary explains that the Hebrew word ""ketsah"" refers to N. sativa . In the Islamic tradition, the seed also holds special significance. The Prophet Muhammad famously said: "" The black seed can heal every disease, except death ."" This prophetic endorsement has made black seed an integral part of Islamic medicine for centuries, where it is revered not only for its therapeutic properties but also for its symbolic significance as part of the ""Medicine of the Prophet."" The black seed's association with religious teachings helped spread its use far and wide – especially with the rise of Islam in the 7th century. Its use has never been restricted throughout Islamic history – remaining a constant in treating illnesses. Throughout history, black cumin has earned a reputation as a ""panacea"" – a remedy for nearly every ailment . Different medical traditions have used black cumin seed in various forms, such as extracts, oils, pastes and powders, to treat a broad spectrum of conditions. These include back pain , headaches, inflammatory problems like arthritis and rheumatism, mental fatigue, respiratory issues like asthma and bronchitis, and skin disorders like acne and eczema. It has also been used to manage more severe ailments, such as amenorrhea, hypertension and even paralysis. The seeds' wide use in traditional remedies is attributed to their diverse medicinal properties, which have been recognized for centuries. These properties include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects. Whether it's aiding digestion, boosting immunity or protecting the heart , black cumin has been celebrated as a versatile healing agent across many cultures. Modern science explains black cumin's healing properties The potency of N. sativa as a medicinal herb lies in its complex and diverse phytochemical composition. However, this composition can vary depending on the region where the plant is grown, its maturity, processing methods and extraction techniques. The bioactive compounds in black cumin , which are responsible for its wide range of healing properties, can be classified into several chemical groups: Terpenes and terpenoids The largest and most significant group of chemicals in black cumin seeds are terpenes and terpenoids. Among these, thymoquinone (TQ) stands out as the most researched and potent compound. TQ and its derivatives – including alpha-pinene, carvacrol, thymol and thymohydroquinone – are known for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial antioxidant properties. These compounds are largely responsible for black cumin's versatility in treating various health conditions – from inflammation to respiratory issues. Phytosterols The oil extracted from black cumin seeds is rich in phytosterols, particularly beta-sitosterol, which makes up about 44 to 54 percent of the total sterol content. Other important sterols include campesterol, delta-7 avenasterol and stigmasterol – key players in lowering cholesterol levels and promoting heart and cardiovascular health. Alkaloids Black cumin seeds also contain several alkaloids, which are bioactive compounds known for their medicinal effects. The major alkaloids include nigellicimine, nigellicimine-N-oxide, nigellicine and nigellidine, which have been linked to benefits in lipid (fat) metabolism and possess anticancer and neuroprotective properties – further enhancing black cumin's medicinal reputation. Tocols (vitamin E) Black cumin is a rich source of tocopherols, a family of compounds that make up vitamin E. Tocopherols are powerful antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage and prevent lipid peroxidation. Black cumin contains four tocopherol isomers – alpha-, beta-, delta- and gamma-tocopherols – with gamma tocopherols being the most abundant. The high tocopherol content contributes to black cumin's role in preventing chronic diseases linked to oxidative stress, such as cancer and heart disease. Polyphenols Black cumin seeds are packed with polyphenols, a class of antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation. Nineteen polyphenols have been identified in black cumin, including caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, kaemferol and quercetin. Among these most studied polyphenols, kaempferol and quercetin are found in the highest concentrations and are known to protect against diseases like cardiovascular problems, osteoporosis and certain cancers. Kaempferol, in particular, has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or bad cholesterol – helping to prevent arteriosclerosis. Miscellaneous compounds In addition to its primary phytochemical groups, black cumin seeds contain a variety of other beneficial compounds. These include special carbohydrates (such as arabinose, rhamnose and xylose), glycerolipids (mono-, di- and triacylglycerols), phospholipids and vitamins, such as vitamin C and several B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine and folic acid). Black cumin seeds also contain important minerals, such as calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium and zinc, and minor amounts of alkane hydrocarbons – further enhancing its role as a well-rounded natural remedy. While black cumin's traditional uses have been well-documented, modern science has begun to reveal the mechanisms behind its healing powers. The seed's essential oil , in particular, contains a range of powerful compounds – with thymoquinone being the most studied. Other active components, such as alpha-hederin, carvacrol, nigellicine, nigellidine, thymohydroquinone and thymol, also contribute to its pharmacological effects – giving it a wide range of therapeutic benefits. Though its food value is often overlooked in scientific literature, black cumin seeds are rich in both macro- and micronutrients. They provide significant amounts of proteins and healthy fats, particularly essential fatty acids like linoleic and oleic acids vital for heart health. Additionally, black cumin contains the vitamins and minerals previously mentioned – making black cumin not only a medicinal herb but also a nutritionally valuable food source.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-hospitals-face-decrease-iv-fluids-supply-hurricane.html,Hurricane Helene shuts down top IV fluid producer as it alerts hospitals of possible 40% decrease in supply,"A medical technology company responsible for making IV fluids for most U.S. hospitals, last week announced that it would temporarily close production at its North Cove, North Carolina-based facility because of the damages brought by Hurricane Helene – raising major concern about a potential nationwide shortage of IV fluids supply . Baxter International, the top producer of IV fluid, alerted hospitals to expect its supply to plummet by 40 percent from typical levels, according to Dr. Paul Biddinger, the chief preparedness and continuity officer at Boston's Mass General Brigham Hospital, which uses more than 100,000 liters of IV fluid from Baxter every month. ""The company is working around the clock in close coordination with local, state and federal officials to assess the extent of the damage and implement a plan to bring the plant back online as quickly as possible to help mitigate supply disruption to patients,"" the Deerfield, IL-based Baxter said in a statement. Critical for surgery when a person is unable to eat or drink, IV fluids deliver drugs or water with electrolytes directly into a patient's bloodstream to keep them hydrated. The company also makes specialty fluids, such as peritoneal dialysis fluid, which helps patients with kidney failure filter waste from their blood, as well as irrigation fluids, used during procedures to clean or flush wounds. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that two other large manufacturers of IV fluids in the U.S. are also working to increase supply. ""[U.S. Food and Drug Administration] FDA's drug shortage office is in touch with Baxter about impacts to products manufactured at the facility and will continue to coordinate with [Federal Emergency Management Agency] FEMA to assist the company with cleanup of the facility,"" the spokesperson said. B. Braun Medical, which accounts for about 23 percent of the IV fluids market, is looking to increase the supply of the ""most critical products"" or ""hospital workhorses,"" such as large-volume bags — 500 milliliters to 2,000 milliliters — of sodium chloride, sterile water and lactated ringers. It is also hiring new employees and hopes to be running 24/7 at two of its facilities in the coming weeks. ICU Medical, another IV fluid supplier, said it's monitoring for potential increases in demand. It has ""already taken necessary steps to increase production to help meet market needs,"" spokesperson Harrison Richards said. Hospitals start conserving supplies, finding other ways to manage patients' needs According to reports, a breached levee was a factor in the flooding of Baxter's plant in Marion, North Carolina, which usually produces 1.5 million bags a day. However, producing as much will be more difficult because of the broken bridges nearby, limiting transport in and out. Baxter said that it would not be able to set a timeline for the resumption of operations at the facility. (Related: Hurricane Helene death toll now over 200 as disaster relief operations continue .) The company shares dipped 2.47 percent that week, edging up 0.63 percent in after-hours trading. Meanwhile, Mass General Brigham is among hospitals that are already implementing measures to make the most of their inventory . It is now urging staff to consider using Gatorade or water in situations where that can fulfill patient hydration needs comparably to an IV drip. ""Patients are still getting IV fluids when they need them,"" said Biddinger. ""We are continuing normal medical services but emphasizing conservation and we are carefully monitoring this incident to determine how long it may last, how long we may need to conserve and making sure we identified all areas of our enterprise where services are affected."" New Jersey-based WJBarnabas Health also said it is taking ""appropriate conservation measures"" across its health system as it assesses the supply affected by Baxter. ""At this time, there is no impact on patient care,"" said Carrie Cristello, a spokesperson for RWJBarnabas. ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely."" In a statement, Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, which was also affected by the Baxter closure, said it is keeping its community informed of any changes that could be needed in patient care, research or education missions. The hospital is also using oral hydration options when possible, as well as evaluating each patient for the discontinuation of continuous IV fluids. Northwestern Medicine in Illinois said its supply chain team is discussing conservation efforts, as well. ""We anticipate this will be a long-term issue,"" said Jenny Nowatzke, a spokesperson. ZeroHedge pointed out how the White House and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are currently facing a massive backlash of anger and frustration over its response to Hurricane Helene. ""A crisis in hospitals will only exacerbate that dynamic,"" the news outlet added. The death toll from Hurricane Helene has risen to over 200 as millions in the Southeastern states are left in the dark. President Joe Biden's administration continues to assess the damage, especially in the Carolinas, though reports from unnamed sources reveal that ""the real death toll is really over 2,000 people.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-leftists-want-pre-bunk-children-conspiracy-theories.html,Perverted Leftists want to “pre-bunk” children from “conspiracy theories” while they brainwash them into gender-bender surgery and cancer-inducing hormone drugs,"There is nothing more insidious than adults who prey on children and try to influence them to think and act in perverted ways that often lead to sexual abuse, torture and death. There are many hidden agendas that are integral to the whole “misinformation” and “disinformation” campaigns the U.S. government, Big Tech and Big Pharma are running in full force now, but the brainwashing, perverting and trafficking of children and teens is at the top of the Communist-Democrat-Liberal heap, and it’s getting worse by the day. The cover story, of course, is that Conservatives are spreading “conspiracy theories” about everything, from white supremacy to corrupt medicine, and from war mongering to open borders. Now, you can’t even ask questions about Leftist ideologies or you are considered to be spreading misinformation and disinformation. There’s no questioning the gender-bender movement, deadly mRNA vaccines or the money laundering communists in Washington DC or you’re considered a “domestic terrorist” and a “threat to democracy.” This requires careful consideration. “Social engineers” of social media publish propaganda with the main intent of indoctrinating children and teens into perverted ideological positions Do not put anything past the sick people who abuse children, warp their minds and spread the twisted propaganda on social media to feed this agenda. One big part of keeping the wars overseas going and the U.S. southern border wide open is to fuel human trafficking and drug trafficking, which helps these perverts capture, abuse and kill kids of all races, creeds, gender and ages. Have no illusions, the movement to censor “misinformation” comes from these very people at the top of the U.S. government, Big Tech and Big Pharma (think the Clintons, Bidens, Obamas, Epstein, Diddy, Hollywood, Disney and the list goes on). This blatant censorship has never been more apparent than during the Covid scamdemic. Nobody was allowed to question the fake PCR tests, the “deaths” from Covid, the deadly clot shots, Fauci’s “expert” advice or the CDC’s lies and propaganda that killed millions of people in hospitals (think protocol of ventilators, isolation, remdesivir and dirty vaccines). During this reign of medical terror, we also witnessed the most extreme perverts spreading propaganda on social media so children and teenagers would be convinced they’re all suffering from “gender dysphoria” and need to “switch” genders to be happy, which includes digesting misinformation and disinformation about gender-bender surgeries, dangerous hormone prescription drugs, and accusing everyone of misgendering them when they “self-identify” as the opposite gender or as a “furry” animal that uses the litter box in the public school bathroom. Many medical doctors, psychologists , scientists and teachers have conspired to warp children’s minds (and bodies) through the misinformation and mass-censorship campaigns waged against people who have values, ethics and morals. The Censorship Industrial Complex (CIC) is a weapon of mass destruction, and radical Leftists like Hitlery Clinton and Kommie Harris lead the charge to use this weapon for insane, perverted, destructive motives and agendas. Anyone who opposes the CIC is persecuted and prosecuted by Big Brother, Big Tech and Big Pharma.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-superfood-pomegranate-fights-cardiovascular-diseases-diabetes-cancer.html,"Superfood pomegranate helps fight cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer","The pomegranate is a sweet, ruby-red fruit that isn't just beautiful to look at, but is also emerging as a powerful ally in the fight against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer . Pomegranates are packed with compounds that support overall health and well-being. Each part of the fruit – from the juicy seeds to the outer skin – is brimming with nutrients and bioactive compounds. The juice from the arils (those jewel-like seed pods) is loaded with plant-based compounds, such as flavonoids and tannins known for their antioxidant properties. These antioxidants help protect cells from damage and fight inflammation. Pomegranates also contain fatty acids, organic acids and even phytosterols, which are compounds that can help lower cholesterol levels. The thick outer layer of the fruit, called the pericarp, makes up almost half of the pomegranate's weight and contains some of its most potent ingredients. It is especially rich in ellagitannins and punicalagins – powerful antioxidants that neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. This part of the fruit is also a source of essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy body. Pomegranate seeds are also full of healthy fats, including omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids, which are important for heart health and reducing inflammation. They also contain organic acids like ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which supports immune function and citric acid, known for its cleansing properties. Even the leaves of the pomegranate tree play a role in promoting wellness. They contain tannins and flavonoids like apigenin and luteolin, compounds linked to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It is important to note that the exact nutrient profile of a pomegranate can vary depending on factors like where it's grown, how it's cultivated and how the fruit is processed. But no matter the variety, pomegranates are undoubtedly packed with health-promoting compounds . Pomegranates help lower risk of cardiovascular diseases Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of illness and death worldwide. While many factors, such as age, diet and lifestyle, play a role in heart disease, research shows that adding pomegranates to the diet help lower risk. Recent studies have shown that pomegranates contain a variety of compounds – like antioxidants, healthy acids and polyphenols – that can help protect the heart . One clinical trial in the Journal of Nutritional Science found that participants who took pomegranate extract daily saw a significant reduction in their blood pressure after just eight weeks. Researchers believe pomegranate's phenolic compounds help relax blood vessels and reduce hypertension , a major risk factor for heart disease. In another study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , researchers explored how pomegranate compounds might combat obesity and diabetes, which are both closely linked to heart disease. They treated fat cells with pomegranate juice and its active compounds – ellagic acid, punicalagin and urolithin A. These compounds not only reduced the accumulation of fat in the cells but also decreased the release of enzymes that promote blood sugar spikes and fat storage. This effect on fat and glucose metabolism is particularly promising for those at risk of diabetes – a major contributor to heart disease. In short, pomegranates and their bioactive compounds – especially punicalagins and urolithins – support heart health by lowering blood pressure, reducing cholesterol and helping the body manage fat and blood sugar. Pomegranates help lower blood sugar levels Pomegranates could also manage diabetes. A 2022 study in Antioxidants highlighted pomegranate juice's potential as a natural way to lower blood sugar levels thanks to its unique combination of bioactive compounds. These compounds work together to support the body’s ability to process glucose and reduce oxidative stress , which is a key driver of diabetes complications. Research shows that drinking pomegranate juice can boost insulin sensitivity and help cells absorb more glucose, which is essential for keeping blood sugar levels in check. The juice also helps protect the pancreas's beta-cells, which produce insulin and prevent the harmful buildup of sugars on proteins (a process known as glycation), which can damage tissues over time. Pomegranate compounds also act on key enzymes that regulate sugar breakdown in the body. For example, they inhibit enzymes like alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, which slow down the absorption of sugar from food. This means less sugar enters the bloodstream after meals – leading to more stable blood sugar levels. At the same time, the juice helps to reduce inflammation, which is often elevated in people with diabetes. In addition to its antioxidant properties, pomegranate juice also activates certain receptors, which improve the body's sensitivity to insulin. All of these actions combine to help the body regulate glucose more effectively – offering a natural way to support diabetes management . Pomegranates help protect against certain types of cancer Pomegranates are being explored for the potential to help protect against cancer. Thanks to their powerful bioactive compounds, including antioxidants like ellagic acid and punicalagin, pomegranates can influence key processes involved in cancer development. These compounds work in several ways to target cancer cells. First, they can slow down tumor growth by interfering with pathways cancer cells use to multiply . For example, pomegranate extracts have been shown to block specific proteins like cyclin D1, which cancer cells rely on to grow. In breast cancer cell models, pomegranate compounds also reduced the activity of estrogen receptors, which are involved in tumor proliferation. Pomegranate's anticancer effects extend beyond growth inhibition. Studies on lung and prostate cancer cells have shown that pomegranate compounds can trigger apoptosis – essentially causing cancer cells to self-destruct. In one study in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy , extracts from the fruit's peel promoted the production of proteins that encourage cell death , while reducing the levels of proteins that prevent it. This dual action helps to limit cancer cell survival. (Related: Pomegranates are a cancer-fighting superfood: Here are 4 reasons why .) In addition to promoting apoptosis, pomegranates may help reduce the spread of cancer cells . They have been shown to inhibit metastasis – the process by which cancer spreads to other parts of the body – by blocking enzymes like MMP-2 and MMP-9, which play a role in tumor cell invasion. Overall, pomegranates show promising potential as a natural addition to cancer treatment strategies. Their compounds work at multiple levels – blocking growth, promoting cell death and preventing the spread of cancer. While more research is needed, these findings suggest pomegranates could play a supporting role in cancer prevention and therapy. Visit Superfoods.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-lifestyle-habits-for-a-longer-healthier-life.html,"Lifestyle habits to adopt now for a longer, healthier life","National Institute on Aging Scientific Director Dr. Luigi Ferrucci shared evidence-based strategies from geriatricians on how to extend your lifespan and healthspan , adding more vibrant years to your life. Stay active Experts agree that keeping your body moving is essential for extending both your lifespan and healthspan. Research consistently shows that regular exercise and staying physically active as you age lowers the risk of early death. A study published in JAMA International Medicine highlighted that increasing physical activity could prevent many deaths among U.S. adults. Another study published in Circulation that same year found that engaging in 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise , 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, is linked to a lower risk of dying from various causes. Regular physical activity benefits the circulatory system, heart and overall health, and it also helps prevent chronic diseases and falls particularly in older adults. Professor of Geriatric Medicine and Hospice and Palliative Medicine Dr. Anna Chang at the University of California, San Francisco notes that developing balance and coordination, cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength early in life sets a strong foundation for aging gracefully. Find the exercise you enjoy and can stick with. Just walking for a little over 20 minutes a day can meet the American Heart Association’s recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, making a significant impact on your health. Eat more fruits and vegetables Experts recommend focusing on moderation, with an emphasis on eating more organic fruits and vegetables while cutting back on processed foods. The Mediterranean diet – rich in fish, fresh produce, legumes, nuts, olive oil and whole grains – is a great example of a healthy and nutritious eating pattern. It’s been linked to a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, dementia and heart disease. (Related: Longevity science: Study reveals benefits of nutraceuticals and the Mediterranean diet when it comes to improving lifespan .) While maintaining a healthy weight is often seen as important, Professor of Health Policy and Aging Dr. John Rowe at Columbia University s uggests that it becomes less critical as people age. In fact, he’s more concerned about patients who lose weight than those who gain it. (Related: Experts, studies recommend eating like your ancestors to boost longevity .) Prioritize good sleep Don’t underestimate the importance of sleep in healthy aging. Research shows that getting adequate, quality sleep is linked to a lower risk of early death and can even extend your lifespan. Good sleep is vital for brain health as well. Research published in the journal Aging revealed that people who slept fewer than five hours a night faced twice the risk of dementia. Addressing sleep issues can significantly reduce the risk of both dementia and overall mortality in older adults. University of California, San Diego, Chief of Geriatrics, Gerontology and Palliative Care Dr. Alison Moore suggests that as you age, you actually need more sleep –aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep a night for optimal health and overall well-being. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption It is well known that smoking is harmful and increases the risk of many serious diseases . As Rowe puts it: ""There is no safe level of cigarette smoke."" Excessive alcohol consumption is also increasingly recognized as a health risk. Drinking more than one drink per day for women or two for men can raise the chances of developing heart disease, liver issues and several cancers , including breast, colorectal, esophageal, head and neck and liver cancers. Manage chronic conditions According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may Americans face chronic health issues: nearly half have high blood pressure , 40 percent have high cholesterol and over a third have pre-diabetes . While healthy habits can help manage these conditions, sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough. It is crucial to follow your doctor’s advice and consider more natural management and treatment options to keep these conditions under control. Chang emphasizes that although monitoring and medication might not be enjoyable, managing these aspects effectively contributes to a longer, healthier life. Prioritize your relationships Mental health is as crucial as physical health. Chang notes that loneliness can be as harmful as smoking, increasing the risk of dementia, heart disease and stroke. Strong relationships are essential for both happiness and health. The Harvard Study of Adult Development shows that good relationships are the top predictor of well-being . Massachusetts General Hospital psychiatrist Dr. Waldinger adds that loneliness is as damaging as alcoholism or smoking. The study found that close connections, more than fame or wealth, lead to better health throughout life and greater happiness. They protect against life’s challenges and are stronger indicators of a long, happy life than genetics, IQ or social class. Rowe highlights that one of the best ways to gauge an elderly patient’s future well-being is by asking about their social interactions. Maintaining relationships is a key part of self-care. Cultivate a positive mindset Optimism can also contribute to a longer life. Studies, including one published in JAMA Network Open , reveal that optimistic people tend to live five to 15 percent longer and have a lower risk of heart disease. This is likely due to healthier habits and lower rates of chronic conditions among optimistic adults, even when other factors are considered. Find more stories like this at Longevity.news .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-frankincense-fights-inflammation-offers-many-health-benefits.html,Power of FRANKINCENSE: This ancient resin fights inflammation and offers many health benefits,"Frankincense ( Boswellia serrata ), a fragrant resin often paired with myrrh, has been valued for centuries and is mentioned frequently in the Bible. This aromatic substance, which contains a natural oil, has been widely used in incense and perfumes throughout history. It played a key role in religious ceremonies in Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, where it was burned during worships and funerals. Aside from its spiritual uses, frankincense has a long history as a traditional remedy. It was used to treat digestive issues, respiratory infections and inflammation. Even today, it remains a popular incense resin. Frankincense was rare and highly expensive in ancient times. Its high demand made it a symbol of luxury and wealth, especially in Europe, and it contributed significantly to the prosperity of the Arabian Peninsula. Frankincense is also important in Buddhism and Hinduism, where it is often used in meditation to create a sense of calm, clarity of mind and spiritual insight. Over the past two decades, scientific studies have increasingly supported the health benefits of frankincense . (Related: Reviving the ancient healing wisdom of frankincense Boswellia .) With its warm, woody scent, frankincense can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or taken as a supplement – offering a range of scientifically backed therapeutic effects . Frankincense helps treat arthritis Frankincense has been used for centuries to treat inflammation-related conditions, including arthritis. The key compounds in frankincense, such as alpha- and beta-boswellic acid , along with other plant chemicals (other pentacyclic triterpenic acids), work by blocking processes in the body that lead to inflammation – particularly through 5-lipo- and cyclo-oxygenase pathways. A 2014 study in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage showed that when osteoarthritic mice were treated with oral or topical boswellic acid, there was a reduction in both cartilage loss and inflammation of the joint lining. In humans, the findings in a study in the BMC Nutrition Journal suggest that frankincense could help ease the symptoms of both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In a 2018 review of Seminars on Arthritis and Rheumatism , frankincense was found to be consistently better at reducing pain and improving joint mobility in osteoarthritis patients. However, it was noted that the overall quality of many of the studies was not particularly high – highlighting the need for further, more robust research. Another study in Phytotherapy Research followed participants who took 169.33 mg of Boswellia extract twice daily for 120 days. The results showed reduced inflammation, joint pain and stiffness in those with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis and no significant side effects were reported. Additionally, research from the Journal of Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Electrodiagnosis revealed that applying frankincense oil to the skin for six weeks helped reduce osteoarthritis pain. A 2018 study in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies reported that taking 350 mg of curcuminoids alongside 150 mg of boswellic acid three times daily for 12 weeks led to significant reductions in osteoarthritis pain. Another study showed that taking 5.0 grams of methylsulfonylmethane and 7.2 mg of boswellic acid daily for 60 days resulted in greater improvements in pain and joint function compared to a commonly used osteoarthritis supplement, glucosamine sulfate. Frankincense helps improve gut function A 2017 study in the Journal of Research in Medical Sciences found that when combined with other herbal remedies, frankincense has been found to ease abdominal pain and bloating and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Additionally, research in Minerva Gastroenterology showed that taking 250 mg of Boswellia tablets daily for six months led to improvements in IBS symptoms. This resin seems especially effective for conditions like ulcerative colitis, which is a significant inflammatory gut issue. In another study in the European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences , participants with mild ulcerative colitis in remission who took Boswellia extract daily for four weeks experienced symptom improvement. The extract also demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in rats with colitis. However. it is important to note that many of these studies were small or not conducted in humans, so further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions. Frankincense helps reduce asthma symptoms Active compounds in frankincense, particularly terpenes, work by preventing the production of leukotrienes, which are chemicals that cause bronchial muscles to tighten during an asthma attack. Additionally, frankincense may influence Th2 cytokines, which can lead to inflammation and excess mucus production in asthma patients. In a small study in the European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences , participants who took 500 mg of Boswellia extract daily alongside their standard asthma treatment found they needed to use their inhalers less frequently over four weeks. Another study in Phytotherapy Research demonstrated that a supplement combining 200 mg of frankincense with the South Asian fruit bael ( Aegle marmelos ) was more effective than a placebo in reducing asthma symptoms. Frankincense helps improve oral health A test-tube study found that boswellic acid in frankincense extract was effective against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , a bacterium known to cause aggressive gum disease. Additionally, a very small study in the Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology involved participants chewing gum containing frankincense for five hours. Saliva samples collected during the study showed a decrease in microbial counts over time – suggesting that frankincense may help reduce sources of infection in the mouth . While these findings are promising, further research is necessary to fully understand the impact of frankincense on oral health. Frankincense may have anticancer effects Test tube studies in the Journal of Translational Medicine indicate that the boswellic acids in frankincense might prevent the spread of cancer . A research review in Postepy Higieny also suggests that boswellic acids could inhibit DNA formation in cancerous cells, which may limit cancer growth. Preliminary test tube research indicates that frankincense may be effective against various types of cancer , including breast, colon, pancreatic, prostate and skin cancers. Additionally, it might help ease some some effects associated with cancer treatments. In a study in the Journal of Neurological Sciences , which involved patients undergoing treatment for brain tumors, those who took 4,500 mg of boswellic acid extract daily experienced a reduction in brain edema (fluid buildup in the brain) while also being able to lower their regular medication dosage.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-entire-field-alzheimers-research-exposed-as-fraudulent.html,Entire field of Alzheimer’s research exposed as FRAUDULENT – longstanding NIH neurology director Eliezer Masliah engaged in data manipulation to benefit drug companies,"A third-party investigation by Science has uncovered significant levels of fraud in the Alzheimer research community . The investigation has confirmed research misconduct by Eliezer Masliah, a longstanding employee of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and a leading figure in neurological studies. The allegations involve the falsification of scientific data, specifically the reuse and relabeling of images in his published papers to artificially boost the efficacy of Alzheimer's drugs. Masliah, who was appointed as the director of the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) Division of Neuroscience in 2016, has been a pivotal player in the field, overseeing a budget of $2.6 billion. Celebrated for his contributions to the understanding of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, Masliah has authored nearly 800 research papers, making him one of the most cited scientists in his discipline. This research has led to the speedy approval of new Alzheimer’s drugs, but now these drugs are being called into question. Academic investigation detects intentional data manipulation in Masliah’s research over 25 years The investigation into Masliah’s work has called into question numerous Alzheimer’s studies from his laboratory at the NIA and at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). This work contained manipulated images, including Western blots and brain tissue micrographs. An independent forensic analysis presented a 300-page dossier, revealing a pattern of questionable data across 132 published papers spanning from 1997 to 2023. The scrutiny of Masliah’s work began in 2023 when forensic image analysts began flagging discrepancies in several of Masliah’s papers on PubPeer, an online platform for discussing research publications and allegations of misconduct. The initial concerns prompted a deeper examination by a team of experts, including Columbia University neurobiologist Matthew Schrag, neurobiologist Mu Yang, and independent forensic analyst Kevin Patrick. Their previous investigation into another researcher led to significant findings, including the suspension of a clinical trial due to data manipulation. In their analysis of Masliah’s work, Schrag, Yang, and Patrick uncovered numerous instances of duplicated and altered images across multiple studies. Yang noted that certain Western blots appeared to be “seamlessly blended,” suggesting a deliberate effort to misrepresent data. She described her investigative process as akin to that of an art historian, identifying a “signature style” of manipulation that recurred in many of Masliah's papers. One particular study published in 2015 in BMC Neuroscience illustrated troubling image manipulation that exaggerated the drug's effectiveness. In this research, images of brain tissue from normal and mutant mice suggested that prasinezumab reduced tau damage, but further analysis revealed unnaturally similar images that raised doubts about their authenticity. As Yang and her team reviewed Masliah’s publications, they identified hundreds of suspect images, leading them to halt their search due to the overwhelming evidence of misconduct. “I suspect similar problems would emerge from a close examination of the hundreds of other Masliah papers,” Yang commented. The allegations raised serious concerns among neuroscientists. Samuel Gandy, a neurologist at the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, expressed his shock, stating, “Hundreds of images. There had to have been ongoing manipulation for years.” Drug companies and scientists who benefited from fraudulent Alzheimer’s research now called into question Following the dossier's release, the NIH stated that Masliah's misconduct was confirmed in two publications, leading to his removal from the NIA’s neuroscience division director position . Details regarding his current employment status remain unclear, as NIH officials declined to elaborate on their next course of action. The implications of these findings extend beyond Masliah’s individual work. This fraud has also exposed the research of the late Edward Rockenstein, a former UC San Diego neuroscientist who co-authored 91 papers that now face scrutiny due to the dossier's findings. Similarly, Robert Rissman, who contributed to 16 papers cited in the dossier, is now at USC, where the institution has announced a confidential review of his involvement with Masliah’s work. Masliah’s research has influenced the development of experimental drugs, including prasinezumab, which was aimed at treating Parkinson’s by targeting the alpha-synuclein protein linked to the disease. However, recent clinical trials reported no significant benefits, raising further questions about the validity of the underlying research. Masliah played a pivotal role in the drug’s conceptualization alongside the late Dale Schenk, who co-founded the biopharma company Prothena. The drug’s efficacy is now under scrutiny due to Masliah’s questionable research. Even with Alzheimer’s research fraud uncovered, the FDA has declined to comment on the implications for the drug prasinezumab, which is currently undergoing a new phase 2 trial aimed at assessing its effectiveness in slowing the progression of Parkinson’s-related movement difficulties. The phase 2 trial of prasinezumab is particularly critical, as drug makers Hoffmann-La Roche and Prothena look to announce preliminary results later this year. These companies are ignoring the latest findings of fraud, and are expected to make decisions regarding a possible phase 3 trial by 2025 or 2026. The ongoing concerns about Masliah’s research not only challenge prasinezumab but also jeopardize the credibility of various other drug development efforts that rely on his earlier fraudulent research methods and data manipulations. One of those drugs, built on the fraud of Masliah’s research, is Cerebrolysin , sold by Ever Pharma. Masliah’s fraudulent research will also impact Neuropore Therapies, which cites Masliah’s work as foundational for its Parkinson’s therapies. NIH officials and their research collaborators have committed data fraud to benefit drug companies for many years now, and the Alzheimer’s research community is collapsing as a result. Decades have passed, as Alzheimer's patients suffer without any real answers, while the NIH committed data fraud to benefit themselves and their drug company friends.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-forever-chemicals-found-band-aids-womens-underwear.html,REPORT: Forever chemicals found in BAND-AIDS and WOMEN’S UNDERWEAR can seep into the body and may contribute to cancer and infertility,"If you think mass population reduction through planned inflicted sickness and the sale of toxic products is a “conspiracy theory” then you better think again. If you’re not already familiar with forever chemicals, they’re used to make hundreds of products consumers use regularly, including cookware, food wrappers and bandages. Now it’s revealed they’re found in products that seep directly into the bloodstream and body fluids, causing cancer and infertility. Got an open wound you want to cover to keep it safe from infection? Don’t use Band-Aids or Curad, because a shocking report reveals many of their bandages contain fluorine, a primary component of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances also known as forever chemicals), that raise one’s risk of thyroid cancer by 55 percent or more. The chemicals seep directly into the blood through the wound, doing the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do, which is protect the body from infection and disease. By the way, fluorine is used to make rocket fuel, so don’t think the manufacturers of these bandages don’t know better than to use it in their products. Welcome to the Cancer Industrial Complex of America and the insidious infertility drive, brought to you by Big Pharma and the genocidal maniacs at the U.S. regulatory agencies that approve all these hazardous products. PFAS chemicals are very dangerous when inhaled, can burn skin and damage eyes, so why are they commonly found in bandages and women’s underwear? The former head of the National Toxicology Program, Dr. Linda Birnhaum, a seasoned toxicologist, is on the record saying that the fact that these toxic chemicals are coming in direct contact with open wounds is “troubling.” Once in the bloodstream, they lodge in healthy tissue and damage the immune system, the kidneys, the liver and other vital organs. Health watchdogs tested over 40 bandages from 18 different brands and found fluorine in more than half of them. This testing was done in an EPA-certified lab and found HIGH LEVELS of the forever chemicals in the adhesive flaps and in the absorbent pads of bandages sold at the most popular of retailers, including Amazon, Rite Aid, Target, Walmart and CVS. Remember, parents put these bandages on their children and babies too. Millions of menstrual products and women’s underpants manufactured with toxic PFAS that can cause cancer and infertility Here is another blatant attack on reproductive health exposed by truth news. It’s now revealed that millions of products women use on their private parts are causing cancer and infertility. We’re talking about panties, panty liners, sanitary pads, tampons, and incontinence pads revealed through multiple in-depth lab analyses conducted over the past 4 years to contain forever chemicals. One company, Thinx , had to settle a class-action lawsuit for $4 million just to keep the findings under wraps, so the general public wouldn’t catch wind of the fertility issues caused by their adulterated products . Fluorine was detected in nearly half of their feminine products. Dr Birnbaum commented: “Dermal exposure to PFAS from your menstrual products can be a big problem. Because vaginal skin is so vascular, we can anticipate the internal exposure could be a bit worse.” If you are a consumer who “follows the science” when it comes to health and safety, then this arena of products should greatly concern you. Check every product you use for forever chemicals like PFAS and choose wisely, from now on. Tune that internet dial to WomensHealth.news for more great insight into chemicals in the food, medicine and personal care product supply that affects the health of women and children across this nation and the world.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-malone-recounts-rally-against-replicon-injections-japan.html,"Dr. Robert Malone recounts 30,000-strong rally against replicon injections in Japan: “They call it the third atomic bomb”","Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology inventor Dr. Robert Malone recounted a rally against self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) vaccines that happened during his recent trip to Japan. He shared the details of the rally during the ""Rescue the Republic"" event, held on Sept. 29 in the District of Columbia. According to Malone, the aforementioned gathering in the Land of the Rising Sun saw 30,000 people speak out against sa-mRNA or replicon injections. ""I just came back from Tokyo where they had a 30,000-person rally because they're about to deploy self-replicating RNA vaccines. Japan is being used as the guinea pigs for the world for this new technology. The Japanese people are calling this the third atomic bomb,"" Malone told attendees of the Washington, D.C. event. (Related: How Japan plans to destroy the world with new ""self-amplifying"" RNA ""vaccine."" ) Malone said the replicon vaccine named ARCT-154, ostensibly for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), was the product of the collaboration between three companies – San Diego-based Arcturus Therapeutics, Melbourne-based CSL and Tokyo-based Meiji Seika Pharma (MSP). The sa-mRNA COVID-19 injection developed by Arcturus and CSL and distributed by MSP – the two firms' exclusive Japanese partner – received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare last November. ""[The November 2023] approval marks a historic and exciting milestone as the first sa-mRNA vaccine in the world to be registered, and supports CSL's promise to protect global health,"" Dr. Jonathan Edelman, CSL senior vice president for vaccines innovation, said in a statement. ""We are committed to working with health authorities around the world to ensure this important vaccine technology will be available to people at risk for COVID-19."" Meanwhile, Arcturus CEO Joseph Payne said: ""This approval for the sa-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a major achievement. We are excited to embark on future endeavors that utilize our innovative sa-mRNA vaccine platform alongside our global exclusive partner, CSL."" Malone: MSP CEO threatens to go after critics of replicon injections Malone continued by sharing that the CEO of MSP threatened to go after those critical of the so-called replicon vaccine, even though the Japanese drug maker has no idea about the extent to which its mRNA COVID-19 injection will replicate. He said: ""Now the CEO of the Japanese company recently gave a press conference. What did he say? He said anybody that is spreading misinformation, we're going to go after [them] legally, we're going to try to have them jailed if [the critics] say anything against their [sa-mRNA] vaccine technology that's never been rigorously tested. ""We don’t know if it's going to infect other people. We don’t know if it's going to spread. We know its going to replicate. We don't know if it's going to get into the brain of the elders in Japan. But we do know that if we say anything about these concerns, the CEO is going to come after us and try to put us in jail. That's the new world order. That’s what we're coming into. That’s what they want to implement on us. ""They want to shut us down. They want to prevent us from speaking. They want to completely control the narrative and they want to be able to deploy psychological warfare on all of you to control you, to train you, to respond to the fear narratives about avian influenza and monkeypox and whatever it is they want to deploy next in order to control you, in order to teach you to shut up, sit down, stay in your homes, and do what you're told.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-fauci-protected-eha-peter-daszak-federal-scrutiny.html,Fauci protected EcoHealth Alliance and its head Peter Daszak from federal scrutiny,"Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci reportedly shielded EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) and its head Peter Daszak from scrutiny by the U.S. federal government. The Defender disclosed this revelation involving the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It cited hundreds of documents, such as emails obtained under Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, congressional subpoena and congressional interview transcripts, to back up the report. Based on the trove of evidence, the NIAID under Fauci protected the EHA from federal scrutiny – ensuring the organization led by Daszak continues to receive public money without the need to turn over key data. According to the Defender , EHA ""collaborated on novel coronavirus discovery and engineering projects"" with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China's central Hubei province. When news of a novel coronavirus – which would later become the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) – first circulated, EHA was among the first grantees the NIAID under Fauci got in touch with. Daszak was among the invitees when the institute began conducting weekly calls with a few experts about COVID-19 in early February 2020. In the summer of that year, a report said EHA maintained the goodwill of NIAID. This was manifested in the form of two grants awarded to the organization totaling $19.8 million. In a Nov. 18, 2021 email, Fauci's advisor David Morens wrote that his boss ""asked how Peter is doing, as he often does, and he seemed to commiserate with him to a degree."" Despite evidence of EHA and NIAID's close ties, Fauci brazenly dismissed Daszak and his group as ""minor and rogue grantees"" at a congressional hearing this summer. Daszak's group continued to receive funding thanks to allies within NIAID Morens' November 2021 email came at a time when officials at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suspended EHA's existing NIAID grant. The NIH also sought lab notebooks and unpublished genomic data as a condition to restore EHA's funding. The information demanded of the group could have shed light on the coronavirus research in Wuhan before the pandemic. But according to sources, millions continued to flow to EHA thanks to the help of Daszak's allies within NIAID. Some of these allies were also instrumental in approving his coronavirus research in the first place. One such example is gain-of-function research which can enhance the transmissibility of a pathogen. ""Daszak would not ask his longtime collaborators in Wuhan for information sought by the U.S. government until … January 2022, two years after the pandemic began,"" the Defender mentioned. It added that most of the NIAID employees who helped Daszak maintain funding amid the pandemic still retain positions of influence at the institute. Fauci stepped down as NIAID director and retired from public sector in December 2022. Meanwhile, Morens and his NIAID colleague Jeffery Taubenberger wrote an op-ed in defense of EHA. The piece referred to people concerned about gain-of-function research as ""luddites"" and ""the complaining crowd."" But more than four years after the pandemic began, the Department of Health and Human Services – the NIH's parent agency – initiated debarment proceedings against EHA and Daszak. The agency cited problems uncovered by government officials outside NIAID and the House COVID-19 Select Subcommittee as a reason for the debarment. According to the Defender , Daszak has expressed his intention to contest the move. Head over to FauciTruth.com for similar stories. Watch this video of Fox News' Sean Hannity discussing U.S. Sen.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-pomegranates-timeless-superfruit-with-surprising-health-benefits.html,Pomegranates: The timeless superfruit with surprising health benefits,"Pomegranates, an ancient fruit with jewel-like seeds and tangy-sweet juice, has graced not only our tables but also sacred scriptures and timeless literature – think of its role in the rich tapestry of stories from the Bible to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" But beyond their historical significance and culinary delights, pomegranates are emerging as a powerhouse in the realm of health. Recent scientific research, including a groundbreaking study in Advanced Biomedical Research , reveals that these vibrant fruits pack a serious punch when it comes to promoting overall well-being. With a unique blend of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial compounds , pomegranates are not just a delicious treat. They may also hold the key to enhancing your health in remarkable ways. Heart health Pomegranates may boost heart health by reducing inflammation and lower blood pressure. The fruit juice is rich in antioxidants and polyphenols, particularly punicalagins. These compounds help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow, which can lead to lower blood pressure and reduced strain on the heart. A review of clinical trials published in Pharmacological Research found that participants who drank pomegranate juice experienced significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure . Additionally, another study in Phytotherapy Research noted that individuals with heart disease who consumed pomegranate juice reported less chest pain and showed improved markers of heart health . Blood sugar control Pomegranates can be beneficial for people with diabetes, but moderation is key due to their natural sugar content. These superfruits are high in potassium and natural sugars. While the sugars can impact blood sugar levels, the antioxidants in pomegranates may help improve glucose control . Some studies published in Antioxidants indicate that moderate consumption of pomegranates can improve fasting blood sugar levels in people with diabetes . However, those with kidney disease should consult their doctor or healthcare provider, as the potassium content may require caution. Skin health Pomegranates may promote healthier skin and protect against premature aging, These superfruits are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation – key contributors to skin aging. Vitamin C also plays a crucial role in collagen production which is essential in maintaining skin elasticity. Some studies suggest that pomegranate extract can improve skin hydration, elasticity and overall appearance . Additionally, it may protect against ultraviolet-induced damage – helping to prevent skin cancer. Endurance Pomegranate extracts may enhance exercise performance and endurance. The polyphenols in pomegranates, especially nitrate and punicalagins, are vital compounds that can increase nitric oxide production in the body – leading to better blood flow to muscles during exercise. This helps improve endurance and reduces muscle damage. A study published in Nutrients found that trained cyclists who consumed pomegranate extract could exercise longer before feeling exhausted . The extract also appeared to aid in muscle recovery. Additionally, the unique pomegranate extract used in the study was shown to improve blood flow and exercise performance due to its rich polyphenol content. Oral health Pomegranates may contribute to better oral health. The antibacterial properties of pomegranate extracts can help fight harmful bacteria in the mouth – reducing the risk of gum disease and dental plaque formation. A study published in Ancient Science of Life found that pomegranate mouthwash effectively reduced oral bacteria and improved gum health in individuals with gingivitis. Cancer Pomegranates may have protective effects against certain types of cancer. The fruit contains several bioactive compounds, including ellagitannins and flavonoids – compounds that have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, reduce inflammation and influence key pathways involved in cancer progression. Preliminary research published in Molecules suggests that pomegranates could help prevent or enhance the treatment of various cancers , including breast, colon, lung, prostate and skin cancers. Studies indicate that compounds in pomegranates may down-regulate genes involved in DNA damage and disrupt pathways that allow cancer cells to thrive. Brain health Pomegranates may improve memory and cognitive function, particularly in older adults. The fruit juice is rich in ellagitannin polyphenols. These antioxidants protect nerve cells from oxidative damage – potentially improving memory and cognitive abilities. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that middle-aged and older adults who drank eight ounces of pomegranate juice daily for a year performed better on memory tests than those who drank a placebo juice. Animal studies have also shown that pomegranate juice can protect against brain injuries caused by oxidative stress. Digestive health Pomegranates promote digestive health, thanks to their high fiber content and anti-inflammatory properties. The dietary fiber of this ancient fruit helps regulate digestion, while the antioxidants reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. A study published in Anaerobe showed that mice consuming pomegranate extract developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at a significantly lower rate than those that didn't. This suggests that pomegranates could have a protective effect on gut health . Weight management Pomegranates may assist in weight management and fat reduction. The fiber content helps promote a feeling of fullness, while the antioxidants enhance metabolic processes and fat breakdown. Some studies published in Food Science & Nutrition suggest that the polyphenols in pomegranates can influence fat metabolism and reduce body fat percentage – making it a beneficial addition to weight loss diets. Urinary health Pomegranates may help support urinary health, particularly concerning kidney stones. While some studies suggest that pomegranate juice can help prevent the formation of kidney stones, experts at the National Kidney Foundation warn that evidence is mixed and the exact mechanisms remain unclear . Animal studies published in Urolithiasis indicate that pomegranate juice may contribute to urinary health, but further research is needed to fully understand its effects on kidney stone formation in humans.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-ken-paxton-suing-big-pharma-illegal-pricing-insulin.html,"Texas AG Ken Paxton SUING Big Pharma for illegal scheme that jacked up insulin prices by 1,000%","Key players within the pharmaceutical industry are conspiring with one another to artificially inflate the price of insulin by more than 1,000 percent, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing them to try to stop it. In a statement, Paxton revealed that Big Pharma is attempting to take full advantage of diabetes patients by driving up insulin prices as high as they possibly can, money and lots of it being the ""cure"" for the pharmaceutical industry's insatiable greed problem. ""This is a disturbing conspiracy by which pharmaceutical companies were intentionally and artificially inflating the price of insulin,"" Paxton tweeted. ""Big Pharma insulin manufacturers and PBMs worked together to take advantage of diabetes patients and drive prices as high as they could."" ""These companies acted illegally and unethically to enrich themselves, and we will hold them accountable."" (Related: Did you know that insulin injections more than double the risk of death in type 2 diabetics?) What about COVID jabs? Paxton specifically called out pharmacy benefit managers, including Eli Lilly, Express Scripts and CVS Pharmacy, as the co-conspirators in this insulin racket, which will price many diabetics out of their medicine. ""Through this conspiracy, the manufacturers artificially and willingly raised the prices of insulin then [sic] paid a significant, undisclosed portion back to the PBMs as a quid pro quo for inclusion in the PBMs' standard offerings,"" he says. ""The PBMs then granted preferred status to the manufacturer whose drug has the highest list price while excluding lower priced drugs. These synthetic insulin drugs, which today cost the manufacturers less than $2 to produce and were originally priced at $20 when released in the late 1990s, now range between $300 and $700."" According to Paxton, what these pharmaceutical giants are doing violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, constitutes unjust enrichment, and represents an unlawful civil conspiracy. ""While the PBM Defendants represent that they perform their services on behalf of their clients (including Texas payors) and diabetics to lower drug prices, increase access to affordable drugs, and promote diabetic health, these representations are false,"" the defendants in Paxton's case argue in their defense. ""Rather, the PBM Defendants have worked in coordination with the Manufacturer Defendants to distort the market for diabetic treatments to their benefit at the expense of Texas diabetics and payors."" Paxton remains painfully silent about the damage the pharmaceutical industry caused to humanity with its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines."" Some are wondering if he plans to go after them, too, once he gets done with this lawsuit. ""When you have time, sue the hell out of Moderna for their one hit wonder myocarditis epidemic gene therapy vaccine,"" wrote one person on X / Twitter. ""7.7% of the recipients of the gift that keeps on giving have had their lives changed forever thanks to false assertions of safe and effective."" Another called on Paxton to take a closer look at the root causes of diabetes and address those rather than just make a big deal about the cost of treating the symptoms. ""Now look towards the question as to why we have the health problem to begin with,"" this user said. ""We can't keep slapping bandaids on everything."" The Health Ranger gave a shoutout to Paxton calling what he is doing to fight insulin price gouging ""Outstanding!"" ""All of these companies need to be held accountable for their corruption,"" wrote another. ""We recently paid about $12 for a topical rosacea skin medicine in eastern Europe,"" told another about how much cheaper drugs are overseas compared to here in the U.S. ""Identical med brand formula and manufacturer costs well over $110 here in the U.S. No generic available in U.S. Medicare only covers this in a foam, not the gel.

""We were called 'conspiracy theorists.'"" Others noted that there are many more than just 120 victims of Diddy who have not yet come forward – or, possibly, who are no longer alive since being violated by Diddy and his entourage. ""If even half of this is true, it's going to blow Hollywood wide open,"" another said. ""The era of silence had better come to an end."" ""Let's see if he survives longer than Epstein,"" wrote another, referring to Diddy. ""We've waited a long time for that client list – what are the odds we get the Diddy list?"" In Rugg's opinion, Diddy ""seemed more reckless than Epstein,"" so perhaps something will really happen this time around to hold these perverts accountable for their crimes against humanity, including underage humanity. ""Epstein's clients were also more powerful (hence why the FBI doesn't seem to care about getting to the bottom of it),"" Rugg added on X / Twitter. ""This is why people have been deleting their social media posts,"" said another. The entertainment industry is crawling with deviant perverts who deserve severe punishment for their sex crimes.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-sermon-045-black-mulberries-gods-nutritional-powerhouse.html,Sermon 45: Mike Adams talks about BLACK MULBERRIES as God’s nutritional powerhouse,"Bible nutrition educator Mike Adams discussed black mulberries as God's nutritional powerhouse during his 45th sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. While the mulberry tree is mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments, those mentions do not pertain to health, nutrition or anointing. One such mention can be found in the Gospel of St. Luke : ""[Jesus] replied: 'If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.'"" (Luke 17:6) According to the Health Ranger, the verse's message centered on a person who has faith being able to do the impossible. He then turned to the mulberry tree, noting that it grows very fast. While some species produce fruit in the first year, the majority of trees in the Morus family (where mulberries belong) usually produce fruit in the second year and beyond. Adams continued that wealth grows on trees, and that mulberries are wealth since the tree produces not only food but medicine. Black mulberry is high in nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin B2 and vitamin B6 and elements like iron, copper, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and sodium. It is also rich in antioxidants like flavonoids and anthocyanins. A study published July 2021 in the Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences cited by the Health Ranger expounded on the nutritional constituents of mulberry. ""Mulberries or its extracts exhibit excellent antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects, and is used to combat different acute and chronic diseases,"" the paper stated. (Related: Mulberry: The ancient “tree of life” loaded with health-promoting and therapeutic properties .) The study continued that different parts of the Morus species ""like fruits, leaves, twigs and bark exhibit strong antityrosinase inhibition activity that makes it a suitable candidate in cosmetic industries as a whitening agent."" It also mentioned the use of the mulberry fruit as a natural medicine to strengthen the joints, lower blood pressure, treat fever, protect against liver damage, and assist in urine discharge. Anthocyanins in mulberries are protective molecules for the human body ""One of the most notable types of medicine that mulberries contain is in the category of anthocyanins, which have incredible protective properties in the human body,"" said the Brighteon.com and Natural News founder. ""The anthocyanins are responsible for the dark pigment molecules that infuse the mulberry itself."" The mulberry fruit is a concentrated source of anthocyanins, in particular the compounds cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and cyanidin-2-rutinoside (C3R). These two plant compounds can be used in the food industry as natural colorants and food preservatives. But Adams continued that both C3G and C3R can be used to treat skin disorders resulting from hyperpigmentation. Aside from anthocyanins, mulberries contain important alkaloids that stimulate the immune system and safeguard the human body against pathogens. These alkaloids in mulberries activate macrophages, white blood cells that engulf and digest disease-causing cells. Mulberries also contain oleic acid, palmitic acid and linolenic acid. Citing the book ""Herbs of the Bible"" by Dr. James A. Duke, Adams said the mulberry tree's root and bark are used as laxatives. The mulberry root is also used to treat painful menstruation, while the mulberry leaves are used to treat conjunctivitis. The nutritious, anthocyanin-rich mulberry fruit is used to quench thirst, reduce fever and cool the blood. Black mulberry juice boiled in honey serves as an ointment to treat throat tumors.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-06-trans-to-serve-sentence-in-male-prison.html,Right where he belongs: Transgender rapist to serve sentence in a male prison after going on trial as a female,"A 35-year-old man attacked and raped a woman after a night out in England. He later identified as a transgender woman, but this did not help the rapist avoid male prison as only men can commit rape under British law. Alexander Secker of Lowbourne was living as a man when he attacked an intoxicated woman in Blunsdon, Wiltshire on April 23, 2023. Secker was charged under the same name but later changed his gender identification as a transgender woman and started using the name Lexi Secker. Swindon Crown Court was told the accused would be tried as a woman. Court officials addressed Secker as ""Ms. Secker"" and ""she"" although only men can commit rape under United Kingdom law, which describes the act as an offense of penile penetration. He was later found guilty of one count of rape in June and has since been sentenced to 6.5 years in jail with male inmates. Wiltshire Police faced criticism last month after refusing to specify the defendant's biological sex. A police statement in June said ""at the time of the offense Secker was living as a man"" and the crime was ""recorded as being committed by a male."" But the statement also said Secker went on trial ""as a woman"" and referred to the rapist as ""a person."" ""This person is a man. Why don't the police say so? Do they think they have to pretend because he now says he's a woman, even though he has committed the ultimate male crime of rape?"" asked Fiona McAnena of the charity Sex Matters. ""It is very concerning to see the police pandering to the feelings of trans-identifying males. It does not give confidence that they are policing without fear or favor."" Transgender rapist from Scotland initially sent to a female prison but later moved to a male jail Meanwhile, a transgender woman now named Isla Bryson of Scotland, who was convicted of raping two women when she was a man was first sent to a female prison to await sentencing. Bryson was found guilty in 2023 of committing the rapes when she was still known as Adam Graham, a ""muscular"" man with a shaved head and a face tattoo. Bryson denied the charges, telling the high court of Glasgow that she ""would never hurt another human being."" The defendant first appeared in court as Graham and was referred to as such in a 2020 court indictment. It was later that year, according to British press reports, that she decided to transition. Telling jurors that Graham was already dead, Bryson claimed she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29 years old. He has been taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment. She was initially held at Cornton Vale women's prison but was later sent to a male prison , the HMP Edinburgh. This came after then-Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that Bryson would not be allowed to serve her sentence at the women's prison. (Related: Transgender inmate charged with rape while in custody at a women's facility .) Back then, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation aimed at making it easier for people to change their legally recognized sex, but Sturgeon said the changes did not play any part in the Bryson case.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-dementia-type3-diabetes-alzheimers-triggered-insulin-resistance-brain.html,TYPE 3 DIABETES EPIDEMIC: Most nations call dementia “Type 3 Diabetes” as science reveals Alzheimer’s gets triggered by insulin resistance in the brain,"In America, most medical doctors make no attempt to cure diseases and disorders, but rather prescribe toxic pharmaceutical medications that only “manage” the symptoms of much deeper-rooted health issues that are not only curable, but preventable too. For example, it’s difficult to find a medical doctor who will blame Type 2 Diabetes on bad diet, including high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), bleached foods, processed oils, baked goods and trans fats. All these junk-science food-stuff products can also cause leaky gut syndrome, which can lead to leaky brain syndrome , where tiny sacs in the brain (vesicles) leak dopamine and you wind up with malfunctioning neurotransmitters that are clogged up with plaque. Science reveals that anyone suffering from Type 2 Diabetes is a high-end candidate for developing dementia, also known as Type 3 Diabetes (everywhere except in America). Science shows that insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor dysfunction in the brain can cause dementia Type 2 Diabetes has been scientifically linked to Alzheimer’s Disease, as insulin resistance in the brain can act as a trigger for neurological disorders, including dementia. How? Over the long term, untreated diabetes (meaning no change in bad diet) causes damage to blood vessels, including vessels in the brain . Without proper diagnosis of this, damage is likely to keep increasing, causing chemical imbalances in the brain while high blood sugar levels exacerbate chronic inflammation, permanently damaging brain cells. Vascular dementia is a stand-alone diagnosis and a warning sign that diabetes is developing into an overlap with Alzheimer’s disease (T3D). As the science of this process becomes more certain, statistics show that people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have up to a 90 percent higher chance of developing Alzheimer’s or some other form of dementia, including vascular dementia. This is revealed by a study conducted in 2016 of more than 100,000 people living with dementia, where females with T2D were shown to have a higher chance of developing vascular dementia than males. Some of the known causes of vascular dementia include hypertension (high blood pressure) and obesity. Realize that the Covid “vaccines,” also referred to as “clot shots” because the spike proteins clot and clog the vascular system, causing heart and brain issues, could be contributing to this vascular disease and disorder known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D). Symptoms of T3D include memory loss (as noticed with daily social interactions), sudden personality and mood swings, frequent bad judgment calls, difficulty completing familiar tasks and misplacing things often. This is congruent with millions of people now suffering Spike Protein Syndrome from the Fauci Flu jabs. Certain brain imaging studies may reveal indicators, signs and symptoms of T3D , including MRI scans, CT scans and examination of cerebrospinal fluid. If you or a loved one believe you are suffering from T3D, have a doctor test for signs immediately, and be sure to closely examine your regular food intake and begin eliminating junk-science food stuff, GMOs, fluoridated water, canola oil, HFCS and other corporate-made killers like soda, candy, aspartame and even mercury in vaccines (think multi-dose flu shot here). Although crooked Western Medicine is not about preventing or curing any kinds of disease or disorder, you can take steps to do this yourself. Never trust Google or YouTube to have the answers, because those are controlled and manipulated to keep you and your loved ones in the dark about health and wellness information. Tune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on toxic foods, chemical medicines and dirty vaccines that contribute to leaky gut syndrome, CNS disorders, diabetes and dementia. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-britain-chief-medical-officer-overstated-dangers-covid.html,"Britain’s chief medical officer admits government “overstated” dangers of COVID-19, causing too many people to lock themselves in their homes","Chief Medical Officer for England Sir Chris Whitty has admitted in an inquiry regarding the United Kingdom's response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that the government "" overstated the dangers of COVID ."" The COVID Inquiry was launched by former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, noting that the government's actions during the pandemic need to be put ""under the microscope."" During testimony before the COVID Inquiry, Whitty discussed how the government early on in the pandemic struggled to properly communicate the dangers associated with COVID-19 . He claimed that the balance in communicating the correct ""level of concern"" to the public was ""really hard."" (Related: British cardiologist: There could be 50,000 people in the U.K. with MYOCARDITIS due to COVID-19 vaccines .) ""I was worried at the beginning. I still worry, actually in retrospect, about whether we got the level of concern right,"" said Whitty. ""Were we either overpitching it so that people were incredibly afraid of something where in fact, their actuarial risk was low, or we were not pitching it enough and therefore people didn't realize the risk they were walking into."" ""I think that balance is really hard, and arguably, some people would say we, if anything, overdid it, rather than under at the beginning,"" continued Whitty. ""There's certainly a range of opinions on that."" ""Confusion"" caused people with COVID-19 to not seek medical attention Whitty was confronted with the British government's sloganeering during the early stages of the pandemic that people needed to ""stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."" The COVID Inquiry noted that the government's emphasis on telling people to stay at home did not come with clarifications that health services were ""open"" and that people who suspected that they had COVID-19 should seek help with the closest National Health Service (NHS) facility. The COVID Inquiry noted that this messaging resulted in fewer patients seeking Accident and Emergency services or calling 999 – the U.K.'s emergency number. Whitty admitted this shortcoming of the government – that he and his colleagues were unable to make it clear to the British public that the NHS was open for use – and criticized the ""confusion"" that caused people to avoid seeking medical care. He claimed that there was ""never going to be a perfect balance"" regarding the government's messaging regarding staying at home and seeking help with the NHS. However, he admitted that ""we didn't get it across well enough"" that people should continue to come to the hospital if they believed they needed help. ""I am confident what we didn't do was to identify over and over again that the NHS was open, in particular, if there's an urgent and life-threatening situation, you must go to (the) hospital,"" said Whitty, citing data indicating that fewer people in certain emergencies – including people with heart attacks – sought NHS assistance.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-eating-apples-daily-best-defense-chronic-diseases.html,Why eating apples daily is your best defense against chronic diseases,"In the Hebrew Bible, the apple is famously referred to as the ""forbidden fruit of knowledge of good and evil"" from the Garden of Eden. But over time, the apple took on more positive meanings. Its pleasant scent, round (sometimes heart) shape and sweet flavor came to represent beauty, hope for abundance and sweetness . Apples are a type of deciduous tree. They grow well in temperate climates. Their fruits drop from the tree when ripe, with their leaves shedding at the end of the growing season and regrowing at the next. The apple's sturdiness is seen as a symbol of growth and strength. Throughout history, the apple has often been viewed as a symbol of desire and love. The ancient Romans associated it with Venus, their Goddess of Love. Interestingly, when you slice an apple across the middle, its seeds form a five-point star, which some say mirrors the human figure – with five fingers, five senses and five main parts of the body (two arms, two legs and the head). Drawing from the findings of a study published in the Journal of Food Science , this article explores current significant phytochemical constituents in apples – together with their bioactive actions against chronic (long-term) diseases. Apples contain a variety of important bioactive compounds that contribute to their health benefits. These include macronutrients such as healthy fats, fiber (like pectin) and natural sugars, as well as organic acids like malic acid. Apples are also rich in essential vitamins like B6 (pyridoxine), C (ascorbic acid) and E, minerals such as calcium, magnesium, nitrogen and potassium and trace elements such as copper, iron, manganese and zinc. Over the past 30 years, research has highlighted the presence of specific polyphenols in apples – compounds like anthocyanins, dihydroxychalcones, flavanols (such as catechin, epicatechin and proanthocyanidins), flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids. These substances have complex chemical structures that have been linked to various health-promoting properties. An apple a day keeps the doctor away The saying ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"" is rooted in the wide range of health benefits linked to eating apples. Scientific studies – in laboratory settings (in vitro), animal studies (in vivo) and some clinical trials – support the claim. Numerous observational studies have also found a strong link between regular apple consumption and a reduced risk of developing chronic diseases or experiencing serious outcomes, or dying, from them. Apple helps manage inflammation and oxidative stress Inflammation and oxidative stress are deeply connected and often work together in the body. While they play important roles in protecting and repairing cells, when they get out of control, they can speed up the progression of chronic diseases, such as aging, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation is fueled by the overproduction of harmful molecules and is made worse when the body's natural defenses are weakened. Boosting the body's antioxidants can help calm inflammation . Similarly, oxidative stress can trigger certain signals in the body that promote inflammation – creating a cycle where the two processes feed into each other. Reducing either oxidative stress or inflammation often helps reduce the other, which is why many treatments target both issues. Apple's natural polyphenols have been shown to help manage both inflammation and oxidative stress. Studies on both animals and humans suggest that these compounds can reduce inflammation. Additionally, research on fish (grass carp) has shown that apple's polyphenols can help reduce gut inflammation by blocking specific signaling pathways related to inflammation and decreasing certain genes that contribute to the inflammatory process. Apple promotes gut health Certain compounds in apples, like proanthocyanidins and the fiber called pectin, have been shown to interact with gut bacteria. For example, studies have found that apple procyanidins can alter the gut's bacterial composition – reducing the ratio of Firmucutes to Bacteriodetes and increasing beneficial bacteria like Akkermansia . This change has been linked to preventing obesity in animal studies. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effect of apples, especially when it comes to conditions like metabolic syndrome, is thought to be related to how these compounds influence the gut microbiome. Pectin, in particular, has been shown to boost the levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , a type of bacteria in the colon that has powerful anti-inflammatory properties. (Related: Apples contain about 100 million bacteria, but organic apples are still food for gut health and the environment .) Apple against Type 2 diabetes and obesity Studies have shown that adding apples to the diet of diabetic or obese animals, as well as in lab experiments, can improve key markers of diabetes. These positive effects are mainly due to the polyphenols found in apples. These compounds promote the development of beige fat cells in white fat tissue, which helps the body burn more fat effectively. Other benefits include blocking the activity of enzymes that raise blood sugar, lowering oxidative stress and inflammation and reducing high blood sugar and insulin resistance. In large human studies involving nearly 200,000 participants, those who consumed more apples, blueberries or grapes were found to have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Since obesity is a major risk for Type 2 diabetes, apples, which are a low-glycemic fruit, can also help manage weight gain. This is due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as their influence on important cellular processes that regulate metabolism. Apple against cancer Apple flavonoids, polyphenols and polysaccharides have shown promise in helping to manage colorectal cancer. In studies using a rat model of cancer, a specific type of apple anthocyanin called cyanidin-3-O-galactoside was found to reduce early signs of cancer development. These beneficial effects are thought to occur through several mechanisms, including stopping the cell cycle (which prevents cancer cells from dividing), inhibiting the spread of cancer cells , triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis), blocking the formation of new blood vessels (anti-angiogenesis), reducing inflammation and providing antioxidant support. Another compound found in apples called phloretin has also shown potential as an anticancer agent. Research has indicated that it may be effective against various types of cancer, including blood, breast, cervical, esophageal, gastric lung and prostate cancers. Apple helps prevent cardiovascular diseases Research has shown that dietary flavonoids, which are abundant in apples are linked to a lower risk of dying from heart-related issues. This supports the idea that regularly consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risks of conditions like atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, etc. Studies have found that apple consumption can improve blood vessel function lower harmful cholesterol levels and even reduce bone mass index in clinical trials. These findings highlight the potential of apples in promoting heart health. Visit Fruits.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-first-do-no-pharm-big-pharma-corruption.html,‘First Do No Pharm’: New documentary exposes Big Pharma corruption,"“ First Do No Pharm ,” a documentary that premiered Sept. 23 in London’s Odeon theater, takes a deep dive into how pharmaceutical corporations unethically influence medical journals and regulatory agencies in ways that harm patients — while generating profits for themselves. (Article by Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) Dr. Aseem Malhotra , the U.K.-based cardiologist behind the film, told The Defender , “It’s a real eye-opener for people in the mainstream.” The documentary included commentary from international doctors and public figures including Vandana Shiva, Ph.D. , Dr. Satish Gupta, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Kim Witczak , Jay Naidoo , Calley Means and others. Malhotra said the film has received great reviews so far because it shows viewers the root of the problem but also offers solutions. The two-hour film is available for download for roughly $10. ‘Regulators can’t be taking money from Pharma’ Malhotra is a world-renowned expert in the prevention, diagnosis and management of heart disease. In the film, he explains how he grew critical of the practice of widely prescribing statins — drugs that lower a person’s cholesterol — when he noticed his patients reported side effects at a higher rate than what the medical literature reported. His observations suggested roughly 1 in 5 patients who took statins had muscle pain and fatigue, while the published literature said the risk was closer to 1 in every 100. When Malhotra and other doctors wrote articles about the issue in The BMJ , the pharmaceutical industry called for the articles’ retraction and encouraged news outlets to depict doctors critical of statins as propaganda spreaders. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies selling statins — including Pfizer, the maker of Lipitor — refused to release the raw data that they claimed showed only 1% of patients experienced side effects. Lipitor is considered one of the most successful selling drugs of all time , according to Drugs.com. At the end of 2022, it had an aggregated lifetime sales of $172 billion U.S. dollars . According to Malhotra, “medical knowledge is under commercial control — but most doctors don’t know that,” which is why the problem has persisted for so long. “Most doctors don’t even realize that the research that they use to make [decisions] is often, if not mostly, unreliable and potentially harmful — purely for the purpose of making money for these industries,” he said. The solution, he said, is to correct the commercial distortion of scientific evidence by eliminating conflicts of interest. “Regulators can’t be taking money from Pharma .” Medical journals are “massively conflicted if they’re taking millions of dollars for reprints of articles from drug industry-sponsored trials — which are basically non-transparent data.” So that needs to stop, too. “Those are the key low-hanging fruit, which I don’t think anybody is going to be able to disagree with.” The film also addresses lifestyle changes — which some viewers may “find surprising,” Malhotra said — that are most effective in curbing heart disease. Drugs need to be tested by independent scientists “ First Do No Pharm ” also reveals how Merck in the late 1990s attempted to sell Vioxx — a painkiller drug it claimed caused fewer gastrointestinal problems than over-the-counter painkillers — even when its internal scientists knew the drug could cause deadly heart attacks and strokes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 approved Vioxx but later issued a public health advisory about the drug. In 2004, Merck withdrew it from the market. Malhotra discussed his film — and how the pharmaceutical industry has captured regulatory agencies — with medical commentator John Campbell, Ph.D., during Campbell’s recent YouTube show . Given the drug industry’s track record of deceiving the public to maximize industry profits, Malhotra told Campbell that drug companies should be allowed to develop drugs — but they shouldn’t be the ones testing them. The film highlights how millions of people were killed when the pharmaceutical industry hid data on the harmful effects of their products. He said drugs should be “independently evaluated by scientists who have the rigor to do these sorts of analyses … who are not connected to industry.” ‘They do not want anyone to see this film’ Big-name celebrity figures who attended the premier event — including Australian actress and singer Holly Candy , TV presenter Jenny Powell and British TV presenter and tennis player Annabel Croft — haven’t been able to share the film on social media. “If they’re sharing posts of just being at the movie event at the Odeon, it’s being taken down by Facebook saying it breaches community guidelines,” Malhotra said. “It’s absolutely shocking.” Malhotra told The Defender that Meta — the company that owns Facebook and Instagram — has an algorithm designed to remove or shadow-ban anything that goes against the commercial interests of its sponsors or partners. He encouraged people to share the film as much as possible on other platforms, such as X, and not be discouraged. “It’s a backhanded compliment … they do not want anyone to see this film.” Watch Campbell and Malhotra discuss ‘First Do No Pharm’: Read more at: ChildrensHealthDefense.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-sermon-022-how-detox-using-gods-molecules.html,Sermon 22: Mike Adams explains how to DETOX using God’s molecules,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams explained why it is important to detoxify using God's molecules and how to do it on his 22nd sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. He said God's molecules are present on Earth through Mother Nature – particularly in the form of superfoods like plants, herbs and foods that possess amazing and miraculous nutrients. These molecules, he added, form what he calls the ""Molecular Armor of God"" as elaborated in the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians (Ephesians 6:10-17), which protects people against Satan's molecules. Mainstream science acknowledges the protective properties of these molecules – with some of them being neuroprotective (shielding the brain and the rest of the nervous system), hepatoprotective (protecting the liver) and cardioprotective (protecting the heart and the circulatory system). ""Many of them have antioxidant function. For example, they're called antioxidants, all kinds of alkaloids , all kinds of amazing nutrients,"" the Bible nutrition educator said. ""So all of God's molecules protect and support healthy biological function – whether that's at the cellular level, the organ level or the organ system level. They protect, support and enhance your biological function."" (Related: Detoxify - Nutrients that help the body eliminate toxins .) In contrast, Adams explained that Satan's molecules are exactly the opposite of God's molecules. Examples of these satanic molecules that are mostly synthesized by mankind include synthetic pesticides or herbicides like glyphosate and atrazine. ""They disrupt [and] they interfere with normal human biological function. That causes destruction and disease, rather than health and abundance."" Adams: WATER washes away Satan's molecules from the body One way to detoxify the body from Satan's molecules is through water, a chemical solvent ubiquitous on Earth. According to the Health Ranger, water can be absorbed and put into solutions that wash away toxic chemicals. The founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com stated that the act of bathing washes away toxins off the surface of the human body. Sweating, meanwhile, pushes the toxins in the skin toward the surface. Thus, sweating followed by bathing serves as a kind of baptism that removes the ""sin"" of Satan's molecules. Adams also mentioned that while other molecules can be therapeutic at low doses, they can be toxic at high doses. He cited the apricot fruit, whose kernels contain laetrile (vitamin B17), as an example. While laetrile is known for its cytotoxic properties, i.e. selectively killing cancer cells in the body, it can be toxic in huge amounts and can even kill a person. ""Natural medicines must be administered under the shepherding of someone who is familiar with these medicines, familiar with the proper doses, and has wisdom and experience in knowing how to treat patients using these natural substances,"" he stressed. Moreover, the Bible nutrition educator described cancer as the satanic expression of the lack of organized division at the cellular level. He also described modern pharmaceutical medicine as rooted almost entirely in Satan's molecules. But the Health Ranger notably mentioned ivermectin, which comes from soil microbes, as an exception. ""It's still the same molecule as the soil microbes. So ivermectin is actually medicine. I would not put that in the category of Satan's molecules. It's very therapeutic.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-beneficial-effects-grapes-cognitive-function-mental-health.html,Food for the brain: Beneficial effects of grapes on cognitive function and mental health,"Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that the antioxidants and polyphenols in grapes may have beneficial effects on the brain, particularly when consumed consistently over time. In the systemic review of RCTs assessing the effects of dietary grape interventions on cognitive function, eight studies that involved nearly 480 participants were examined to determine whether grapes or grape-based products could positively impact brain health. Two studies involved healthy young adults; one focused on healthy mothers; two included healthy older adults; and three examined older adults with mild cognitive impairment. The studies took place across different countries: three in England, three in the U.S., one in Italy and one that spanned Canada and France. The majority of the participants were women, ranging from 33 to 100 percent across the studies. The trials also assessed a wide range of cognitive and mental health outcomes – from memory and language skills to mood and anxiety. Grapes and cognitive function A review of epidemiological studies and RCTs assessing grapes and their derivatives has found encouraging results in tests that measured executive function, memory, verbal skills and perception. Executive function. This domain involves higher-level cognitive skills, like decision-making, problem-solving and task-switching. Two studies showed that grape intervention significantly improved these functions. For example, participants in one study were quicker to switch between tasks after consuming grapes – outperforming the placebo group at both two and four hours after consumption. However, one study did not report results for this domain. In another study, those who consumed grapes demonstrated better accuracy and control in a driving test. Memory. This was the primary focus of all eight studies, which used different tests to measure various types of memory, including non-verbal, verbal, working memory and more. Four studies reported significant improvements in memory after grape consumption , especially among participants with mild cognitive impairment. One standout example comes from Krikorian et al., where participants showed better neurocognitive performance and reduced interference in memory tasks after four months of drinking grape juice. However, two studies found no noticeable effect on memory and the remaining two produced mixed results depending on the specific memory test used. Verbal skills. Of the four studies that looked at language and verbal skills, one reported improvements after both short- and long-term grape interventions. Another trial found that chronic grape consumption (over three months) improved the participants' verbal skills – both compared to their baseline performance and the placebo group. Two studies, however, did not find any effect in this domain. Perception. In four studies that examined perception (the ability to interpret and organize sensory information), the results were more varied. Two studies demonstrated improvements, especially in attention tasks, but one showed similar gains in the placebo group. For instance, Bell et al. found that participants improved their attention scores in an attention network test after a grape intervention but the placebo group showed similar improvements – casting some doubt on the results. Grapes and mental health Several studies also explored how grapes might affect anxiety, depression and mood. A total of seven studies measured these mental health outcomes, but the results were mixed. Mood and calmness. One study found that participants reported feeling calmer just 20 minutes after consuming grapes. However, five studies found no significant impact on mood symptoms, including anxiety and depression, following both short- and long-term grape interventions. Depression and anxiety. The most notable mental health improvements were reported in a three-month study that focused on older adults. Using well-established tools like the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Beck Depression Inventory, researchers found that participants in the grape intervention group had reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to those in the placebo group. While there is evidence to suggest that grapes may support brain health, they are not a cure-all solution. Consuming grapes or grape-based supplements must complement other healthy habits to promote long-term cognitive well-being. Read more stories about grapes and other superfoods at SuperFood.news .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-04-covid-vaccine-intentional-effort-at-world-genocide.html,The COVID “vaccine” is an intentional effort at world genocide,"Never before have there been massive excess deaths following vaccination. (Article republished from PaulCraigRoberts.org ) Never before have there been children, young adults, athletes in their prime, entertainers, dropping dead “cause unknown” following vaccination. Of course, the cause is known. The leading doctors and medical scientists of our time–which excludes health agency bureaucrats, such as Fauci, who serve as marketing agents for Big Pharma and corrupt, politicized state medical boards and HMOs–have explained why and how the mRNA “vaccines,” which are not vaccines, kill, destroy the immune system, and cause health injuries. What is not known is why some die immediately after receiving the deadly substance, others a month later, and others remain, so far, alive. Some researchers think the content of the “vaccines” differed by lot, and some think some of the jabs were placebos for the purpose of producing an uninjured cadre to tout the safety of the jabs. Professor Michel Chossudovsky has collected here — https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-covid-killer-vaccine-people-are-dying-all-over-the-world-its-a-criminal-undertaking/5800358 — a number of videos documenting the widespread sufferings and deaths of the vaccinated. It is not the unvaccinated who are “mysteriously” dropping dead all over the world. It is the vaccinated. Yet the coverup continues. The western media–a collection of whores–are at work covering up for themselves as well as for Fauci, Biden, Bill Gates, Big Pharma, the FDA, NIH, CDC, and the utterly corrupt and irresponsible medical profession. Big Pharma and the FDA continue to push jabbing babies with the killer vaccine, and there are still parents so utterly stupid and insouciant that they participate in the murder of their own children. With people all over the world so stupid and so blindly trusting of authority, we can see why the Satanic Bill Gates and Satanic Klaus Schwab are confident that they can succeed in reducing the world population and effecting their Great Reset. What do I mean when I say Gates and Schwab are Satanic? Think about it this way. From time to time when discussing the subject, someone will say that people can be so awful they can understand why some would want to genocide them. I ask them if they would be willing to push the genocide button, and they say “no.” They understand that they have no right to cause people’s deaths in behalf of their opinion or a climate or ideological agenda. The difference between them and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab is that Gates and Schwab are willing and eager to push the genocide button. What is so horrifying is that this willingness has acquired a high moral position. Exterminating people has become the way to save the planet. The perpetrators of this mass murder are confident that their crime is too huge to be recognized as such. Naive populations simply won’t believe that “their” governments would do this to them. No one wants to admit that they executed their own family members and their own children by blindly trusting “authorities” who had announced their genocide agenda in advance. In the United States only a tiny percentage of the people have any idea what is happening. The time and energy of the population is used up in making ends meet and in entertaining themselves. They fall for one transparent crime after another. Whatever government announces they accept–President John Kennedy’s assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy’s assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin, 9/11, Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, Covid pandemic, “safe and effective” Covid vaccine. They never learn. Now they face genocide, and they still haven’t learned. The perpetrators of mass genocide are still in control. If it is not genocide, tell me what it is when distinguished medical scientists warm in advance about the mRNA “vaccine” and are censored and punished, when the inventor of the PCR “Covid test” states that the test does not indicate the presence of the virus and is ignored, when the evidence of the harmful effects of the “vaccine” are kept secret by Pfizer and the FDA, when medical doctors are prevented from treating Covid with known cures Ivermectin and HCQ, when pharmacies refuse to fill doctors’ prescriptions for the cures, when illegal and unconstitutional mandates are used to force citizens under threat of loss of job to submit to being injected, when no official attention is paid to the massive increase in excess deaths among the vaccinated, when the media carries on a deceptive campaign of lies and propaganda? Americans–indeed the world–are faced with a monstrous criminal enterprise. Do they have the strength and intelligence to recognize it? Are they going to do anything about it?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-vaccine-makers-could-finally-lose-liability-protections.html,"Vaccine makers could FINALLY lose liability protections, subjecting them to lawsuits for their injurious products","The 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which gave liability protections to vaccine makers and allowed unsafe vaccines to remain on the market, could finally be REPEALED . Thirty Republican lawmakers co-sponsored House Bill 9828 , which ends liability protections for vaccine makers, including the COVID-19 vaccine makers. If the bill passes into law, it would be the first time in over three decades that vaccine makers would be held liable for injuries resulting from vaccines listed on the Center’s for Disease Control (CDC) childhood immunization schedule. Vaccine makers' 35-year immunity shield could be axed For 35 years, the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act allowed injurious vaccines to remain on the market, with the manufacturers immune to prosecution and jury trials. Currently, families who lose a loved one to a vaccine or witness a loved one become permanently disabled are not allowed to sue the vaccine maker or hold anyone responsible for the administration of the injurious vaccine. Instead, the Act established a no-fault compensation system for individuals injured by vaccines, allowing them to file claims with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) instead of suing manufacturers directly. Funded by a tax of 75 cents per dose, the VICP was intended to protect manufacturers from potentially crippling lawsuits. The VICP, controlled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, assigns “special masters” to each vaccine injury case. These government lawyers and industry insiders ultimately get to decide the individual claims. These special masters become the judge and the jury over each case, weeding out fraudulent claims, but also dismissing countless legitimate claims (especially autism cases) in order to protect the solvency of the compensation system and to sustain vaccine supply. In essence, this kangaroo court sets aside a small amount of compensation for a small percentage of families who experienced vaccine injury or death . This system routinely dismisses vaccine injury cases and doesn’t set aside enough money to adequately compensate families who suffered through vaccine injury. Mary Holland, CEO of CHD, criticized the 1986 law for leaving injured families with no meaningful recourse, calling the compensation program a “sham.” She highlighted the rising incidence of chronic health conditions in children, linking it to inadequate accountability for vaccine manufacturers. COVID-19 vaccine could lose liability protections previously granted under the PREP Act Not only does the new bill strip liability protections for vaccines on the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule but it also takes on liability protections currently afforded to COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act . The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which covers injuries from vaccines administered under Emergency Use Authorization, has only paid out 16 claims totaling just over $425,000, with most compensations falling below $9,000. The new law would treat these fraudulent vaccines just like any other injurious product and subject the COVID vaccine makers to civil suits as well. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder and chairman on leave of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), criticized vaccine manufacturers as ""criminal enterprises"" that have collectively paid tens of billions in criminal penalties over the past decade. Kennedy has long advocated for the elimination of liability protections for these manufacturers, asserting that the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act removed their incentive to produce safe vaccines. ""If we want safe and effective vaccines, we need to end the liability shield,"" he said. The proposed legislation has garnered support from CHD, React19, and The American Family Project. React19 founder Brianne Dressen, who suffered a serious injury from the COVID-19 vaccine while volunteering in a clinical trial, emphasized the need for an effective compensation process for those harmed . She stated in a post on X: ""It’s time for the drug companies to pick up the tab."" Sources include: ChildrensHealthDefense.org Congress.gov Congress.gov HRSA.gov TulsaToday.com ASPR.HHS.gov"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-health-authorities-concealed-vaccine-role-measles-maine.html,DECEPTION: Health authorities in Maine hid the fact that MMR vaccines caused lone case of MEASLES in the state,"Health authorities in the state of Maine reportedly deceived residents by hiding the fact that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine caused last year's lone measles case there . Documents released by the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) on Sept. 24 revealed this deception. According to the trove, the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) reported a single case of measles in May of last year. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (Maine HHS) warned on May 5, 2023 that the Maine CDC had been notified of a positive measles test — ostensibly the state's first measles case since 2019. The infected child was tested for measles, with mainstream media (MSM) quickly jumping on the development and running stories on the case. MSM outlets went to work by blaming vaccine hesitancy, with fake news network CNN blaming low vaccination rates for ""recent measles outbreaks."" Meanwhile, USA Today stressed that the best way to prevent measles is for children and babies as young as 12 months to get the MMR injection. Almost two weeks after the testing, the Maine CDC announced on May 16, 2023 that the child didn't have an infectious strain of measles. But the announcement failed to state that the child's rash was vaccine related . The Maine HHS said the child ""received a dose of measles vaccines"" and that officials at the Maine CDC were ""considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution."" The child's May 3, 2023 test results, which ICAN also obtained following a Freedom of Information Act request, revealed that the measles strain was ""consistent with vaccine strain"" – meaning the vaccine caused the child's rash symptoms. According to the World Health Organization , roughly two percent of people injected with the measles vaccines develop a rash. However, the Maine CDC did not disclose this information. (Related: Measles vaccines kill more children than the measles… and it's not even close .) Government at it again with fear-mongering Children's Health Defense (CHD) General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg told the Defender that measles ""outbreaks"" are a well-worn tactic of state and federal government agencies to churn up fears about people who choose not to vaccinate or who do so selectively. ""We have seen measles used this way over and over. Here, the narrative backfired and Maine officials swept under the rug the fact that the child's measles strain was vaccine-related,"" she said. ""Their fear is that such information would lead to more vaccine hesitancy. However, obfuscating information in this way deprives the public of crucial information about vaccine safety and effectiveness."" According to Mack Rosenberg, MSM news outlets ""immediately"" jumped on ""the fearmongering bandwagon"" before the strain type was identified. ""Yet when the true nature of this child's exposure was revealed, ranks were closed to prevent the truth from getting out,"" she continued. ""Fearmongering is formulaic: Danger, solution and vilify those who do not conform,"" said CHD Senior Scientist Karl Jablonowski. According to him, it was ""reckless fear-mongering"" to identify one case of measles in a vaccinated child and then issue a press release saying that anyone who isn't immunized against measles, or doesn’t know their immunization status, should get vaccinated. Pediatrician Dr. Liz Mumper earlier remarked that it doesn't make sense to assume the unvaccinated are to blame. According to the Defender , media reports sometimes blame the unvaccinated for recent outbreaks. ""Measles can be deadly if a child does not have access to safe water and medical care. In developed countries, fatalities from measles are very rare,"" she said. Visit MeaslesNews.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-homeless-cross-dresser-arrested-attempted-kidnap-boy.html,Homeless cross-dresser arrested in Ohio for attempting to kidnap 11-year-old boy,"A homeless cross-dresser has been arrested in Ohio for attempting to kidnap an 11-year-old boy, just days after being released following a drug arrest. Local news channel WOIO reported that on Sept. 22, a 39-year-old man named Joshua Freyermuth was arrested for trying to lure a child out of his front yard by saying, ""I need to talk to you,"" then attempting to grab the child when he refused. The boy avoided the kidnapping with the help of the family dog who attacked the aggressor. ""When he grabbed my son's arm, my dog attacked him and then he stumbled back off the stairs,"" said Zachery Thurmond, the boy's father. ""He kicked his heels off, my son said he had white high heels on, and then he took off running down the street."" Freyermuth had been arrested for drug possession on Sept. 20 but was released. In that incident, Freyermuth had been pulled over after police officers received reports of a suspect driving around attempting to speak to children , police stated. Mug shots from the arrests show Freyermuth wearing two different styles of blonde wigs and makeup. Freyermuth was arraigned on an attempted kidnapping charge in Alliance Municipal Court on Sept. 23 where he repeatedly denied attempting to kidnap the boy. ""I wasn't even there. I didn't try to kidnap anybody,"" Freyermuth told the judge, while wearing his latest blonde wig. The suspect is now being detained on a $100,000 bond for felony charges connected to attempted kidnapping and he has been ordered to have no contact with the boy. Freyermuth continues to claim innocence, suggesting that he was not even at the scene of the crime when the incident happened and was instead at a friend's house. His alibi has not been confirmed, and police are still investigating the matter. Cross-dressing suspect has caught public attention The incident has gathered significant public attention because of the suspect's status as a cross-dresser. Staying out of his car as reported by police, the man who is also known by the name ""Vicky"" can be seen wearing a blonde wig, lipstick, dress and pearl necklace in his mugshot. Neither police nor reporters have been able to determine if Freyermuth identifies as transgender or is just a cross-dresser who partakes in drag for other reasons. This is not the first case showing connections between cross-dressers and child predators. Drag Queen Story Hour, for example, has come under fire for having convicted pedophiles among its members.

(Article by Ben Bartee republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Something tells me pharmaceutical lobbyists are busy little beavers these days, working the phones to demand Brandon’s handlers snuff this little labor dispute out before they reconsider where they’ll be allocating future bribes. Via CNBC (emphasis added): “As a port strike stretching from New England to Texas halted nearly half of all trade coming into the U.S., customs data shows that critical medical devices and drug components for the booming, expensive weight-loss and diabetes drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound — are among the trade casualties in the ILA union port work stoppage … “Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both heavily reliant on the Port of Norfolk,” said William George, director of research at ImportGenius, which tracks the customs data. In the past year, Novo Nordisk has imported through Norfolk 419 twenty-foot equivalent unit, or TEU, containers worth of pharmaceuticals and injection devices that contain semaglutide , a compound in its branded weight-loss drugs, according to George. “Novo fine syringes commonly used for insulin injections come into the U.S. by ocean freight as well,” he said. Novo Nordisk has raked in nearly $50 billion in sales from Wegovy and Ozempic, with most of that revenue coming from the U.S.*, its CEO said in recent testimony before the U.S. Senate.” *$50 billion dollars extracted from the bleeding American middle-class by an offshore corporation, just like that — all to (allegedly) solve a problem that could be remedied virtually overnight if a tiny fraction of that cash pile were redirected to cleaning up the food supply and educating Americans about what these industries are doing to them instead of allowing these same industries to lie and, worse, laundering those lies through corrupted Public Health™ institutions.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-nyc-rat-birth-control-filthy-rodent-infestation.html,"New York City launches RAT BIRTH CONTROL scheme to clean up filthy, rodent-infested streets","A new trial program has commenced in New York City that aims to remediate the city's rat infestation problem using birth control pharmaceuticals. Instead of poison, the Big Apple, starting on Jan. 1, 2025, will begin placing contraceptive pellets inside special rat-accessible containers throughout the city. When the rats enter the containers and eat the pellets, it sterilizes them so they cannot reproduce. Proponents of the scheme say this is the most humane way to deal with NYC's rodent problem. ""We can't poison our way out of this,"" said city council member Shaun Abreu back in April when the initiative, known as ""Flaco's Law"" after the Eurasian eagle-owl of the same name that escaped from the Central Park Zoo last year and was later found dead with rat poison in its system, was first proposed. ""We cannot kill our way out of this,"" Abreu added in a statement. (Related: NYC is experiencing record numbers of leptospirosis cases due to the Big Apple's rat infestation problem.) PETA excited about rat birth control scheme Prior to Flaco's Law going into effect, the city spent 12 months trialing its effects on rodent populations throughout New York City's boroughs. City inspectors went around checking the traps during this time to see if the rats were eating the contraceptive pellets. ""During such monthly inspections of the pilot program areas, the department shall track the amount of rat contraceptive in each rat contraceptive dispenser,"" the bill's provisions state. As usual, a pharmaceutical company, in this case Senestech, is benefitting from the new law. The firm manufacturers a ""plant-based"" product called Contrapest that supposedly prevents rats from reproducing for 45 days, effectively reducing (or so we are told) the rodent population in a ""humane"" way without damaging people or the environment. It is no secret that NYC has a rat problem. Estimates suggest that about three million of the rodents live in the Big Apple, this according to a pest-control company called MMPC that cited a 2014 study from Jonathan Auerbach. The extremist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is celebrating Flaco's Law, claiming it to be an ""innovative approach"" to a very serious and longstanding problem. PETA praised city leaders for choosing ""birth control over cruel, lethal methods such as poison and suffocation."" Last year, the city attempted to pilot a smaller rat contraceptive program only to deem it a failure. This time, city officials are hopeful that the updated plan will reduce the city's rat problem and restore some semblance of normalcy to the lives of visitors and residents alike. ""NYC now has many restaurants with 'outdoor seating' and the rats run under customer tables and scare them,"" one commenter wrote about what dining outdoors in New York City is often like. ""Are they going to start putting birth control in cafeteria food?"" asked another, concerned about the prospect of it being this easy to lace food with contraceptives. ""The real rats are in the U.S. Congress,"" suggested another about America's even more serious rat infestation problem. What about the possibility that contraceptive-laced rat food ends up in people food? The implications of this new scheme are ominous from that perspective, don't you think? ""Is this a trial run for the people version, perhaps?"" is how one commenter put it. ""So New Yorkers eating out will still be eating poison and rat droppings,"" wrote another. ""But hey, it's too late: the rats have won."" ""Knowing the ability of rats to adapt to 'poisons,' I would imagine they will soon adapt and continue reproducing!"" said another.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-drug-cartel-using-usps-ship-abortion-pills.html,Report reveals a Mexican drug cartel is using the U.S. Postal Service to ship black market abortion pills all over America,"Catholic pro-life advocacy organization American Life League has released a report warning that Mexican drug cartels are facilitating the increased use of unauthorized and self-managed abortions by using the United States Postal Service to ship black market abortion pills all over America . The report, ""Beneath the Surface: Exposing the Abortion Pill Drug Cartel,"" was published following the League seeing reports that chemically induced abortions in the U.S. – administered by women at home through the use of drugs with the chemicals mifepristone and misoprostol – have risen since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In March 2024, the Guttmacher Institute reported that chemically induced abortions accounted for 63 percent of all abortions performed in the United States. The institute's report indicates that more than 642,000 abortions in the U.S. were performed in this manner . (Related: REPORT: 63% of all abortions in 2023 were carried out using pills .) American Life League National Director Katie Brown indicated that the ""astonishing rate"" of increased access to abortion drugs is the fault of the Food and Drug Administration , which in 2023 approved the shipping of abortifacient drugs without the need for in-person consultations. ""It's clear that the FDA has dropped the ball on this . As the government agency charged with oversight of drugs coming into this country, they have failed,"" said Brown. ""And where is the [USPS]? The post office is supposed to screen packages for illegal items, yet black market abortion drugs are being mailed into every state."" One Mexican cartel has monopolized the sale of black market abortion pills in the U.S. The League's report indicates that one Mexican cartel in particular, known as Las Libres, is responsible for the majority of the black market abortion pills being sold in the United States. According to the report, Las Libres has been freely marketing its unregulated, non-prescribed abortion drugs over the internet to unverified customers – with the drugs similarly coming from unvalidated suppliers not authorized by the FDA to sell abortifacient pills. There is no kind of oversight over the quality or purity of the drugs, nor the suitability of the recipients. Through its websites, Las Libres encourages women to use encrypted email services like Proton Mail to inquire about how to purchase abortion pills. Las Libres then sends instructions through these emails, including asking women to provide their full names and the dates of their last menstrual periods. Las Libres also states in these instruction emails that ""No other information is needed. You will receive further instructions for how to order."" In addition to advising women how to hide their online abortion pill requests, Las Libres explicitly tells these women to lie to their doctors if they end up botching their home abortions, providing guides for how to ""hide their abortion if they are experiencing excessive bleeding and need medical attention."" ""These unsupervised procedures – self-administered without continuing medical oversight – are incredibly traumatic and dangerous to women,"" said Brown. ""Even legitimately distributed abortion pills come with an FDA-boxed warning about potentially fatal infections."" ""The Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care reports that many women who have taken these drugs report extreme stress and trauma caused by expelling their dead baby's body at home , alone, after days of nausea, severe cramping and bleeding,"" continued Brown.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-compounds-in-grapes-powerful-protection-heart-disease.html,Research: Compounds in grapes offer powerful protection against heart disease,"Science finds that a key to a healthy heart could be as simple as snacking on a bowl of fresh, organically grown or freeze-dried grapes . Research reveals that compounds in grapes offer powerful protection against heart disease – the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 18 million deaths each year. Heart disease is a type of cardiovascular disease that refers to a broader range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. It impacts the heart's structure and function, with arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats that can affect how efficiently the heart pumps blood), coronary artery disease and heart failure being the most common forms. Simple dietary choices, like incorporating grapes and grape-derived products, may provide a natural way to support heart health and reduce the risk of disease and cardiovascular events like stroke. Grapes are loaded with powerful compounds that can boost heart health. According to a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences , grapes are rich in bioactive molecules called polyphenols , such as anthocyanins, flavonoids and stilbenes. These compounds are gaining attention for their impressive range of health benefits – from fighting inflammation and aging to offering protection against heart disease. Among these compounds, quercetin (a type of flavonoid) and resveratrol (a stilbene) stand out as potent antioxidants. They help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body , which may play a role in reducing the risk of heart disease by protecting the heart's cells and blood vessels from damage. Resveratrol, in particular, has been widely studied for its potential to support heart health by lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels – two key factors in preventing cardiovascular disease. Another powerful group of compounds found in grapes are the proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins. These have been shown to help lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure, which are both linked to a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes. Grapes are also packed with heart-healthy fatty acids like linoleic, linolenic and oleic acids, as well as phytosterols like beta-sitosterol. These natural compounds work by partially blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines, which helps lower the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol in the bloodstream, further reducing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries – a condition known as atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that regularly consuming grapes or using grape extracts rich in these bioactive compounds can lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure. However, it is important to note that the levels of these beneficial bioactive molecules in grapes can vary based on factors like grape variety, ripeness, how they are stored and even the way they are grown. Things like the amount of sunlight, water and care given to the vines can affect how much of these heart-protecting compounds the grapes develop. Grapes: A nutrient powerhouse Grapes are packed with essential nutrients that contribute to overall wellness. These nutrients include: Fiber . Supports digestion, lowers cholesterol and helps maintain a healthy weight — all key factors that contribute to heart health. Vitamins . Rich in vitamin C, an immune-boosting antioxidant, and vitamin K, crucial for blood clotting and bone health. Minerals . Provides potassium to help regulate blood pressure, along with smaller amounts of calcium, iron and magnesium, which support cardiovascular function. Maintaining heart health is all about prevention. While incorporating grapes and other heart-healthy foods into diets can help reduce the risk of heart disease, true protection comes from an all-around healthy lifestyle. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, combined with regular exercise and daily physical activity, quality sleep and stress management, is essential for preventing chronic conditions later in life.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-hospitals-harvesting-organs-donors-still-alive.html,Hospitals harvesting organs from donors who are STILL ALIVE,"Dr. Heidi Klessig, M.D., appeared on Children's Health Defense (CHD) TV the other day to warn people that registering to be an organ donor puts them in danger of having their organs harvested from their bodies while they are still alive. When registering to become an organ donor at the DMV, well-meaning people are told that they are ""giving the gift of life,"" but Dr. Klessig says this is a complete misnomer based on what she knows about how the process really works. ""When you go to sign up to be an organ donor, you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles and you see the brightly-colored signs saying 'give the gift of life,' you're not offered a consent form,"" she explains in the video below. ""You're never told that when you become a brain-dead organ donor, you are not biologically dead. These people have a beating heart. Their lungs are working. Their digestive system works. Their kidneys work."" As an organ donor in a hospital setting, your organs are only taken if you actually die … right? Wrong. pic.twitter.com/DSqlOAi61R — Children’s Health Defense (@ChildrensHD) September 26, 2024 (Related: Did you know that the only thing a doctor has to do to start conducting lab rat-like experiments on still-alive registered organ donors is to declare them ""brain dead."") Braindead doesn't mean dead Because of how the word sounds, braindead can make it seem like a person is pretty much already dead and ready for their organs to be harvested and given to someone else in need. The truth, though, is that being braindead does not mean that a person is actually dead. ""People who have been declared braindead have delivered healthy babies,"" Dr. Klessig says. ""These people are in no way dead."" In recent weeks, there have been two such cases of organ donors who were declared braindead before their organs were extracted for transplant. Both individuals may have been able to recover were it not for being taken advantage of, it appears, by the organ transplant industry. A 19-year-old athlete named Terrance Howard was declared braindead following a serious motor vehicle accident that left him with a terrible brain injury. Howard's parents have what Dr. Klessig describes as ""shocking and horrible"" video footage that they shared to social media begging medical professionals to help their son get better, but to no avail. The other case involves 23-year-old Jamaican business student Amber Ebanks who, following her braindead diagnosis, was neglected and left to die of starvation. Ebanks suffered some kind of injury that prompted her to drive herself to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, only to 10 days later end up actually dead with her organs harvested by the hospital. ""She had a beating heart. She had lungs that were working. She looked like every other patient in the hospital that was getting better. And her family fought for her. They wanted care for her, but they were pressured almost every other day – doctors wanted to remove her life support."" ""The organ procurement team actually showed up the very first day after her procedure, even before she was declared braindead – you know, being interested in seeing her become an organ donor, which her family refused."" If you are interested in watching the full video interview with Dr. Klessig, visit ChildrensHealthDefense.org . ""Once on, it's not easy to get off,"" someone on X wrote about becoming an organ donor. ""You can't just request it like you can to add. You can't even do it online. You fill out a form and mail it. You never hear from anyone that it was completed. Then you go to renew and tell them you're no longer a donor and they tell you computer says you are.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-consultant-urges-senate-rethink-nutritional-guidance.html,Former Big Food/Big Pharma consultant urges Senate to rethink nutritional guidance and distrust every institution,"In a powerful roundtable discussion hosted by Senator Ron Johnson, health experts issued stark warnings about the prevailing narratives surrounding nutrition and chronic diseases in the United States. The event, titled “ American Health and Nutrition: A Second Opinion, ” aimed to explore critical questions that have long been dismissed or overlooked. One of the main organizers of the event – Calley Means – urged the Senate to rethink nutritional guidance and distrust almost every institution. America’s institutions have lied to the public for decades, misleading people on nutrition, healing from chronic illness Means, a former consultant for Big Food and Big Pharma, emphasized the need for skepticism regarding the advice offered by major institutions on nutrition and chronic diseases. “Life expectancy has not increased in the past century, and we spend 90 to 95% of all medical spending on chronic issues, yet outcomes remain stagnant,” Means stated. Means highlighted alarming trends, noting, “Heart disease has risen with increased statin prescriptions. Type 2 diabetes has surged alongside metformin use, and ADHD diagnoses have also climbed as more Adderall is prescribed.” He further pointed out that rising rates of depression and suicide correlate with increased prescriptions of antidepressants, while opioid prescriptions have led to greater pain management challenges. Means criticized the American food system, describing it as “weaponized” due to the influence of the processed food industry. He traced its origins back to the tobacco industry, stating that major cigarette companies strategically acquired food brands and applied their expertise in creating addictive products. “They moved addiction specialists into their food divisions, creating ultra-processed foods designed to be both palatable and addictive,” he explained. Food chemicals such as MSG are used to addict consumers to toxic food-like products that are void of nutrition. Consumers get accustomed to eating ultra-processed foods that do not provide their cells what's necessary to carry out vital functions. Means asserted that the standard American diet has not only contributed to public health crises but has also been financially beneficial for the healthcare industry, which profits from treating the chronic conditions stemming from poor nutrition. “The medical industry has been complicit in this issue, benefiting from the rise in chronic diseases,” Means added. It’s true: most of the new drugs manufactured today do not address the root cause of chronic disease. Many of the new drugs actually cause new health problems. Ultra-processed, food-like items have replaced raw living foods and herbs that people need to thrive Max Lugavere, a best-selling author and long-time advocate for nutritional awareness , echoed these sentiments. He warned that many items in grocery stores should not be considered food but rather “food-like items” that contribute to an obesity epidemic. “This isn’t just about willpower; it’s about our food system,” Lugavere asserted. He concluded with a poignant observation: “We are not simply living longer; we are dying longer, plagued by preventable illnesses.” The discussions at the Senate roundtable were deeply distrustful of government guidelines like the USDA’s food pyramid , which ignores essential food groups such as herbs, seeds, roots, barks, berries, seaweeds and healthy fats, to name a few. As health education is dumbed down in school systems and in medical schools, there is growing concern about the effectiveness of current nutritional guidance and chronic disease management strategies. As chronic diseases surface, individuals are finding their own way out of these health struggles by researching and implementing holistic strategies that are dismissed by traditional allopathic doctors -- most of which are not trained on nutrition and herbal medicine. As the panelists called for a re-evaluation of institutional advice, they highlighted the urgent need for systemic change in America’s approach to health and nutrition. Food pantries are void of the raw, living foods, nutrient-dense superfoods , adaptogenic substances and medicinal herbs that can set people free from their chronic diseases.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-pharma-giants-proclaim-golden-age-of-vaccines.html,Pharma giants proclaim “Golden Age of Vaccines” where SYRINGES replace conventional medicine,"Pharmaceutical giants are proclaiming that the world has entered the ""golden age of vaccines,"" where syringes with experimental substances are replacing conventional medicine. Barron's published a report about the proclamation, which explains how some Big Pharma companies are developing new vaccines to treat other health issues . The industry raked in record profits from manufacturing Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines in the last few years. Drug companies were able to deliver these injections to the public in roughly a year, a fraction of the time earlier vaccines typically take. The report stated that Pfizer and Moderna received tens of billions of dollars in revenue selling their messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 injections. But four years on, sales of COVID-19 booster injections have plummeted. Moderna, whose mRNA injection for COVID-19 is its only approved product, is now scrambling to get new products on the market. (Related: FDA is still using emergency use authorization to release COVID-19 shots without meeting safety standards .) Other companies are following suit, developing injections using mRNA technology. From personalized vaccines against cancer, malaria and tuberculosis to improved flu, pneumonia and meningitis injections, pharmaceutical firms are seeking to develop these injectables and deliver them to neighborhood drugstores. French drug firm Sanofi has stated its goal of doubling its vaccine sales and becoming the industry leader in immunology by 2030, hitting €10 billion ($10.84 billion) in annual vaccine sales. It will have three to five major vaccines in final-stage trials by 2025 – including an RSV toddler vaccine, a pediatric pneumonia vaccine and an improved yellow fever vaccine. Phil Dormitzer, global head of vaccine research and development at British firm GSK, noted that his company is doing early-stage research on a gonorrhea vaccine. ""It used to be relatively easy to treat,"" he lamented. ""Now, there are more drug-resistant strains to treat."" Vaccine hesitancy poses a roadblock to Big Pharma's agenda According to Johns Hopkins University infectious disease physician and vaccine scientist Dr. Kawsar Talaat, pharmaceutical companies didn't prioritize vaccines because they tend to be less profitable than medicines that must be taken every day for years. ""[But] it has changed quite a bit in the past few years,"" she noted. Medical practitioners and researchers point out that the biggest challenge facing vaccines is no longer the science but the growing number of Americans who refuse to take them. Vaccine hesitancy exploded during the pandemic when thousands of Americans quit their jobs rather than receive COVID-19 vaccination. The report cited the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which said 92 percent of American adults were injected with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. But only about 21 percent got the booster shot given earlier this year, and roughly 14 percent have received the current booster. ""You have the meteoric rise of science for developing and producing vaccines. At the same time you have increasing skepticism and rejection of vaccines,"" Dr. Gregory Poland, who heads a vaccine team at the Mayo Clinic, told Barron's . He warned that if vaccine hesitancy rises among Americans, it could ultimately crimp vaccine development. This hesitation isn't unfounded, however, as the mRNA COVID-19 injections caused vaccine injuries in otherwise healthy people. ""If they won't take them in our society where our vaccines are produced by for-profit manufacturers, [they] aren't going to invest the roughly $1 billion it takes to go from a concept to a marketable vaccine,"" Poland remarked. As per the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group, there were 258 vaccines in development as of 2020. Jacob Thompson of Wine Press News commented on the piece, writing: ""Per usual and no surprise, it always comes down to money. Big-pharma is dying for more money , and they are looking to make major returns on investment with all these new kinds of shots they are creating.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-research-multiple-chemical-sensitivities-causing-health-problems.html,HIDDEN DANGERS: Research shows multiple chemical sensitivities are causing many health problems worldwide,"The modern world is battling many challenges, and one of the most alarming involves several chemical sensitivities linked to diseases . While it's good news that many people are now living longer, studies have also suggested that chronic disease is on the rise and that people are developing age-related health problems as they get older. Additionally, the rates of life-altering conditions like asthma, autism and others are affecting more children and adults, resulting in a worsening public health crisis. Different factors have been linked to these diseases caused by chemical exposure. But a growing body of research has also revealed that multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) are a common but often ignored contributor to chronic illness. It's concerning that people of all ages are often exposed to many harmful chemicals , especially those that have been linked to health problems in people of various ages. Chemical sensitivities affect 25% of Americans Scientists from the University of Melbourne analyzed survey results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 Americans and they found that 25 percent of Americans suffer from chemical sensitivities , which negatively affects their health. The results of the analysis were published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine . The common adverse effects linked to multiple chemical sensitivities reported in the data include asthma , autism and migraine headaches . They also reported that MCS has been linked to ""lost workdays, productivity and employment."" The research team defined multiple chemical sensitivity, as ""a medical condition characterized by adverse health effects from exposure to common chemicals and pollutants ."" These chemicals and pollutants include: Air fresheners Cleaning supplies Diesel exhaust New carpet and paint Perfume Pesticides Renovation materials Scented laundry products Unfortunately, these items are often found around the average American home. They can also be found in most workplaces and schools. With how often people are exposed to these common pollutants and chemicals just from being at home, school or work, it's hard to believe that more people aren't diagnosed with different chronic diseases. (Related: Environmental Protection Agency accused of retaliating against scientists who voiced concerns about toxic chemicals .) In another recent paper published in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health , researchers found that in an international survey of over 4,000 people, including adults from Australia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, at least 20 percent reported MCS. Additionally, more than 32 percent of the participants reported fragrant sensitivity. Out of the 4.5 percent of the sample that had autism or autism spectrum disorder, at least 60.6 percent and 75.8 percent of them had either a chemical sensitivity or fragrance sensitivity, respectively. The research team also observed a correlation between multiple chemical sensitivities and asthma and asthma-like conditions. The data suggested that the frequency of chemical sensitivity has increased by more than 300 percent in America over the past decade. It also revealed that at least 61 million people worldwide are believed to be currently affected by MCS.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-sermon-025-black-cumin-seed-gods-natural-medicine.html,Sermon 25: BLACK CUMIN SEED as God’s natural medicine,"Bible nutrition educator Mike Adams discussed the black cumin seed ( Nigella sativa ) as God's natural medicine during his 25th sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. The Health Ranger based his sermon from the book of the Prophet Isaiah in the Old Testament, which mentions black cumin as being planted as a food crop in one of its verses (Isaiah 28:25). Adams said black cumin is widely cultivated for its aromatic seeds either used whole or ground. Black seed is used in different cuisines worldwide, but more so in oriental cooking. Russians and Turks use whole black cumin for their breads, while Arabs mix it with honey as confectionery and sprinkle it on food just like pepper. Ethiopians add black cumin seeds to capsicum pepper sauces and sprinkle them on breads and cakes. In Europe, black cumin seeds are mixed with peppercorns while they are used in many drink mixes, pastries and recipes in Asia. Malaysians use the oil of black cumin seed to treat headaches, nasal ulcers , rheumatism and inflammation of the male reproductive system. In Indonesia, black cumin seeds are added to astringent medicines for abdominal disorders. Ethiopians also use black cumin seed for headaches by mixing it with melted butter, wrapping it in a cloth and sniffing it. Algerians also use black cumin by roasting it with butter for coughs and taking it with honey for colic. In the Indian Ayurvedic medicine tradition, black cumin seeds are considered a purgative adjunct and antiparasitic treatment. In Lebanon, black cumin seed extract is used for liver ailments. Arabian women also use black cumin seeds to increase lactation – with medical studies attesting to the ability of black seed oil in increasing milk production in laboratory animals. Black cumin is God's FREE NATURAL MEDICINE for humanity The Bible nutrition educator also cited the work of Dr. James A. Duke titled ""Herbs of the Bible"" that outlines black cumin seed's ability to address asthma, bronchitis, coughs, fever, flu, cancer, tumors, snake bites, cancer and stomachaches. Duke's book also cites black cumin seed's ability to purge the body of worms and parasites. (Related: Black cumin seed: The ultimate medicine from Mother Nature .) According to Adams, the black cumin seed plant contains rare molecules that serve as natural medicine. These powerful healing molecules are made from three elements – hydrogen, carbon and oxygen – that God gives free of charge to humanity. God doesn't want a corrupt system composed of insurance bureaucrats and doctors receiving bribes from Big Pharma and for-profit pharmacies to control people's health. Thus, He has provided the medicine humanity needs in the form of plants – and people only need to grow and harvest these natural cures. ""This is one of those foods and herbs that needs to be used intelligently in the proper dosage for the proper reason. You don't want to just eat endless amounts of black cumin cakes or whatever. You need to be mindful of this and respect its power and potency. But it's yet one more medicine that's put on this earth by God to help us. To help us stay well, to help us overcome disease and to distribute medicine,"" Adams said. ""It's decentralized medicine. It's a medicine that's put here on this earth essentially for free. You pay no royalties to God or Mother Nature. And if you just harvest the seeds, grow the seeds, grow the plant, and then share those seeds with others then you are multiplying God's natural medicine and helping others heal. So, this is a miracle of God's medicine and it's available to all of us right now.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-02-grapes-simple-fruit-impressive-list-health-benefits.html,Grapes: A simple fruit with an impressive list of health benefits,"Grapes have been cherished by civilizations for thousands of years. From ancient Egyptians and Greeks to modern-day tables, grapes have been enjoyed fresh from the vine, freeze-dried, pressed into juice or fermented into wine, symbolizing abundance and life. The ability of grapes to thrive in various climates – from warm Mediterranean regions to colder winters – makes them a constant presence year-round. But beyond their history and versatility, grapes are a nutritional powerhouse that offer an impressive list of health benefits. Often called ""nature's candy"" for their natural sweetness, grapes are packed with nutrients that can help protect your body from a wide range of health conditions. They contain a mix of natural phytocompounds, essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants – all of which work together to support overall health. Rich in nutrients A cup of grapes (about 151 grams) provides vitamin K (18 percent of your daily value or DV), which plays a key role in blood clotting and bone health. You'll also get a dose of vitamin C (five percent of DV), known for its immune-boosting properties and vitamin E (two percent of DV), which supports skin health and acts as an antioxidant. The B vitamins in grapes, including thiamine (B1, riboflavin (B2) and pyridoxine (B6), help your body convert food into energy, support brain health and maintain proper function of the nervous system. Grapes are also an excellent source of minerals such as copper (21 percent of DV), essential for the formation of red blood cells, potassium (six percent of DV, which helps control blood pressure and manganese (five percent of DV), crucial for bone health and metabolism. Antioxidant powerhouse One of the key reasons grapes are so beneficial for health is their high concentration of antioxidants. These naturally occurring compounds play a vital role in protecting your cells from damage caused by harmful molecules known as free radicals. When free radicals accumulate, they can lead to oxidative stress, which is linked to chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and even cancer. What makes grapes particularly remarkable is that they contain over 1,600 different plant compounds , many of which have potent antioxidant properties. These include anthocyanins, phenolic acids, polyphenols, proanthocyanidins and stilbenes – names you might not hear every day, but they are critical for keeping your body’s cells healthy. The antioxidants in grapes are largely found in their skins and seeds, which is why you often hear that red grapes (and red wine are particularly good for you. Red grapes owe their rich color to anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid that gives fruits their vibrant blue, orange, pink, red and purple hues. Grapes also contain two highly praised antioxidants – resveratrol (stilbene ) and quercetin (flavonol ). These compounds have been studied for their potential to lower blood sugar, protect against heart disease and reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. Resveratrol, in particular, has gained attention for its anti-aging properties as it helps to reduce inflammation and protect your cells from damage. Supports brain health and cognitive function A 12-week study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology involving more than 100 older adults found that a daily grape supplement of 250 mg led to notable improvements in attention, language skills and memory . In younger adults, research in the European Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that consuming 230 ml of grape juice accelerated memory-related tasks and enhanced mood within just 20 minutes. Additionally, a study in Scientific Report s suggests that resveratrol may reduce brain inflammation and help eliminate amyloid-beta peptide – a protein associated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Helps combat cancer Grapes are rich in potent antioxidants like anthocyanins, catechins and quercetin, which help combat cancer . Research has shown promising results, with a study published in Translational Oncology revealing that grape extracts can inhibit the growth and spread of human breast and colon cancer cells in lab tests and animal studies. Human trials also show encouraging outcomes. In a study published in Nutrition Journal , adults over 50 who consumed 150 to 450 grams of grapes daily for two weeks exhibited a reduction in markers associated with colon cancer risk. Further evidence highlights the benefits of polyphenol proanthocyanidins – compounds in grapes that offer protection against cancers of the bladder, cervix, liver and prostate. This was supported by findings from a 2022 study published in Foods . Another standout antioxidant, resveratrol, has demonstrated the ability to interfere with all stages of cancer development . A 2023 review published in Nutrients suggests that resveratrol, present in both red grapes and red wine, lowers the risk of cancers like breast cancer, colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma – making moderate red wine consumption a potentially protective habit. Supports heart health Research shows that grapes can support cardiovascular function in several ways . Grapes are a good source of potassium, offering about six percent of your daily needs in just one cup. Potassium is essential for regulating blood pressure; it helps relax blood vessels – allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing the strain on your heart. In addition to that, potassium helps your body get rid of excess sodium, further protecting against high blood pressure. However, balance is key; a review of 32 studies published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that both too much and too little potassium could increase blood pressure. Grapes are also rich in polyphenols that help protect against high cholesterol. Studies have shown that these compounds can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol by decreasing its absorption in the intestines. An 8-week study involving people with high cholesterol found that consuming 3 cups of red grapes daily significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels. Interestingly, white grapes didn’t have the same effect , likely because red grapes have higher concentrations of resveratrol. Reduces insulin resistance Moreover, grapes contain compounds that may enhance insulin sensitivity , A review of 29 studies published in Phytotherapy Research found that both grapes and grape supplements significantly reduced insulin resistance – partly due to resveratrol, which helps by boosting glucose receptor activity on cell membranes; enhancing insulin production; increasing insulin sensitivity; lowering insulin resistance and protecting insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Supports gut health With grapes containing 81 percent water, they are a great choice for staying hydrated and supporting regular digestion . Proper hydration helps maintain smooth bowel movements and can reduce the risk of constipation, which is often characterized by infrequent stools and a sense of incomplete evacuation. The fiber found in whole grapes is also another digestive booster. Unlike fruit juices, whole fruits like grapes are known to help alleviate constipation by speeding up the passage of stool through the digestive tract – increasing stool weight and promoting more frequent bowel movements. A study published in Frontiers in Nutritio n indicates that a higher intake of fruits like grapes can positively impact gut health by influencing gut bacteria, improving stool consistency and boosting stood frequency, which can be especially beneficial for those experiencing functional constipation. Supports eye health Grapes are packed with beneficial plant compounds that promote eye health, including provitamin A carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin and a bit of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). These nutrients work together to improve visual performance, maintain eye health and help prevent age-related eye diseases, Research published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences highlights the protective effects of resveratrol on retinal cells against ultraviolet A (UVA) light. This protection may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration – a leading cause of vision loss. Additionally, a review in Nutrients suggests that resveratrol may offer protection against eye conditions, such as cataracts, diabetic eye disease and glaucoma .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-american-dental-association-pledges-push-fluoridated-water.html,"American Dental Association DOUBLES DOWN, pledges to push fluoridated water despite courts revealing fluoride causes brain damage to children","A landmark federal court ruling recently determined that fluoride levels in U.S. drinking water pose unnecessary risks to children's IQ and cognitive development, validating what conspiracy theorists have warned about for decades. Generations of people have been poisoned through the water supply without their consent. This toxic byproduct – hexafluorosilicic acid – has been dripped into most municipal water supplies for decades. The institutions that thought they knew what was best for everyone’s dental health have instead dumbed down entire generations of people, harming their IQ and cognitive development. This widespread dumbing down of human populations helps explain the lack of critical thinking skills in the 21st century. None of these serious matters of public health seem important to institutions like the American Dental Association , however. In fact, the ADA immediately issued a statement, doubling down and defending water fluoridation. Biased and stubborn American Dental Association defends fluoridated water Some institutions, like the American Dental Association, are pushing back against the science and dismissing this federal court ruling, demanding that fluoride be considered safe for everyone , against all available evidence. The ADA, representing some 159,000 dentists across the country, posits itself as “the premier source of oral health information.” The ADA claims that they have “promoted the art and science of dentistry since 1859” while advocating for the public’s health. But the ADA aren’t thinking about the big picture with fluoride and how it is destroying the cognitive abilities of those exposed on a daily basis. Immediately after the court’s ruling, the ADA hastily wrote: The American Dental Association (ADA) remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay. The district court ruling against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health. The ADA called the ruling and the barrage of social media posts that followed “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA claims that social media users are spreading information that “is not always based on research conducted according to impartial and evidence based scientific methodology.” The ADA contends that “conclusions drawn from research are not always scientifically justifiable or without bias.” One might point out that the ADA is drawing their own biased conclusions from research that was validated in court. By ignoring the latest evidence on fluoride’s damage to children’s brains , the ADA might be guilty of spreading “pseudo-scientific information.” Will the court’s decision reduce water fluoridation practices across the U.S.? The ADA wrote that the District Court Judge did “not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” However, the ruling does require the EPA to take regulatory actions to protect future children and populations from this toxic byproduct. The EPA and CDC’s current recommendation of .7 parts per million fluoride in drinking water is now outdated and not consistent with the latest science. The ADA fails to acknowledge this reality and is therefore acting against the best interest of communities that want to protect future generations. The court’s recent decision should effectively undo the longstanding fluoride recommendations of the Environmental Protections Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These corrupt agencies contend that fluoridated water is “one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.” The CDC has historically recommended, and currently recommends, fluoride at a level that was found to be damaging to children’s brains. Public water systems have added fluoride to drinking water for more than 75 years. This was done in the name of “preventing tooth decay” although tooth decay still remains a serious health issue. This is because the ADA is too busy poisoning children's brains instead of working to eliminate added sugars from food. The real question is: Will municipal water systems across the nation begin to phase out fluoride use , in the face of opposition from American institutions that have misled the public for decades?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-vaccine-manufacturers-may-lose-immunity-to-lawsuits.html,"Manufacturers of vaccines, the most dangerous “medicine” on earth, may finally lose their “immunity” to lawsuits thanks to HR 9828","The Vaccine Industry’s near 40-year-long “immunity” to lawsuits may be finally ending, thanks to Rep. Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ), who recently introduced bill H.R. 9828, which will amend the Public Health Service Act, and finally put an end to the vaccine industry’s “get out of jail free” pass that’s allowed them to literally get away with murder by vaccine violence for decades. Vaccine manufacturers have had a liability shield since 1986, when the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was put in place, so nobody could sue these bioweapon-making scientists for injuries and deaths caused by their medical WMDs. Then, that vaccine injury non-liability luxury was even more solidified in 2005 with the PREP Act , that granted Big Pharma absolute immunity from lawsuits for products that were declared for use for “ public health emergencies ,” which could be anything the government or pharma claims fits the bill, just like with the scamdemic of Covid-19. Big Pharma & Big Gov can declare anything an “emergency” and nobody can sue the vaccine manufacturers for mass-injecting the populace with deadly mRNA prions Although vaccines don’t provide immunity to diseases like they are supposed to, vaccine manufacturers enjoy their own type of immunity to lawsuits for making deadly jabs that injure, maim, blind and kill people , including children, babies and fetuses. If everything was on the “up and up,” there would have been billions of dollars awarded to the victims of vaccine violence over the past 4 decades, and the vaccine industrial complex would most likely be bankrupt and out of business, and the manufacturers and propagators in prison for life. But that’s just not what happens in America where Western Medicine is an insidious cash cow that just keeps on steamrolling the health of Americans without any repercussions. In fact, of the 14,000 vaccine injury claims made just since the rollout of the deadly mRNA Covid-19 “emergency use” only jabs, only 16 people were compensated . That’s 0.0011 percent. The rest are still “pending review” or deemed “ineligible for compensation” due to red tape, bureaucratic semantics, or outright injustice served up by the Vaccine Czars in charge of the decision making. Mind you, nobody can take these crooks and criminals to court. No judges. No juries. Just the pharma cabal deciding if you deserve any compensation for the vaccine-induced spike-protein genocide still underway. New legislation HR 9828 would strip away the injury immunity the vaccine industrial complex and pharma cabal of crooks and criminals enjoy right now Rep. Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ) says, “ My legislation strips away current immunity provisions unfairly shielding Big Pharma from the harms caused by their products and allows those injured by vaccines to pursue a civil lawsuit in state or federal court. Big Pharma doesn’t deserve a get-out-of-jail-free card for injuries caused by their harmful vaccines.” Two programs, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) enable the vaccine-injured , and families of the vaccine-murdered, to file for compensation, but currently, the “standard of proof” that the injury came from the jabs is so ridiculous that hardly a soul can squeeze out a dime from the trillion-dollar pharma cartel. Rep. Paul A. Gosar goes on to explain the atrocities in further detail, stating “Although federal bureaucrats and Big Pharma insist that vaccines are safe, there is an unfortunate lack of science regarding the safety of vaccines. For example, a review of 12,000 scientific papers by the Institute of Medicine published in 2012 found that 98 percent of injuries studied were either caused by, or may have been caused by, a vaccine.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-japanese-experts-self-amplifying-mrna-injections-disaster.html,Japanese experts warn: “Self-amplifying” mRNA injections will trigger WORLDWIDE DISASTER,"A group of Japanese experts alongside a top lawmaker has warned against the dangers of ""self-amplifying"" mRNA injections , claiming that these will ""trigger a worldwide disaster."" Ryuhei Kawada, a member of the House of Councilors – the upper chamber of the Japanese National Diet (parliament) – convened an emergency press conference alongside the scientists. Kawada and his colleagues expressed concern about the country's upcoming launch of the so-called ""mRNA replicon vaccines,"" and reiterated that the Oct. 1 deployment of these new vaccines against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""should be halted."" ""We are addressing this press conference from the standpoint that the replicon vaccine should be halted . Therefore, we have decided to hold this emergency press conference. This self-replicating immune agent, scheduled to start regular vaccinations on Oct. 1 ought to be halted and I strongly advocate for this action,"" Kawada said. ""Additionally, we must ensure thorough investigation and verification to provide relief to mRNA vaccine victims who have suffered significant harm. This must be systematically carried out. Instead of merely discarding unused vaccines, we should facilitate research by passing them on to researchers for analysis. I intend to make these demands to the prime minister and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) . "" Dr. Seiji Kojima of Nagoya University also raised concerns about the new injections. ""The purpose of receiving vaccination is indeed to reduce the mortality rate, but ironically, the rate was five times higher after receiving the vaccine,"" he said. ""Compared to those who are unvaccinated, the mortality rate is five times higher if you get vaccinated twice."" Professor Yasufumi Murakami of Tokyo Science University expressed similar concerns, saying: ""Japan is planning a large-scale rollout of self-amplifying vaccines, which are considered hazardous materials. Japan has the potential to trigger a worldwide disaster. (Related: How Japan plans to destroy the world with new ""self-amplifying"" RNA ""vaccine."" ) ""The vaccines do not seem to be effective. They do not work. They lack efficacy. mRNA vaccines have resulted in many deaths, injuries, and victims. Despite knowing they are ineffective, their use could possibly cause significant international damage. ""There is also the possibility of person-to-person transmission. There is absolutely no need to administer it. There is no need at all. Therefore, knowing this and still administering the vaccine, I believe, is a crime."" Replicon mRNA shots can multiply unchecked and spread to others The press conference came amid Tokyo's approval of the self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from CSL and Arcturus Therapeutics. The new vaccine called ARCT-154 (Kostaive) is targeted to protect against the JN1 lineage of subvariants, which descend from the B11529 omicron strain, for adults 18 years old and up. CSL Senior Vice President and Global Regulatory Affairs Head Emmanuelle Lecomte-Brisset welcomed the approval in a statement. ""We are pleased to receive the updated approval from [the MHLW] and remain on track to distribute Kostaive in time for the October COVID-19 vaccination campaign. We look forward to introducing Kostaive in Japan as a safe, tolerable and more durable option in protecting against COVID-19,"" she wrote. The MHLW's rollout of the self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 is based on ""positive clinical data from several ARCT-154 studies, including an ongoing 16,000-subject efficacy study performed in Vietnam,"" Contagion Live reported. But the approval of the experimental vaccines has been met with a widespread backlash from Japanese scientists and medical experts, who have already been sounding the alarm about the ""traditional"" mRNA injections. Kawada and his colleagues cited a study published in Cell that touched on these so-called ""replicon"" injections . The study authors found that the mRNA in these replicon vaccines kept multiplying inside the cells. Given this, they warned that the mRNA could continue to replicate unchecked in the bodies of the vaccinated – and even shed to others via body fluids.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-scientists-uncover-pfizer-hot-lots-injured-specific-populations.html,Scientists uncover Pfizer “Hot Lots” that injured specific population groups at higher rates,"A new peer-reviewed study by scientists from Children’s Health Defense , in cooperation with researchers from Denmark and the Czech Republic, has revealed significant disparities in adverse event rates associated with specific batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Published in Science, Public Health Policy and the Law , the research highlights serious concerns about vaccine manufacturing practices, including the lack of inspection for finished vials and the absence of quality control checks for product preservation and storage. Scientists from CHD, including Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, and Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist, led the research. Analysis of 156 vaccine lots finds higher rate of vaccine injury among certain lots The study analyzed 156 different vaccine lots distributed from December 2020 to April 2022. The researchers tracked where the vaccine was manufactured and where it was distributed, and traced the lots to vaccine injuries reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). The data was not readily available and had to be obtained via Freedom of Information Act request, which was acquired by the Informed Consent Action Network . The analysis uncovered that early batches, particularly those sent to hospitals and government agencies, had higher rates of serious adverse events (SAEs). Of the 977,542 adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 455,820 (46.7%) were linked to the Pfizer vaccine. While only 29% of these reports included lot numbers, researchers were able to match 290,835 serious events to specific batches. The analysis categorized the adverse events in three categories: non-serious, serious, and those that involved death. A non-serious adverse event includes mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching), temporary discomfort or pain at the injection site, mild fever or headache, and fatigue or malaise. A non-serious adverse event indicates that unnecessary harm has been done to the individual’s body, but the issue resolved or wasn’t life threatening. In the analysis, a total of 78% of the SAEs were non-serious. A serious adverse event includes hospitalization, life-threatening situations, or disabilities. These typically include conditions like anaphylaxis, thrombosis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, severe respiratory distress, seizures, stroke and myocarditis, to name a few. In the analysis, 20% of all adverse events were serious, and 2% involved the death of the recipient. Researchers condemn the manufacturing process and lack of quality control for mRNA vaccines The researchers condemned the manufacturing process for the mRNA vaccines, saying it should have never been approved in the first place. The researchers warned that there was “extremely high” variability among vaccine lots, suggesting that there were inadequate manufacturing controls and oversight. The results of the study were corroborated by similar studies from Denmark and the Czech Republic , which also reported higher adverse event rates associated with certain batches, particularly early in the vaccination rollout. The study notes that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System is not comprehensive, and typically captures less than 1% of adverse events. This means that magnitudes of vaccine injury data were never even recorded. This could be the result of propaganda dominating the medical system and the politicization surrounding the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Doctors were told that vaccine injuries are extremely rare and are the result of “antivaxxers” spreading “vaccine misinformation.” Individuals were often pressured not to report a vaccine injury by their doctor. Many patients were shamed into believing that the vaccine injury was caused by something else. In these cases of medical gaslighting, the data goes unreported, as people suffer. Contrary to statistical expectations, states with larger populations did not show higher rates of severe injuries. Instead, states like South Dakota, Tennessee and Kentucky reported disproportionately higher rates. Were certain states politically targeted and provided with a greater quantity of ""hot lots"" and dirty vaccine batches? What kind of contaminants were concentrated in these particular “hot lots?” Was Pfizer intentionally conducting several smaller experiments with various vaccine batches within the the grander experiment of COVID-19 vaccination ? Many questions remain unanswered. Sources include: ChildrensHealthDefense.org PublicHealthPolicyJournal.com ICanDecide.org Wiley.com Wiley.com NaturalNews.com NaturalNews.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-states-threaten-aap-pushing-genital-mutilations-children.html,21 States threaten top medical group with legal action for pushing genital mutilations for children,"A coalition of 20 state attorneys general and one state legislature has warned the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that it could face legal action if it continues to advocate for medical and surgical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. AAP, the largest pediatric organization in the United States, published an article in December last year claiming that laws prohibiting transgender procedures for children with gender dysphoria constitute "" state-sanctioned medical neglect and emotional abuse ."" The article, written by Emily George, Emily C.B. Brown and Rachel Silliman Cohen, claimed that withholding so-called gender-affirming care, including surgeries and hormone treatments, is tantamount to child maltreatment . (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing… chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) However, the coalition of attorneys general argued that the guidelines put forward by the AAP are only based on ""evidence-free standards,"" particularly about the safety and reversibility of puberty blockers. The attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the Arizona Legislature, addressed outgoing AAP President Benjamin Hoffman and incoming president Susan Kressley. They warned the AAP of the potential risks of puberty blockers when followed by cross-sex hormone treatments. ""When used to suppress hormones below normal ranges during or before puberty, puberty blockers: (1) may interfere with neurocognitive development; (2) compromise bone density and may negatively affect metabolic health and weight; and (3) block normal pubertal experience and experimentation,"" the coalition wrote. ""And when puberty blocker use is followed directly by cross-sex hormone use, which is often the case, infertility and sterility is a known consequence, at least for those who began puberty blockers in early puberty."" ""Telling parents and children that puberty blockers are 'reversible' at the very least conveys assurance that no permanent harm or change will occur,"" continued the letter. ""But that claim cannot be made in the face of the unstudied and 'novel' use of puberty blockers."" The AAP has been given until Oct. 18 to respond to the information requests regarding its decision-making process on gender-affirming treatments. Another expert debunks AAP claims that gender-affirming care ""does not cause harm"" Kathleen McDeavitt, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, also debunked the claims of AAP. In January, McDeavitt published an article pointing out that assertions suggesting gender-affirming care ""does not cause harm"" and ""decreases many negative health outcomes, including rates of depression,"" are not backed by ""relevant citations."" ""Although youth GAC has the support of the professional medical community in the United States, that does not mean there is no risk of harm,"" McDeavitt wrote in response to the AAP claims. ""Systematic reviews have found the quality of evidence in this field is low, meaning the literature does not actually show, with any reasonable degree of certainty, that youth GAC decreases rates of negative mental health outcomes."" McDeavitt cited research where hormonal treatments in transgender youth did not significantly improve depression outcomes, adding that depression worsened post-treatment in some cases. She also highlighted cases in which participants in gender-affirming care research tragically took their own lives before studies concluded.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-antioxidants-in-grapes-help-reduce-cancer-risk.html,Antioxidants in grapes found to reduce cancer risk,"Recent studies have found that the antioxidants found in grapes may have anticancer properties . As the global quest for natural cancer-fighting solutions continues, there is increasing concern about the rising incidence of cancer among adolescents and young adults . Despite advancements in treatment, these methods are often costly, invasive and associated with significant adverse side effects. Fruits play a vital role in a healthy, plant-based diet. They combat inflammation and chronic conditions that lead to cancer. The shift in focus toward prevention is seen as a promising alternative. Antioxidants prevent damage to cells by neutralizing harmful molecules called free radicals. Without antioxidants, free radicals can cause DNA damage which could lead to cancer. (Related: Sermon 49: Mike Adams discusses GRAPES as God's amazing natural medicine and nutrient powerhouse .) Grapes are rich in various antioxidants – particularly phenolic compounds – which are known for their potential health benefits. Key antioxidants in grapes include anthocyanins, catechins, phenolic acids, procyanidins and resveratrol. Fresh grapes contain between 63 and 182 milligrams of these phenolic compounds per 100 grams. Most of these antioxidants are concentrated in grape skins and seeds. Anthocyanins are the predominant flavonoids in red grapes. Meanwhile, grape seed extracts have shown high concentrations of flavonoids like catechin and epicatechin, as well as phenolic acids like caffeic and gallic acids. Resveratrol, another prominent antioxidant, is mainly found in grape skins but in lower concentrations. Grape phenolic compounds and their anticancer properties Grape antioxidants, especially those found in grape seeds, have shown promising effects in fighting various types of cancer. These compounds are known as grape seed proanthocyanidins. These have been effective in laboratory studies for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells in the following ways: Breast cancer. A special grape seed extract rich in procyanidins interferes with the breast cancer cell's key growth signaling pathways – leading to a halt in cell division and growth. Colon cancer . Grape seed extracts and other grape components stop cell growth and induce cell death (apoptosis). The combination of resveratrol, with grape seed extracts enhances these effects by affecting key proteins involved in cell death and growth. Head and neck cancer. Grape seed extract causes cell cycle arrest, which means stopping cells from dividing, thus inducing cell death. This is achieved through activating processes that check for DNA damage and increasing harmful reactive oxygen species inside cells, which leads to cell death. Grape seed extract also affects key proteins that help the cancer cells move and invade other tissues. Lung cancer. In non-small-cell lung cancer, which is a common type of lung cancer, grape seed proanthocyanidins can increase proteins that promote cell death and decrease proteins that protect cancer cells. They also disrupt the mitochondria and activate certain enzymes involved in cell death. Oral cancer. Grape seed extract halts oral cancer growth and induces cell death in a dose-dependent manner, which means more grape seed extracts lead to greater effects. It also reduces the cancer cells' ability to suppress enzymes that allow cancer cells to migrate and invade other tissues. Prostate cancer. Grape seed extract can block certain enzymes that help cancer cells grow and invade healthy tissues. It also reduces the activity of proteins that promote cancer spread. Skin cancer. In melanoma, a serious skin cancer, grape seed proanthocyanidins can reduce the ability of cancer cells to invade and migrate. This effect is linked to a decrease in specific proteins that contribute to cancer cell movement. These study findings suggest that grape seed antioxidants could be a valuable addition to cancer prevention and treatment strategies – offering natural options to support health and combat various cancers.

(Article by Ben Bartee republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Via Yorktown government website (emphasis added): “ Yorktown Supervisor Ed Lachterman ordered the suspension of water fluoridation in the Town today, citing a recent federal court ruling . U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen ruled on Tuesday that the current standard for water fluoridation in the U.S., set at 0.7 mg/L, presents an “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.” The decision emphasized the potential risks to vulnerable populations, including children, leading Supervisor Lachterman to take immediate action. “In light of this federal ruling and the long-standing concerns expressed by many Yorktown residents, I have decided to suspend water fluoridation as a precautionary measure,” said Lachterman . “Our priority is the safety and well-being of our community, and we believe it is prudent to pause fluoridation to further assess its potential impacts.” Yorktown will continue to monitor guidance from federal and state agencies and act accordingly to protect public health . Yorktown’s leadership will engage with public health experts to ensure that any future decisions on water treatment practices prioritize the safety and health of all residents, particularly those identified as potentially more vulnerable to fluoridation risks.” As late as August of this year, however — less than two months ago — this same individual, Ed Lachterman, was touting the alleged miracle that is water fluoridation because a boomer dentist who lives in the town told him the CDC thinks it’s a great idea while Councilwoman Susan Siegel smeared all the townspeople who objected as “like the anti-vaccine people.” Read more at: ArmageddonProse.Substack.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-big-pharma-paid-public-health-official-tpoxx.html,Big Pharma paid off public health official to push useless TPOXX drug for monkeypox that DOESN’T WORK,"Former New York City ""Covid czar"" Dr. Jay Varma did a whole lot more bad things than just engage in wild, drug-addled sex parties during the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) ""pandemic,"" the world has recently learned. The latest news to drop from Steven Crowder, who broke the story via his ""Mug Club,"" is that Dr. Varma took cash payments from a drug company called SigaTech in exchange for pushing that company's monkeypox drug ""TPOXX"" that does not even work. In the video below, watch as Dr. Varma explains how the corporate media had a role to play in creating the ""spin"" surrounding TPOXX that SigaTech hoped would stop investors from ""dumping"" the company's ""worthless"" stock. Even though monkeypox, also known as mpox, is a gay disease that spreads through perversion, Dr. Varma's job was to help scare the general public into begging for TPOXX. ""We want the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, to approve our drug specifically for Monkeypox and right now it's only considered experimental and they won't approve it based on this study,"" Dr. Varma says in the video. ""We also need to keep up the people's belief that the [TPOXX] drug works. So, that's why spinning it in the media is helpful."" BREAKING: NYC’s Covid Orgy Kingpin Reveals He Was Hired by Pharmaceutical Company @SigaTech to Help Sell Monkeypox Drug ‘TPOXX’; Details Media “Spin” Scheme To Ensure Investors Don’t “Dump” Company’s “Worthless” Stock; Says Disease Primarily Impacting Gay Community is Not a… pic.twitter.com/TJpzVHAlRn — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) September 25, 2024 (Related: After telling New Yorkers to avoid human contact for their own ""safety,"" Dr. Varma participated in a drug-fueled orgy – because politicians are above the law.) SigaTech's biggest client is Washington Perhaps unsurprising is the fact that SigaTech's number-one customer is none other than the federal government , which purchases drugs from the company primarily for smallpox. ""They have secured hundreds of millions of dollars [sic] worth of contracts over the years,"" Crowder tweeted. As of Aug. 21, 2024, SigaTech has successfully secured not one, not two, but three separate procurement contracts for TPOXX, all of which were forged in the past three years. The Department of Defense (DOD) is paying $9 million to SigaTech as part of the deal. ""Now it appears, SIGA wants to use TPOXX to cash in on the Monkeypox hype – and according to Varma, needs the FDA to approve its Emergency use to do so even though the studies didn't turn out the way they wanted,"" Crowder warns. Since SigaTech is a publicly traded company, investors are already responding by selling the company's stock, which plunged by nearly 20 percent over the past five days since these revelations started gaining traction. Perhaps the worst thing about all this is the fact that TPOXX does not even work as claimed. It failed in trials to help patients overcome the illness, especially those with other preexisting illnesses. ""One thing we do know is that the antiviral utterly failed in people with untreated HIV and very low CD4 cells, indicating severe immunosuppression,"" tweeted Benjamin Ryan, a mainstream media health and science reporter who says SigaTech had trouble recruiting participants.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-new-zealand-court-fluoride-drinking-water-toxic.html,New Zealand court rules that even lower-level 0.7 mg/L fluoride in drinking water presents “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment”,"A federal court judge in New Zealand has ruled that water fluoridation at a decreased level of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of water is still toxic to people and the environment, creating an ""unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."" Following a long, drawn-out legal battle, plaintiffs in a case against water fluoridation successfully argued that it simply does not make sense to continue lacing public water supplies with fluoride chemicals. ""Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that water fluoridation at the level of 0.7 mg/L – the prescribed optimal level of fluoridation in the United States – presents an 'unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,'"" the judge ruled in the case. Across New Zealand, most fluoridated water supplies fluoridate at a level of 0.85 mg/L, with some councils fluoridating even higher at the top-end amount of one part per million (1 ppm) of fluoride. (Related: Did you know that fluoride does absolutely nothing to protect teeth from cavities, despite what public health authorities claim?) Drinking fluoridated water lowers one's IQ Drawing from a pool benchmark dose analysis carried out by renowned toxicologist Prof. Philipe Grandjean, who is famous for his work on mercury neurotoxicity, the judge highlighted the fact that drinking fluoridated water causes a child's IQ to drop. ""The pooled benchmark dose analysis concluded that a 1-point drop in IQ of a child is to be expected for each 0.28 mg/L of fluoride in a pregnant mother’s urine,"" the judge explained. ""This is highly concerning, because maternal urinary fluoride levels for pregnant mothers in the United States range from 0.8 mg/L at the median and 1.89 mg/L depending upon the degree of exposure."" ""Not only is there an insufficient margin between the hazard level and these exposure levels, for many, the exposure levels exceed the hazard level of 0.28 mg/L."" Other research confirmed that people who drink fluoridated water show noteworthy levels of fluoride in their urine. In New Zealand's Palmerston North, which is fully fluoridated, test subjects showed levels of fluoride in their urine at 0/82 mg/L. Mothers who drink fluoridated water while pregnant were shown to give birth to children with sustained central nervous system damage that likewise results in lowered IQ and symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and / or depression. Dr. Diana Sarfati, New Zealand's Director-General of Health, now has the option to completely call off all water fluoridation efforts across the country in order to protect the nation's citizens, and especially its children. The question remains: will she do it ? Fluoride Free New Zealand has created a petition that it is urging people to sign calling for an end to all water fluoridation in New Zealand. Be sure to check it out and sign! ""It's a good sign, but it needs to go to the top supreme court to be valid and implemented,"" tweeted someone on social media in response to the news. Others here in the United States shared Fluoride Free NZ's tweet about the court ruling with their own politicians – one this writer saw shared it with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his consideration – so perhaps they, too, will take similar action. ""They're still poisoning us with the death shots, so they're not going to stop poisoning our water,"" tweeted another with a more skeptical take on the situation. ""All those of us that stood against fluoridation were called all kinds of nasty crap,"" added Counterspin Media NZ to the conversation. ""It may have been because those that targeted us, were themselves affected by lower IQ?"" More related news about the dangers of fluoride consumption and exposure can be found at Fluoride.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-taiwan-recognize-gay-marriage-taiwanese-chinese-couples.html,"Taiwan to recognize same-sex marriages between Taiwanese and Chinese couples, sparking national security concerns","The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of Taiwan announced on Sept. 19 that same-sex Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese couples can legally register their marriages in Taiwan . Taiwan has long been at the forefront of the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement in Asia, becoming the first in the continent to legalize gay marriage in 2019 following a years-long legal battle. Taiwan MAC spokesman Liang Wen-chieh announced that the move will allow Taiwanese-Chinese same-sex couples to be subject to the same regulations governing heterosexual couples in Taiwan. These same-sex couples would first have to be legally married in one of the countries that recognize same-sex marriages. Once this is done, they must file their marriage certificates and other relevant documents to the MAC, and relevant agencies will then make contact with the couples and conduct interviews. ""Only after passing the interview on the border [at the airport and ports] can they enter the country to register their marriages,"" said Liang. ""This is our current principle for cross-strait marriages. The government upholds the principle of treating same-sex marriage and heterosexual marriage equally."" The move comes over a year after Taiwan announced it was lifting restrictions on recognizing transnational same-sex marriages , or marriages between one Taiwanese citizen and a foreigner of the same sex. The decision was made by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior 's Department of Household Registration Affairs, which stated that two people of the same sex may not be denied the right to ""establish a permanent union with intimacy and exclusiveness for the purpose of living together"" in Taiwan. Before this development, Taiwan only legally recognized same-sex marriages where both members of the partnership were from countries that also legalized same-sex marriage. National security concerns raised with Chinese citizens potentially obtaining Taiwanese IDs through gay marriage There are an estimated 360,000 Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens living in Taiwan , the vast majority of whom are in heterosexual marriages. All of these spouses have to wait six years before they can apply for citizenship in Taiwan. Concerns have been raised that many more homosexuals from China will try to obtain Taiwanese IDs through gay marriage. Same-sex marriage is currently not recognized in China. (Related: Taiwan asserts its right to defend itself and to COUNTER-ATTACK if China invades .) ""Our current regulation is that if we recognize your marriage, you can apply for residency [in Taiwan], and after completing the process, you can apply for permanent residency,"" Liang stated. But the Taiwanese spokesman said the final stage of the procedure to acquire Taiwanese IDs, homosexual Chinese spouses must cancel their household registration in China. Liang highlighted how the longer wait times have long been in place ""to prevent cross-border fake marriages and avoid problems of national security and social order .""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-13-survival-tips-prepare-for-biological-threats.html,13 Survival tips to effectively prepare for biological threats,"When faced with biological threats – whether from natural outbreaks or bioterrorism – being prepared and knowing how to respond can be crucial for survival. Each type of threat poses unique challenges, but understanding these risks and having a plan can significantly enhance your safety and survival. Biological attacks can involve two main types of agents (pathogens or toxins that can harm animals, crops or humans) – contagious and non-contagious. Some agents, such as anthrax, can survive in the environment for extended periods – increasing the risk of exposure. Notably, many biological attacks may go unrecognized for days , as the incubation period can delay symptoms. To effectively prepare for biological threats, consider the following survival tips: Stay informed Always monitor trusted sources. Regularly check official information channels for updates and guidance during emergencies. Engage with community programs that promote awareness of potential threats. Avoid misinformation; be wary of ""rumors"" and stick to reliable sources to make informed decisions. Build a survival stockpile Regularly monitor and update your essential supplies inventory – food, water, pantry, first aid and medical supplies, hygiene and sanitation, heat and lighting and communications. Create a safe zone at home Fortify your home by identifying its weaknesses and designating safe rooms that will reduce exposure risk. Keep a supply kit in your safe room. To minimize air contamination , use plastic sheeting, duct tape and towels. Install high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in your home to capture biological agents . Plan and implement quarantine and isolation If you develop symptoms or have contact with infected individuals, self-isolate immediately. Keep healthy individuals in your home separate from those showing signs of illness – using separate rooms and bathrooms if feasible. Use personal protective equipment Keep a reasonable stash of masks and other protective gear. Use N95 or N99 masks as regular surgical or reusable cloth mass may not filter all biological agents effectively. Wear gloves, eye protection and long sleeves when in contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. Use disposable, or easily washable clothing to minimize the spread of contaminants. Follow decontamination protocols Maintaining good personal hygiene and practicing proper sanitation helps reduce the risk of infections and diseases that could impact overall health. Regular hand washing, safe food handling, and keeping your living environment clean are essential practices. Wash hands more frequently, especially after being in public places or touching potentially contaminated items. Regularly clean high-tough surfaces in your home with disinfectants such as bleach solutions or alcohol-based cleaners. (Related: Safe and clean: 8 Non-toxic alternatives to common household cleaning products that contain harmful ingredients .) Boost your immunity Healthy lifestyle changes that have a major impact on your overall health and wellness include a balanced diet, daily physical activity and exercising regularly, maintaining healthy body weight, getting adequate quality sleep, getting regular health checkups, and being aware of your family's history. Be mindful of reducing and managing stress. Engage in relaxation techniques, find activities you enjoy, or do something different that refreshes your routine and energizes your life, socialize and meet new people. Establish a communication plan Keep practicing and streamlining your family communication plan that outlines how each of you will remain in touch during emergencies. Ensure everyone knows how to reach each other and keep planning for contingencies. Maintain an updated list of local emergency services, family and trusted friends who can assist in any kind of crisis.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-were-told-fraud-in-transgenderism-never-possible.html,It’s puzzling why we’re told fraud in transgenderism is never possible (Epoch Times Op-Ed),"Commentary - Fraud is a permanent part of life. There will always be people who seek illicit advantage by representing themselves as something they are not or promising to do something they don’t intend to do. No area of human life is immune: Financiers, doctors, teachers, car mechanics, plumbers, bridegrooms—there will always be frauds among them. So it’s puzzling when we are told that there is one area of human life where fraud can’t exist. (Article by John M. Ellis republished from TheEpochTimes.com ) Transgender activists tell us that if a man says he is a woman, we absolutely must believe him—always, without exception. Let’s be clear about what this means. Even if we were to accept the entirety of the transgender thesis that men can become women if they sincerely believe they are, it still doesn’t follow that every transgender claim must be accepted as genuine. To decide in principle, without scrutiny of the individual case, that not a single claim may be doubted would make transgenderism unique in human affairs. You can question anything else that someone says, but not this. Why? Is it because nobody could gain an illicit advantage by claiming to be transgender? That is clearly not so. Male felons will have a much easier life in a women’s prison. Mediocre male athletes will benefit greatly by claiming to be female—they can become world-class overnight. Predatory males gain by getting access to places of female sanctuary such as locker rooms. In all these cases, there are powerful motivations for fraud, which means that there will be fraud. Do we see compelling evidence of fraud in some transgender claims? You’d have to be blind not to. Biologically male felons have gained access to female prisons and impregnated female prisoners—that’s predatory heterosexual male, not female, behavior. Some males who have gained access to female changing rooms by claiming to be women have been reported to sit idly on a bench ogling the disrobing women and exposing themselves. Again, predatory male, not female behavior. And when biological males exploit the strength advantage of their male bodies to easily defeat female athletes, they don’t seem to be showing any fellow feeling for women—they look more like bullies exploiting their masculine strength advantage to gain athletic triumphs they could never achieve as males. Why is the transgender lobby so insistent that every single claim to be a female made by a male must be accepted as sincere? Why are we not allowed to consider the possibility of fraud, even when it’s glaringly obvious? The answer to this conundrum is probably that transgender activists know it’s hard to convince most people that a man can become a woman just by identifying as one, and so they keep up an unremitting insistence that we simply must believe. But in the grip of this overwhelming need to demand belief, they lose sight of the fact that there are bound to be cases where we—and they, too—should not believe. A public already inclined to skepticism will become even more skeptical when transgender advocates are seen to be protecting fraudsters. When transgender activists won’t acknowledge that some transgender claims may be fraudulent, they give new opportunities, and cover, to peeping toms, flashers, lechers, cheats, and bullies—the sort who have always preyed on young women and now have active assistance from the very people who want us to believe that they are uniquely compassionate and enlightened.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-confirmed-vaccine-industry-deliberately-causing-measles-outbreaks.html,CONFIRMED: The vaccine industry is deliberately CAUSING measles outbreaks,"The state of Maine reported a measles outbreak in May 2023 that we now know was caused by measles vaccines. The Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) obtained documents showing that the strain in circulation was ""consistent with vaccine strain,"" this according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the so-called ""outbreak"" was caused by the shots, it is no longer accurate to call what happened an ""outbreak."" Instead, it is another prominent example of vaccine damage gone wild. It all began on May 5, 2023, when the Maine CDC reported that a child had ""tested positive"" for measles. The corporate media immediately began running wild headlines like: • ""Measles can be serious for anyone ..."" – Maine CDC Facebook page • ""In severe cases, measles can cause pneumonia, brain swelling and death – Bangor Daily News • ""The CDC says roughly one to three of every 1,000 children infected with measles die"" – USA Today • ""Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 ... But vaccination rates in the U.S. have dropped in recent years, sparking new outbreaks – CNN • ""Anyone who is not immunized or does not know their measles immunization status should get vaccinated"" – Maine CDC press release As you can see, it was nothing but fearmongering for months on end as the media tried to blame the unvaccinated for the sick children. It turns out, though, that the child who developed a rash had been vaccinated for measles – and it was the shot that caused the child to get sick. (Related: Have you checked out our earlier report showing that measles vaccines are far more dangerous than measles itself?) Lying as an industry The Maine CDC did admit that the child had been vaccinated with one injection of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but that it was ""considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution."" It then sent a sample from the child to the national CDC for testing where it was determined that the vaccine strain had caused the infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that about two percent of all people who receive a measles injection develop a rash, known as VARI (vaccine-associated rash illness). Scientific research also warns that rashes are a side effect of the shots, and that ""testing should only be considered if exposure to the wild-type (not vaccine-strain) virus is strongly suspected,"" and yet the Maine CDC had testing done anyway. It seems as though the plan all along was to blame the unvaccinated for the ""outbreak"" even though it was obvious from the very beginning that the MMR vaccine triggered the child's rash. Lying about it, though, gives the media another chance to make the unvaccinated look bad in the eyes of the vaccinated. The Maine CDC was quick to send in the child's measles sample for testing, but took its sweet time reporting the results to the public. This was all intentional to obfuscate the truth as much as possible. Thanks to the diligent work if ICAN, all of this is now public information for anyone who cares, though of course there is no undoing the damage already done. It shows once again that the government and the media lie at every turn, especially when a pharmaceutical product is involved. Just prior to the Maine CDC's actions, the national CDC shared a marketing presentation suggesting that the perfect ""recipe"" for manufacturing more demand for vaccines is to create ""concern, anxiety, and worry,"" including by having medical experts and public health authorities ""state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes)."" Perhaps this presentation is what caused the Maine CDC to behave as it did in lying about a fake measles outbreak? More related news coverage can be found at Plague.info . "

We now know that while New Yorkers were stuck inside ""staying safe,"" Dr. Varma was accepting cash payments from a pharmaceutical company called SigaTech to push a monkeypox drug called TPOXX on New Yorkers. Dr. Varma also helped to ""spin"" the company's endeavors to prevent investors from ""dumping"" the company's ""worthless"" stock. ""We want the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, to approve our drug specifically for monkeypox and right now it's only considered experimental and they won't approve it based on this study,"" Dr. Varma explains in the video below. ""We also need to keep up the people's belief that the [TPOXX] drug works. So, that's why spinning it in the media is helpful. You can spin them [TPOXX study results] so that people won't, like, dump the stock thinking that the company is worthless."" BREAKING: NYC’s Covid Orgy Kingpin Reveals He Was Hired by Pharmaceutical Company @SigaTech to Help Sell Monkeypox Drug ‘TPOXX’; Details Media “Spin” Scheme To Ensure Investors Don’t “Dump” Company’s “Worthless” Stock; Says Disease Primarily Impacting Gay Community is Not a… pic.twitter.com/TJpzVHAlRn — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) September 25, 2024 (Related: Check out our earlier coverage to learn more about the drug-addled sexual escapades of Dr. Varma and other politicians during Covid.) Monkeypox, a gay disease The establishment tried multiple times to get monkeypox, which they rebranded as mpox, to stick, but to no avail. After Covid, the general public is done listening to the government and media lie constantly about the latest ""disease threats,"" recognizing that it is all a sham to destroy the country. Dr. Varma admitted to an undercover reporter that the risk of monkeypox is very low unless you are a homosexual deviant who engages in rampant perversion with other homosexuals. ""Honestly, in the United States, the risk [for monkeypox] is very low,"" he said. ""It's only primarily transmitted among gay men. It basically got into the sexual networks of gay men, and a lot of gay men have tons and tons of sexual partners and often don't use condoms. So as a result, it spreads more easily."" The fact that Dr. Varma would so openly admit to all of this, even not knowing that he was being recorded, is astounding. It shows a level of untouchable arrogance where the people in charge clearly feel as though they are above the law. ""I'm not a big fan of canceling people but this guy deserves everything he gets,"" wrote someone on Twitter / X about Dr. Varma. ""It is truly a case of selling his soul."" Another wrote that the time is now to completely overhaul the public health system to put an end to this type of secret corruption and perversion happening right underneath everyone's noses. ""We need a total overhaul of our health system, and we should start by getting rid of the FDA,"" this person suggested. Someone else noted that Dr. Varma is hardly an exception to an otherwise universal rule in America where politicians are easily bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry to do whatever the drug pushers tell them to do. ""This shows that government officials are paid off to push Big Pharma drugs on the American public regardless of their need or effectiveness,"" this person said. ""This guy is a piece of garbage,"" added another. ""He should lose his license."" More related news about the abomination known as public health in the United States can be found at Plague.info . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-diddy-combs-coerced-women-into-multiple-abortions.html,Democrat-supporter Sean “Diddy” Combs accused of coercing women into multiple abortions,"Renowned rapper and Democrat-supporter Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy or P. Diddy, has recently been arrested and formally charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has also been accused of forcing his girlfriends to undergo abortions . He faces a minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum life sentence if found guilty. During the hearing, Combs pled not guilty. However, he was denied bail and was sent to jail immediately while awaiting trial. Combs has been infamous for his sex and drug parties – which he called ""freak-offs"" – and abusive behavior. Critics have been questioning how he has been able to get away with all his crimes – with victims accusing him of violence and torture during the said gatherings so extreme that they have to be treated intravenously for days afterwards. But the worst of it all is the unborn children he has victimized who would never have a chance to speak up. The non-profit pro-life group Live Action published a report on the numerous women who are accusing Combs of coercing them into repeated abortions. Virginia V., Diddy's ex-girlfriend, said she became pregnant several times and that he pushed her into aborting her preborn children. ""I have this period app and it tells me when I’m ovulating and stuff and so I told him. I told him that I'm ovulating,"" she said. “So don't do it. But he just did it anyway and then I got pregnant. And he, like – okay, just get an abortion. Like, no hesitation. But this time was harder for me because I had been with him for so long and I was, like, really in love with him."" Through tears, she added, ""Part of me wanted to keep it. But he didn't want it. … I only agreed to [the abortion] because he told me to."" She also said he offered her $50,000 to abort another baby . Combs is one of the celebrities in recent years arrested for trafficking, who are also known to have forced their victims into abortions. R. Kelly and Ghislaine Maxwell, both notorious sex traffickers were also known to have coerced their victims to have abortions. (Related: Diddy indictment claims rap mogul used his power to build ""empire of sex crime."" ) Combs is a longtime supporter of the Democrats. He campaigned for former President Barack Obama and has been praised by Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Diddy supported their abortion agenda. Diddy's 11th victim surfaces as he awaits trial in jail Federal prosecutors have accused Combs of "" creating a criminal enterprise "" in which he ""abused, threatened and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct."" His 11th and latest accuser Thalia Graves, who is backed by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, claimed Combs and his bodyguard Joseph Sherman had sedated, overpowered and tied her up before recording themselves raping her and later distributing the sex tape. Combs's former girlfriend Cassie Ventura was first to blow the whistle. In a lawsuit filed last November, she alleged he had ""trapped"" her for over a decade in a ""cycle of abuse, violence and sex trafficking."" A day after the suit landed in court, both parties said they had ""amicably"" settled the case. Joi Dickerson-Neal, who said Ventura had inspired her to speak out, alleged Combs had ""intentionally drugged"" and raped her when she was a Syracuse University student in 1991 and had made her a victim of revenge porn by filming the assault. Liza Gardner accused Combs and R&B crooner Aaron Hall of plying her with drinks and forcing her to have sex with them against her will when she was 16 years old. A woman identified only as Jane Doe claimed that Combs, former Bad Boy Records president Harve Pierre and a third person had violently gang-raped her in a New York City studio when she was a 17-year-old high school student. Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones, a producer and videographer who worked on Combs's most recent album, accused the hip-hop mogul of running an illegal racketeering enterprise in which he was forced to procure drugs, solicit sex workers and tape sex acts. He also claimed Combs and actor Cuba Gooding Jr. had groped him without consent. Grace O'Marcaigh, who worked on a yacht leased by the Combs family in 2022, accused the rapper and his son, Christian ""King"" Combs, of sexual assault. She blamed them for creating an ""environment of debauchery"" with suspected sex workers and top celebrities aboard. Crystal McKinney claimed she had been drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs following a Men's Fashion Week event in 2003 when she was 22 years old. She also said he had subsequently ""blackballed"" her in the modeling world. April Lampros, who says she met Combs as a student at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology in 1994, detailed ""four terrifying sexual encounters"" through the early 2000s. Adria English, a former adult film actress who worked with Combs in the 2000s, said he had used her as a ""sexual pawn for the pleasure and financial benefit of others"" during the ""White Parties"" he hosted at his homes in New York and Miami. Dawn Richards, who once sang in two Combs-assembled groups including Danity Kane, said she had personally witnessed his violence against Ventura and that he had threatened her life. Representatives for Combs have denied the claims. CancelDemocrats.news has more stories similar to this. Sources include: LifeSiteNews.com LiveAction.org BBC.com"

He spent the entire parade seated on top of an open-topped red Ford Mustang sporting a purple T-shirt printed with the words ""Straight Not Narrow."" Since then, Nenshi has proudly supported the LGBTQ+ community as an ally. ""It really says that you don't have to be a part of a community in order to support that community,"" said Nenshi. Up until now, Nenshi has been showing his support for the LGBTQ+ community, while challenging the stance of Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's United Conservative Party on social issues. The NDP has been vocally critical of Smith's pro-family policies, particularly those that strengthen parental rights and limit access to gender-affirming care for minors. The party also criticized the new legislation that would curb ""extreme forms"" of transgender ideology, including banning minors from undergoing gender transition surgeries. Nenshi and the NDP view these stance as discriminatory and harmful to the LGBTQ+ individuals. Head over to Groomers.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-29-former-new-york-covid-czar-admits-manipulating-the-public-defrauding-the-fda.html,Former New York COVID Czar admits to manipulating the public and defrauding the FDA while participating in perverted romps,"Many of the government and public health officials who were behind the onslaught of medical tyranny and unlawful mandates since 2020 (especially the ones that flouted their own restrictions and attended orgies) knew all along that COVID-19 was a psychological operation based on mainstream media programming, medical fraud and Big Pharma capitalizing on people’s fears and sicknesses. New York City’s former senior advisor for public health, Dr. Jay Varma, was caught on camera bragging about using the media to manipulate study results to fraudulently receive emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). COVID Czar-turned pharmaceutical tycoon admits to using media spin to defraud the public and the FDA Currently the executive vice president and chief medical officer at the pharmaceutical company SIGA Technologies, Dr. Jay Varma has disclosed exactly how pharmaceutical companies manipulate the public so they can defraud the FDA and boost their stock prices. “We want the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, to approve our drug specifically for Monkeypox and right now it’s only considered experimental and they won’t approve it based on this study,” he said in an undercover video . So, “We also need to keep up the people’s belief that the [TPOXX] drug works. So, that’s why spinning it in the media is helpful,” he explained. “You can spin them [TPOXX study results] so that people – won’t like, dump the stock thinking that the company is worthless.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) eventually granted approval for their oral TPOXX (tecovirimat) treatment, marking it the first drug specifically indicated for the treatment of smallpox in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 13 kg. Following this approval, Health Canada also authorized the use of oral TPOXX for the same patient population. Under the brand name Tecovirimat-SIGA, oral TPOXX has also received approvals from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA-UK). These approvals extend its use not only for smallpox but also for monkeypox, cowpox and vaccinia complications following smallpox vaccination in both adults and children. Dr. Varma has insider knowledge on how the fraudulent approval process works for drugs and vaccines Dr. Varma knows exactly how this fraudulent drug and vaccine approval process works. As head of the public health response in NYC in 2020 and 2021, he was part of the grand deception behind the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID-19 vaccines. After locking down New York City, he attended orgies and did illicit drugs at large underground parties with others of the elite . He knows how the pharmaceutical company manipulates their own studies and misrepresents them through the media, manipulating public opinion while bolstering stocks and garnering fraudulent EUA FDA approvals . This same psychopathic game-plan is being used across the pharmaceutical sector. The media fear machine is being used for every up-and-coming disease, and is used to sell the public on new vaccines for every flu strain, COVID strain and things like monkeypox, RSV and eventually bird flu, Disease X, etc. In the undercover footage, Dr. Varma admitted that monkeypox isn’t a public health emergency, as it is being advertised. “Honestly, in the United States, the risk [for Monkeypox] is very low. It’s only primarily transmitted among gay men. It basically got into the sexual networks of gay men, and a lot of gay men have tons and tons of sexual partners and often don’t use condoms. So as a result, it spreads more easily.” However, when it comes to promoting new drugs and vaccines for the disease, he knows exactly what needs to done to boost pharmaceutical stock prices: frighten the public, devise a ""solution,"" manipulate the study results, defraud the FDA's EUA process, leverage government officials and spin the drug as necessary, safe and effective for everyone.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-29-afl-exposes-facebook-documents-training-cdc-censoring-public.html,AFL exposes internal Facebook documents used for training CDC employees on censoring the public,"American conservative organization America First Legal (AFL) recently revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used Facebook onboarding documents to train CDC employees on how to "" censor Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and vaccine ""misinformation."" ""These documents show the architecture behind the systems that political appointees and governmental bureaucrats used to unconstitutionally censor the free speech of Americans online,"" AFL Director Gene Hamilton said in a statement. ""The right to speak – to even question authority – is so fundamental to our national identity, yet in the name of a public health crisis, Biden Administration officials worked with major companies to silence dissent."" According to Hamilton, the people need to review these documents and understand just how far leaders in Washington went to violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. Facebook trained CDC staff on how to use the platform's ""Government Reporting System."" As per the litigation, Facebook created a new ""end-to-end workflow,"" which is a streamlined process to make it easy for the government to censor the American people. The social media platform only gave access to approved government and law enforcement personnel. They were assigned to submit links for removal from Facebook. The said portal ""dramatically increased the efficiency of the censorship machine"" by allowing up to twenty links at a time to be referred for censoring. Each censorship request automatically generated a ticket number so that the government could track if Facebook complied with its censorship demands. The newly revealed documents further show how Facebook explained precisely what content it would remove and what it needed from the CDC to censor certain narratives within the bounds of its ""community standards."" According to the workers, they only removed information deemed ""false by public health authorities"" despite the many examples of these authorities later being proven wrong. Facebook's policy was to censor statements that made 'false' claims about masks (now shown to have been nearly useless, making those statements true), which discouraged social distancing (now known to have been fabricated by Dr. Anthony Fauci, former White House chief medical advisor). If an individual was a ""repeat offender"" of the government's ever-shifting determinations on ""misinformation,"" their account's reach would be reduced or removed from their site altogether. AFL also pointed out that the lawsuit exposed the United Kingdom's influence on the Biden-Harris administration's censorship policy and Meta (Facebook's parent company) CEO Mark Zuckerberg's admission that Facebook only engaged in censorship after extreme pressure from the current U.S. regime. (Related: Zuckerberg admits Biden admin pressured Meta to CENSOR content .) Zuckerberg regretted caving into Biden-Harris admin pressure to censor content Back in August, Zuckerberg told the House Judiciary Committee that he regretted colluding with the federal government when he faced significant pressure to censor content on Facebook and Instagram. In a letter to the committee's Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), he said: ""I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it. We're ready to push back if something like this happens again."" The letter refers specifically to the widespread suppression of contrarian viewpoints relating to COVID-19. Federal bureaucrats pushed social media platforms to take down content that could make people hesitate to submit to the vaccine mandate. President Joe Biden accused Zuckerberg and his moderators of ""killing people"" if they failed to moderate vaccine-skeptical content more aggressively. ""In 2021, senior officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire,"" wrote Zuckerberg. It was revealed that Zuckerberg's people and CDC officials exchanged emails where it was disclosed that the government took a heavy hand in suppressing content. The CDC also took the position that expressing skepticism about vaccinating children was a form of misinformation and should be policed, reports indicated. Zuckerberg also exposed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned him about Russian attempts to sow chaos on social media by releasing a fake story about the Biden family just before the 2020 election. This warning motivated Facebook to take action against the New York Post 's Hunter Biden laptop story when it was published in October 2020, which of course turned out to be true as well. ""We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" Zuckerberg further vowed.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-29-global-response-covid-hysterical-female-overreaction.html,Global response to COVID-19 compared to hysterical female overreaction,"Governments around the world undoubtedly overreacted to COVID-19. From blanket lockdowns to completely stripping people of their health freedom, the whole reaction to the virus was far more extreme than the situation warranted – and conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute think tank has likened the response to the reaction of a stereotypical “hysterical woman.” She said that COVID-19 was “the very embodiment of the female worldview which is unable to balance risks and benefits.” Although people of both genders are vulnerable to letting their emotions get the better of them during trying times, the collective response was so strongly emotional that it is hard to fathom how it even happened when we had so many facts early enough to prevent thrusting the world into unnecessary economic and psychological chaos. Data from Italy in the early days of the pandemic made it clear that the average age of people dying from the virus was 80. While advanced age doesn’t make it any easier to accept the loss of a loved one, it does mean that a blanket response was not warranted and pointed to the groups that did deserve our focus when it comes to prevention and protection. Moreover, we knew that most of the victims had three or more comorbidities. This group of individuals is nowhere near large enough to justify isolating everyone from their loved ones, closing down businesses for months, and barring people from attending events or dining in restaurants or going to church because they chose not to get a vaccine. Some of the reaction to the virus came across as placing feelings over facts, and that also ties into the stereotype of women following their emotions instead of slowing down and engaging in more rational thinking about the longer term. Manipulation and guilt trips over getting vaccinated Moreover, the fear and manipulation that were used to get people to comply with increasingly overreaching initiatives had “mom guilt trip” written all over them. This could be seen in, for example, the vaccine slogans that played on people’s emotions, saying that if you don’t get the jab for yourself, you should at least get it to “protect” those around you . How many times did we hear some variation of “Don’t kill grandma” during the vaccine rollout? Many people feel they were bullied into getting the jab, particularly those who had serious reservations about the safety of these untested vaccines but complied to avoid losing their jobs. It did all seem to have a “mean girl” tone to it much of the time, with many people reporting being ostracized by coworkers, friends and even family members for not following what the “in crowd” was doing and rolling up their sleeves. Schools around the world were closed based solely on “worst-case scenarios” that failed to take the bigger picture into consideration. Maternal instinct might drive some women to want to avoid risks at all costs, particularly when it comes to their children, but the facts made it abundantly clear that young people had almost no risk from the virus and suffered psychologically and academically as a result of school closures. Why did we act like young people were at risk when the facts said otherwise? The idea of a virus that could wipe out humanity is indeed a disturbing one and has long provided fodder for books and movies. When COVID-19 first started to make headlines, there was plenty of reason to panic, but once we started to see the bigger picture and understand the real risks, the fact that the hysteria over the virus actually gained steam rather than subsiding resulted in damage to society that could endure for decades to come – not to mention the price millions of people will pay in terms of their health after being bullied or guilted into getting COVID-19 vaccines.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-american-food-corporations-intentionally-poison-food-supply.html,"American food corporations that intentionally poison the American food supply should be prosecuted, say food safety experts","A coalition of activists, doctors and thought leaders gathered at a Senate Roundtable in Washington DC recently to discuss how ingredients in the food supply are impacting the health of Americans. They spoke to congressional leadership about the abysmal state of American health, and went in depth about the cancer-causing chemicals in agriculture, the poisons in the food supply, the corruption in the healthcare industry, among many other serious issues. The round table, hosted by Senator Ron Johnson, was titled, American Health & Nutrition: A Second Opinion . Those who testified included: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Dr. Jordan Peterson, Calley Means, Dr. Chris Palmer, Dr. Marty Makary, Max Lugavere, Dr. Casey Means, Grace Price, Courtney Swan, Alex Clark, Jason Karp, Brigham Buhler, Mikhaila Fuller, Jillian Michaels, and Vani Hari. The coalition testified about their own experiences taking on personal health challenges while confronting medical orthodoxy and the industries that intentionally poison the food supply for profit. These are serious discussions that will impact the future of children’s health – discussions that should be expanded and acted upon, to ultimately alter the chronic disease epidemic that is currently ravaging the country. Toxic chemicals are intentionally put in American products to addict consumers and boost corporate profits One of the speakers – Vani Hari – talked about overcoming her health challenges and questioning the American food supply. Vani has been a clean food activist for over a decade and started her own company offering clean products. In her speech , she called out American food corporations for manufacturing products that are drastically more toxic in America, while selling the same products in Europe, but with far less toxic ingredients. Vani called out the “unethical policies of American food companies” that insist on selling “safer versions of their products in other countries, while selling our own citizens ingredients that are heavily regulated or banned abroad .” The American version of these products often contain artificial dyes, BHT and MSG which are linked to endocrine disruption, infertility, neurological dysfunction and cancer. The American products have a longer shelf life because they contain chemical preservatives. The American products are also intentionally designed to be more addictive, but the chemicals used to trick consumers into eating more are toxic and linked to brain damage. For example, Gatorade Zero Fruit Punch in the U.S. contains caramel color and Red 40, while the German version doesn’t contain either toxin. The alternative versions sold in Europe are colored with natural pigments from fruits and vegetables. McDonald's French fries contain 11 ingredients in the United States, but only contain 3 ingredients in the UK. One of the ingredients in the U.S. version is dimethylpolysiloxane, a foaming agent preserved with neurotoxic formaldehyde. By using this foaming agent, McDonald’s workers do not have to change out the cooking oil as often, boosting corporate profits at the expense of consumer health. Food corporations should be subject to stringent regulations to protect Americans’ health With these revelations now going mainstream, American food corporations must consider providing Americans with the same products they sell to Europeans. To hold these corporations accountable, LEGISLATION should be written at the federal level, complete with scientific citations documenting the harms that these dyes, flavor chemicals and preservatives cause. This legislation should mandate that American food products be free of brain-damaging, endocrine-disrupting and cancer-causing ingredients. A database of all the toxic ingredients could readily be compiled, along with a product list that includes these toxic ingredients. Future regulatory pressure should incentivize sweeping changes to the American food supply, providing strict deadlines for food manufacturers to eliminate toxins and reformulate their products. If mass harm can be proven for an individual ingredient, and a corporation refuses to remove it from their products, then they should be prosecuted in a court of law for injuring Americans’ health. A restructured FDA must be equipped to enforce new regulations on an industry that is causing health problems across generations. These actions could help break up monopolies and allow smaller, clean food companies to compete in the marketplace as well. Sources include: Rumble.com Foodbabe.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-whistleblower-interview-origin-lyme-disease-likely-bioweapon.html,"WHISTLEBLOWER INTERVIEW: Origin of LYME DISEASE as a likely bioweapon exposed by award-winning medical science writer Kris Newby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.","Kris Newby is an award-winning medical science writer and the producer of the Lyme disease documentary “Under our Skin,” which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was an Oscar semifinalist in 2010. Kris Newby has spent two decades studying Lyme Disease after contracting and suffering from it herself. She also authored “Bitten” that won three international book awards, and previously worked as a science and technology writer for Stanford Medical School. In a mind-blowing, whistle-blowing interview with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., founder of Children’s Health Defense, they expose the origin of Lyme disease as a likely BIOWEAPON, just like Covid-19 and the deadly mRNA clot shots that came with the plandemic. Kris Newby contracted Lyme Disease, along with her husband in 2002, and it took ten doctors over a year to finally get a diagnosis, and they spent over $60,000 in medical costs dealing with it. Meanwhile, it took Mrs. Newby and her husband 5 to 6 years to finally heal from it. After the debacle, she created a documentary about the politics, money and pharma corruption behind getting “tested” and “treated” for Lyme Disease. The Lyme Disease pharma mystery where patients are gas-lit about their so-called “psychological” symptoms and the man who discovered Lyme Disease lied about it Turns out the scientist who discovered the origin of Lyme Disease in 1981, Willy Burgdorfer, was instructed to cover it up, per the interview with him and the in-depth research Kris Newby has done. Burgdorfer admitted on camera that he did not tell the truth about the discovery of Lyme Disease, testifying that there was “another organism” present when he investigated the outbreak of the sickness, and he was told to cover it up. RFK Jr. attests in the interview that it is highly likely that Lyme Disease is a military weapon, just like Covid-19 and the corresponding mRNA jabs, as the military experimented with ticks and injected them with pathogens that would cause severe disability and disease, including death, to use as a bioweapon against potential enemies. This was, in fact, investigated by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, to find out whether the Pentagon morphed these blood-sucking insects so they would become military-grade biological weapons of mass destruction to be used in war against enemy combatants from 1950 to 1975. The U.S. bioweapons research and insidious testing of biological warfare on humans began many decades ago with Project Paperclip, and continues today with funded research, including the Wuhan lab creation of the “novel” virus Covid-19 and its gain-of-function capability. If you think the U.S. government and the military industrial complex is not evil enough to use bioweapons against its own people, think again. This is well-documented, and RFK Jr. and Kris Newby are helping expose it all.

Cole, who underwent harmful transgender treatment between the ages of 13 and 17 years old before accepting her biological identity, announced her support for Trump in a post on her official account on X, formerly Twitter, on Sept. 23. Cole cited the commitment of the former president in cutting access to sex change procedures for minors as the driving factor for her endorsement. ""I am a detransitioner, a formerly transgender child. I was directly harmed by Kamala Harris’ radical policies. I am endorsing President Donald Trump because he has promised to put a stop to sex changes for minors ,"" Cole wrote on X, along with a video describing how, at the age of 12, she was brainwashed by medical professionals to pursue gender transition after telling her she was transgender. (Related: Former trans teens express REGRET over gender reassignment procedures. ) ""I was told that puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries were my only options,"" she recalled in the video, adding that ""they were wrong."" She also explained that after undergoing surgeries, including the removal of both breasts, she now faces ""irreversible changes"" to her body. Cole went on to claim that Vice President Kamala Harris and her policies only push children into medical decisions that they may regret later in life. ""Today, Kamala Harris is pushing children into these procedures, limited their choices later on in life,"" Cole warned. ""That's why I'm voting for Donald Trump , because he's committed to protecting children from these rash decisions."" Trump vows to end all ""gender-affirming"" care for minors if elected in November In February 2023, Trump released a set of proposals to curb so-called ""gender-affirming"" care for minors , along with other policies that would target access to transgender procedures if he gets elected in November. In a video posted on his account on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump outlined measures that would use federal power to ban so-called gender-affirming medical treatments for minors and limit education on gender identity. Trump described ""gender-affirming"" care for minors as ""child abuse"" and ""child sexual mutilation,"" and he vowed to prohibit federal agencies from promoting and facilitating sex and gender transitions at any age. He also said he would direct multiple federal agencies to monitor and prevent access to gender care for minors. Trump also pledged to push Congress to pass a law banning transgender care nationwide and called for an investigation into the pharmaceutical industry and hospitals that grant access to transgender care for minors. He suggested that these institutions may have concealed long-term side effects of gender transitions for financial gain. Trump referred to these procedures as ""unforgivable,"" so he vowed that he would make it easier for individuals who regret receiving gender-affirming care as minors to sue their doctors. Aside from health care, Trump also claimed that his second administration would implement policies to promote ""positive education about the nuclear family"" and reinforce traditional gender roles. Teachers who suggest to students that they might be ""trapped in the wrong body"" could face civil rights penalties and schools could lose federal funding."" In short, Trump would push for a federal law recognizing only two genders . ""I will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female, and they are assigned at birth,"" Trump said. ""No serious country should be telling its children that they were born with the wrong gender, a concept that was never heard of in all of human history. Nobody's ever heard of this. Under my leadership, this madness will end."" GenderConfused.news has more stories about the repercussions of gender reassignment surgeries.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-court-rules-against-epas-longstanding-water-fluoridation-practices.html,"VICTORY: Court rules against the EPA’s longstanding water fluoridation practices, provides compelling evidence that fluoride damages children’s brains","A landmark federal court ruling has found fluoride levels in U.S. drinking water to pose unnecessary risks to children’s IQ and cognition. The decision, which supports the science-backed claims of the Fluoride Action Network and other health advocacy groups, found that current fluoride levels endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pose an unreasonable risk to children's cognitive development. The court found that fluoride levels of 0.7 mg/L – the level recommended by the EPA – can lead to a significant reduction in children's IQ. Fluoridated water affects approximately 75 percent of Americans . This ruling is compelling because it confirms what ""conspiracy theorists"" have been saying for many years. Populations are being intentionally poisoned without consent. Courts turn on the EPA, rule against water fluoridation The ruling, issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, is a major victory for the next generation of children and adults, who now have the evidence to end fluoridation of water supplies in their respective communities, once and for all. The Fluoride Action Network has long argued that fluoride is harmful to public health, but the chemical has been added to water supplies across the nation, without anyone’s consent. This is akin to drugging people without their knowledge. The court's decision is based on a review of scientific evidence, including a study by the U.S. Government's National Toxicology Program, which identified a clear link between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental harm. Specifically, for every 0.28 mg/L increase in fluoride levels in a pregnant mother's urine, the child's IQ was found to decrease by one point. The study also suggests that, even at levels lower than 1.5 mg/L, fluoride exposure can have a negative impact on cognitive development. This court decision contradicts decades of dental associations and governments promoting fluoridated water as safe and beneficial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has even named community water fluoridation as one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. However, the new ruling suggests that these claims were always exaggerated and unfounded. Ending the chronic disease epidemic starts with water purity Health professionals, researchers and advocacy groups have been raising concerns about the safety of fluoride for years. They argue that fluoride is not only found in drinking water but also in processed foods, dental products and other daily sources. Some companies actually sell water for babies that contains added fluoride. This means that the total exposure to fluoride for many people is much higher than what is considered safe. The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) is one of several organizations pressing for widespread changes to water fluoridation practices across the country. “It’s time for the EPA, CDC and other health authorities to stop ignoring the science and start protecting the health of future generations,” said IAOMT President Yuko Torigoe, DMD. “We need transparent regulations based on the latest research, not outdated practices that put our children at risk.” The Academy urges local, state and federal officials to immediately halt fluoridation programs and implement public health policies that align with the latest scientific evidence, including a ban on water fluoridation. This court ruling could lead to increased scrutiny of municipal water supplies and a re-evaluation of the benefits and risks of fluoridated water. The court's ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the debate over water fluoridation for years to come, and sets a new precedent for the removal of fluoride from water sources entirely. Ending the chronic disease epidemic in America starts with ensuring that the water is pure and does not include additives that damage the brains of future generations.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-harris-blames-abortion-laws-death-pregnant-women.html,Kamala Harris blames Georgia abortion laws for death of two pregnant women who took abortion pills,"Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris has blamed the anti-abortion laws of Georgia for the death of two women who took abortion pills. During a campaign stop in Atlanta on Sept. 20, Harris spoke about Amber Thurman, a 28-year-old medical assistant and a single mother who died of sepsis after delays in receiving care at a hospital in Georgia. Thurman discovered she was pregnant with twins in August, but her focus was on her nursing career, so she decided to seek an abortion. Thurman traveled to North Carolina to seek a surgical procedure, but she was instead prescribed an abortion pill. However, complications arose after she took the pills , which eventually led to her death. In her speech, Harris claimed that Thurman was a victim of Georgia's pro-life law, which restricts abortion access after approximately six weeks of pregnancy. Harris also argued that the health complications of Thurman were exacerbated after the procedure because state doctors feared legal repercussions for providing post-abortion care. (Related: Kamala Harris releases three pro-abortion ads targeting Trump while advocating a free-for-all of nationwide baby murder .) ""When she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion, but because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed. But when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care, so she went to a hospital. But, you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed,"" Harris said. Harris also mentioned Candi Miller's story, whose life she said had been similarly affected by the state's abortion policies, but Harris did not elaborate on the case. ""Now we know that at least two women – and those are only the stories we know – here in the state of Georgia died – died because of a Trump abortion ban,"" Harris said. Live Action debunks falsehood about abortion law in Georgia Kavitha Surana of ProPublica also made similar claims earlier this September, but pro-life organization Live Action disputed these claims . Surana wrote in her article that Thurman needed a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure to clear the fetal tissue from her uterus, but Piedmont Henry Hospital refused to do so for fear of violation of the new Georgia law. However, Live Action clarified this is only true when they are used to intentionally terminate a pregnancy. Meaning, D&Cs, in general, remain legal for treating miscarriages or other medical conditions. Additionally, medical professionals involved in the case have not confirmed that the law was the reason for not performing a D&C sooner. The organization also argued that Surana downplayed the known risks associated with the abortion pill, which includes sepsis – an improper response of the body to infection. Mifepristone, one of the drugs used in the abortion regimen, carries a black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about its potential dangers despite claims that it is ""safer than Tylenol."" The pro-life group also fact-checked the abortion case and the death of Miller with the same claims. All this fact-checking happened before Harris' campaign stop in Atlanta, but it didn't deter her from using Thurman and Miller to repeat falsehoods about abortion laws in Georgia.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-tcm-monomers-offer-hope-safer-cervical-cancer-treatment.html,Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers offer hope for SAFER cervical cancer treatments,"Research into the molecular mechanisms of cervical cancer has highlighted the P13K/Akt signaling pathway as a key player in cancer progression. While various treatments have been developed to target this pathway, current therapies often come with severe side effects, limiting their effectiveness and patient tolerance. In recent years, attention has shifted to the potential of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in addressing these issues. TCM monomers – natural compounds derived from medicinal herbs and other plant sources – have shown promise in regulating the P13K/Akt pathway with fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments. (Related: How to prevent and heal cervical cancer naturally .) Researchers are increasingly exploring these monomers as an alternative or complementary approach to cervical cancer treatment, offering hope for safer and more effective therapies. With its roots in thousands of years of practice, TCM may hold the key to new, gentler treatment options for this devastating disease that remains a significant health concern worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where it is a leading cause of death among women aged 20-39. Below are some of the well-studied TCM monomers and their effects on cervical cancer. Alkaloids Found in numerous medicinal plants, alkaloids have demonstrated potent anticancer effects. Compounds, such as harmine, matrine, oxymatrine and sinomenine, are known to inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of cervical cancer cells. They also induce apoptosis – making them effective in both laboratory (in vitro) and animal (in vivo) models of cancer. Cinnamaldehyde Extracted from cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde has emerged as a promising anticancer agent. Research showed that in mouse models of cervical cancer, cinnamaldehyde blocked the P13K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibiting tumor growth and improving overall health . Doses of 60 mg/kg and 240 mg/kg administered for 14 days significantly reduced tumor development – highlighting its potential as a novel treatment option. Other monomers, such as beta-elemene, fucoxanthin, schisandrin B and zeylenone, have similar structures similar to cinnamaldehyde. These monomers also effectively block cell cycle progression, inducing apoptosis and restraining the growth of cervical cancer cells. Flavonoids Naturally occurring in many plants and common in fruits and vegetables, flavonoids offer a wide range of health benefits. Their anticancer properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, are well-documented. Examples, such as ampelopsin, apigenin, baicalin, baicalein, formononetin, isoorientin, kaempferol, liquirigenin, luteolin and quercetin, have been found to inhibit the invasion, migration and proliferation of cervical cancer cells while inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle progression. Polyphenols Widely found in foods and drinks, such as fruits, nuts, soy, spices, tea, vegetables and wine, polyphenols have strong anticancer effects due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyphenols, like curcumin, paeonol and resveratrol, are known to modulate molecular targets in cancer cells – suppressing their invasion, migration and proliferation while promoting apoptosis and autophagy, which is the process of cellular self-destruction. Quinones These are plant-derived compounds known for their antimetastatic and antiproliferative effects on various cancers. In the context of cervical cancer, monomers, like juglone, polydatin, quinalizarin and shikonin, have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, halt cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis. Saponins Found extensively in plants, saponins have demonstrated significant anticancer potential, including cytotoxic, cytostatic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-invasive activities. Their ability to induce apoptosis, block cell cycle progression and suppress cell proliferation has been evidenced in various cancer studies. Compounds, such as astragaloside IV, ginsenosides extracts, RCE4 and saponins extract from Panax notoginseng are among the most effective in treating cervical cancers. Terpenoids Representing the largest class of natural compounds, terpenoids with notable anticancer properties, include betulin, betulinic acid, celastrol, corosolic acid, ganoderic acid A, glaucocalyxin B, glycyrrhizin, norcantharidin, oridonin and pseudolaric acid B. They have shown antitumor activities, including the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and disruption of cell cycle progression. Their diversity and effectiveness make them a highly-studied group in cervical cancer research. In summary, TCM monomers offer a natural and promising alternative for cervical cancer treatment – particularly through their ability to regulate the P13K/Akt pathway. These compounds, with their diverse biological activities and lower toxicity compared to conventional treatments, have opened new avenues in the fight against cervical cancer.

Nurse Angela from CHD joined Lorenze to provide a video update about her condition, which you can watch at CHD.tv . In case you missed it, Lorenze lost her vision and suffered horrific bruising all around her forehead and face after she received the vaccine trio. Lorenze did not want to take the shots, but she had to in order to receive a necessary blood transfusion for a rare autoimmune disorder called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PHD. ""The extremely rare condition affects approximately one in a million people, causing the immune system to attack and destroy red blood cells,"" reports explain about Lorenze's autoimmune condition. (Related: Did you know that vaccines have destroyed public health and society in such a way that it can never be reversed [apart from an extinction-level event, perhaps].) UCI Medical forces young lady to take life-destroying jabs in order to receive a blood transfusion Lorenze had traveled all the way across the country from Florida to California to receive the blood transfusion. Doctors at UCI Medical in Orange County where Lorenze went told her that in order to proceed, they needed to first inject her all at once for tetanus, pneumonia and meningitis, otherwise Lorenze would be sent back to Florida without her transfusion. Desperate for relief, Lorenze complied with UCI Medical's demands. Within just 10 minutes of getting injected, however, Lorenze's vision darkened in both of her eyes. Her jaw also locked up and she started vomiting as her body swelled and bruised seemingly inexplicably. Administering multiple vaccine injections at once, especially to someone with serious autoimmune disease, is a recipe for health disaster that UCI Medical should have known not to do. They did it anyway, though. ""While it's usually safe for most people to get these vaccines together, in her case, the immune response could have been too much and led to complications,"" commented Dr. Raj. Dasgupta, chief medical advisor for Fortune Recommends Health. ""To avoid overloading her system, it would be reasonable to space out the vaccines and closely monitor for any worsening symptoms."" Better yet, how about not taking the vaccines at all under any timeframe? The body has an immune system for a reason, and injecting vaccine chemicals into it only damages its ability to fight disease naturally. One silver lining is that Lorenze is said to be doing a lot better than she was.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-treat-your-body-as-temple-of-holy-spirit.html,"Sermon 8: Treat your body as a temple of the Holy Spirit, Mike Adams says","The Health Ranger Mike Adams talked about treating the human body as a temple of the Holy Spirit during his eighth sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report"" podcast, part of his 100 Sermons series. Adams based his sermon from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Holy Bible. ( 1 Corinthians 6 ) The Bible nutrition educator cited 1 Corinthians 6:19-20: ""Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body."" ""The body of a follower of Christ is a temple, a holy place within that is representative of the Body of Christ. Christ paid a price so that believers could enjoy their life without having to carry the burden of sin upon themselves,"" Adams said. The Brighteon.com founder stressed that a believer has a responsibility to act according to the requirements or guidance of the Lord. He added that believers who continue to commit sins against their bodies are not just snubbing or insulting Christ, but are also ignoring the price that Christ paid for them. (Related: The Sondra Heartstone Show: God desires obedience over sacrifice, says Carolyn Figlioli – Brighteon.TV .) ""When people make decisions about their bodies, especially when it comes to nutrition, health and living a clean lifestyle, they are impacting not just their physical body but also their spiritual body,"" Adams said. ""You are physically a representation of Christ and God. You are a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, and therefore the actions that you take reflect on your relationship with God and your honoring of this idea that your body is a holy representation of the mind of God, the will of God, the creation power of God."" Your body is not an amusement park According to Adams, a believer should honor the requirements to live in alignment with Christ and God, which include avoiding self-mutilation and not putting tattoo marks on the body. ""Don't use your body like an amusement park. It's not here for your narcissistic pleasures, habits, addictions or enjoyments. Your body is a vehicle in service to God, and your body is a temple. It is something important and valuable, and it needs to be held in reverence,"" Adams said. He also stressed the importance of eating clean and healthy foods to support the body, mind and spirit. Meaning, people should avoid toxic substances as much as possible, including junk foods, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals and processed ingredients. Adams noted that a sickness or disease would take away a person's ability to serve the Lord and fulfill God's purpose in their life. ""So good health is a prerequisite to being able to carry out the higher goals and higher functions in this lifetime, and importantly choosing what you eat, what you swallow, what you consume, what you put on your skin,"" Adams said.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-facebook-trained-cdc-employees-censor-american-public.html,Facebook provided secret online tools and trained CDC employees how to censor the American public,"The American First Legal team is currently litigating against Facebook and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for violating the First Amendment and censoring Americans on important topics that drastically affect their lives. The litigation has just exposed onboarding documents that Facebook (Meta) employees used to train CDC employees on how to censor the American public. Facebook employees coordinated with government employees under the Biden regime to block Americans from learning the truth about COVID-19 and the so-called vaccines . Their censorship portal was titled “Covid & Vaccine Misinformation.” The CDC was allowed to censor more than 16 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram, citing “vaccine misinformation” as the reason. Biden regime and Facebook’s censorship machinations are a threat to the republic In 2021, the Biden-Harris regime pressured social media companies to eliminate important dialogue and public discourse on various issues related to COVID-19. Only accepted government narratives were allowed online. Facebook caved to the pressure and gave the CDC online tools so the government could control speech online. In fact, the litigation documents reveal that Facebook, under pressure from the administration, implemented a new system of censorship, allowing government officials to efficiently request the removal of Facebook posts. This system streamlined the process, enabling officials to submit multiple links for censorship and providing a way to track compliance through ticket numbers. In the portal, CDC employees chose their “Reason for Reporting” to remove a Facebook user’s post. These reasons included “COVID Misinformation,” “Vaccine Discouragement,” and COVID Vaccine Misinformation.” Access to this portal was restricted to approved personnel, making oversight by outside organizations more difficult. Additionally, Facebook clarified the criteria for content removal in collaboration with the CDC. The documents indicate that Facebook outlined specific types of content it would remove and detailed what information it required from the CDC to justify censoring certain narratives while adhering to its community standards. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged that Facebook caved to government pressure. American First Legal Executive Director Gene Hamilton wrote about the latest findings: These documents show–definitively–the architecture behind the systems that political appointees and governmental bureaucrats used to unconstitutionally censor the free speech of Americans online. The right to speak–to even question authority–is so fundamental to our national identity, yet in the name of a public health crisis, Biden Administration officials worked with major companies to silence dissent. The American people need to review these documents and understand just how far our leaders in Washington went to violate the First Amendment to our Constitution. CDC removed vaccine truth from Facebook, brainwashing the public and harming countless lives The CDC removed Facebook posts dissenting about social distancing, face masks and testing. All of these devices of control turned out to exacerbate disease theater that not only caused further hysteria, but also damaged the social fabric of society. When the disastrous COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out, the CDC targeted information on spike protein shedding from the vaccines and disregarded the negative effects shedding had on women’s menstrual cycles, ovulation and miscarriage risk. The CDC censored common adverse events from the vaccine and ignored the fatalities from the shot, disregarding all evidence suggesting the vaccine was a depopulation weapon. In fact, any information that “discouraged” vaccine uptake was targeted and removed. These coercive actions had a chilling effect on the informed consent principle and led to widespread violations of body autonomy rights and medical ethics throughout society. Updates to Facebook’s community standards were quick to punish repeat offenders who spread so-called misinformation. People who made repeated “false claims about masks” for example, or who discouraged “social distancing” had their account’s reach reduced or removed altogether. “Pages Groups, profiles, and Instagram accounts that repeatedly post misinformation or coordinated harm (see Coordinating Harm policies at the top of this entry) related to COVID-19, vaccines, and health may face restrictions, including (but not limited to) reduced distribution, removal from recommendations, or removal from our site.” The Biden regime made censorship easy, and Facebook caved to the pressure, providing them unlimited power to restrict free speech and stifle the truth on matters that affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. The federal agents who participated in this censorship scheme harmed countless lives with their vaccine propaganda and controlling narratives. Sources include: AFLegal.org Judiciary.House.gov [PDF]"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-court-dismisses-lawsuit-patient-switched-ivermectin-remdesivir.html,Court dismisses wrongful death lawsuit against hospital where COVID-19 patient died after being switched from ivermectin to remdesivir,"The Nevada Supreme Court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the family of a man whose doctors switched his ivermectin treatment to remdesivir and other drugs without his permission while he was hospitalized with COVID-19. Hal de Becker was being treated by his family doctor with ivermectin after he developed COVID-19 symptoms in spring of 2021. However, he was then admitted to the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center out of an “abundance of caution” so he could undergo close monitoring. The two doctors who served as his attending physicians at the hospital decided to stop giving him ivermectin and started giving him remdesivir and other drugs instead, and his condition quickly deteriorated. He died shortly after being released from the hospital. His family says that this change was made against their wishes, which they clearly expressed to the hospital and two of the doctors treating him, and they insist the drug was switched without consulting them. They filed a lawsuit, suing the doctors and the hospital itself for wrongful death and negligence. They maintain that the physicians and hospital were aware of the scientific evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of ivermectin against the virus but chose remdesivir instead in decisions that they believe were influenced by the media and political beliefs. They also claim that the hospital and the doctors violated the family's right to informed consent when they failed to consult with them or his family doctor about the decisions they made about his treatment. Hospital claims PREP Act protects them The lawsuit was dismissed by the Nevada Supreme Court, who ruled that the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act gives medical professionals and healthcare institutions immunity from liability for any claims of loss that are “caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure.” These covered countermeasures include not only medications and vaccines but also devices and other products that have been authorized to treat patients in declared medical emergencies. According to the court, the man's family does not have grounds to sue because remdesivir is considered a covered countermeasure. However, they added that even if the PREP Act was not applicable in this case, the fact that the family did not provide some specific legal documents that were needed in an affidavit to prove professional negligence would have put the case in jeopardy either way. The family has already appealed the dismissal. PREP Act helps doctors get away with violating patients' fundamental rights Unfortunately, the PREP Act offers broad legal protection for doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies even when they are violating patients' fundamental rights. Some legal experts believe that the case should serve as an example of why legislative action is needed to prevent these acts from causing damage. Children's Health Defense General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg said: “The decision illuminates the way in which PREP has essentially run roughshod over other laws, including here, state informed consent law.” She added that a classification of a product shouldn’t overrule a person’s rights to make decisions about their own healthcare . “It is concerning that simply because a pharmaceutical product is defined as a ‘covered countermeasure,’ doctors can ignore, without repercussions, an obligation to obtain informed consent. The status of a product should not determine a patient’s rights to make a decision about whether or not to receive a treatment,” she said. "

Diddy and many other elite rapists, sex offenders?","The downfall of rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs (aka P. Diddy) and Harvey Weinstein before him is once again shining a light on the many elitist rapists and sex offenders who are close friends of Barack and Michelle Obama. P. Diddy is dominating media headlines right now for the wickedness he and his friends perpetrated on Justin Bieber and many others in the music industry who were taken advantage of, often in sexually perverse ways. And the Obamas keep coming up as co-conspirators in the whole mess. Barack and P. Diddy have been close friends for a long while now. They attended the same parties, appeared in pictures together, and were all-around chummy with one another until P. Diddy's time was up, which appears to be now. To be fair, P. Diddy appeared in pictures with Donald Trump, too, along with Kamala Harris and many others. It would seem as though both sides of the aisle roll with the same perverts, though perhaps not for the same reasons. (Related: Did you know that Joe Biden was just Obama's ""useful idiot"" puppet ?

Diddy interviewed both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who we also know would go on to run for president on the Democrat ticket. With the now-downfall of P. Diddy, video footage of the guy carousing with Barack has resurfaced to suggest that the two were much closer than many people would choose to believe. ""This is part of what is important about giving back,"" the young Obama said about P. Diddy, praising him for supporting Democrats that year ""because he doesn't have to do this."" P. Diddy's responded jovially to Obama's praise, making fun of him for sweating at the convention. P. Diddy also said to Obama that he ""wanted to apologize for not sweating"" – and as he said this, Obama patted P. Diddy on the head with a napkin. P. Diddy reemerged in 2008 to push Obama on America for what would become Obama's first presidential term. P. Diddy hosted a ""Last Chance for Change"" rally in support of Obama just days before the election that year. Kamala likewise praised P.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-grape-flavonoids-key-to-longevity-overall-wellness.html,Grape flavonoids are key to longevity and overall wellness,"For centuries, grapes have been a staple in human diets – from ancient civilizations to the vineyards of modern Europe. While they have long been associated with health and vitality, it is only recently that science has begun to unlock their true potential. The secret to their health benefits lies in powerful phytocompound polyphenols called flavonoids , which not only protect the brain and heart but also support overall wellness. Flavonoids are a group of natural compounds found in plants, including grapes – the most mentioned plant in the Bible scriptures. These powerful antioxidants protect the body from oxidative stress, which plays a significant role in aging and the development of chronic diseases – long-lasting health conditions. Grapes, particularly their skins and seeds, are packed with these potent phytocompounds and they offer a range of benefits for the brain, heart, skin and more. Longevity The health benefits of flavonoids largely come down to their ability to combat oxidative stress – a process that accelerates aging and damage. Over time, oxidative stress leads to chronic conditions, like cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases – disorders that affect the brain and nervous system like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Grape flavonoids help neutralize harmful free radicals – slowing the damage caused, extending the lifespan of cells and possibly even extending life expectancy . Heart health and cardiovascular function One of the most well-known health benefits of grapes and grape-based products, such as red wine, is their ability to support heart health . This phenomenon, known as the ""French Paradox"" highlights how populations in France, despite consuming diets rich in fats, have lower rates of heart disease. Researchers believe that regular consumption of red wine, which is rich in resveratrol and other grape flavonoids, plays a significant role in this. Grapes promote heart health and cardiovascular function by the following mechanisms, among many others: Lower blood pressure . Resveratrol helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow and reducing strain on the heart. Improve cholesterol levels . Grape flavonoids help reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL), lowering heart disease risk. Prevent blood clots . Resveratrol has been linked to a lower risk of irritation and swelling (called inflammation) and blood clotting properties, which may help reduce the risk of strokes and other cardiovascular events. By lowering inflammation in blood vessels, flavonoids reduce the risk of atherosclerosis – a condition where arteries become clogged with fatty deposits. Including grapes, grape juice or even moderate wine in diets could support long-term heart and cardiovascular health. Brain health and cognitive function In addition to protecting the heart, grape flavonoids play a role in preserving brain health. Resveratrol, in particular, has been shown to have neuroprotective properties – helping to protect neurons and prevent the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that flavonoids, the most abundant biologically active phytonutrients among grape polyphenols, improve blood flow to the brain – protecting against cognitive decline (more frequent confusion and worsening memory loss) as we age. A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that flavonoids prevented the formation of beta amyloid plaques – abnormal protein clumps that accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's – and resveratrol, in particular, improved memory with reduced formation of these harmful unusual clumps and neurofibrillary tangles. This finding provides hope for future therapies aimed at preventing or slowing cognitive impairment in humans. Anticancer Grape flavonoids have also been studied for their anti-cancer properties. They may help prevent the development of certain types of cancers by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth. Research shows that flavonoids such as quercetin and resveratrol can interfere with the growth of cancer cells in the breast, colon and prostate. They may also reduce the risk of metastasis – where cancer spreads from one part of the body to another. Skin health and rejuvenation Beyond their internal benefits, grape flavonoids also have significant effects on skin health. By protecting skin cells from oxidative damage and UV radiation, these natural compounds help prevent premature aging. They also support the production of collagen – a protein that keeps skin firm and elastic. The anti-inflammatory properties of grape flavonoids help reduce skin inflammation, which can greatly contribute to conditions like acne (a skin condition that causes blocked pores and pimples), eczema ( a condition that makes skin dry, itchy and red) and rosacea ( a chronic skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels).

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-us-military-already-knew-ivermectin-best-pandemic.html,"The U.S. military, creator of the COVID VACCINE, already knew since 2016 that IVERMECTIN was the BEST product to use in the event of a pandemic","According to Dr. Christopher Shoemaker, an emergency and general hospital medicine doctor across Canada, when the original SARS-CoV-1 occurred, many experiments were conducted by top-level scientists and immunologists to see what could be a “useful response” if something similar was to spread. This research was done over 15+ years, completed by 2016. DARPA, the American research arm of the U.S. military, “specifically knew” and “ specifically recommended ” information to the CDC that “ Ivermectin, in particular, was the absolute number one product to be used in the event of a Coronavirus pandemic.” Dr. Shoemaker, a courageous whistleblower of the whole scamdemic, emphatically added that hydroxychloroquine was also a known go-to cure for Covid. Both of these antidotes were “highly antiviral and immune modulatory, and those two things were the key.” He said both elements were “ totally proven ” and “of course, we knew it was completely safe for humans, because these medications have been used for 35 to 40 years in humans, so that’s what was sitting there, ready to be used at the next pandemic.” Well-respected Canadian Dr. Shoemaker describes the disastrous and unprecedented prohibitions on prescribing known proper medications to Covid patients Dr. Shoemaker, a very knowledgeable physician, describes a stunning amount of data revealing that the vaccine actually helps children and society to contract Covid, and he also says we should all avoid the dirty, deadly mRNA vaccines. He said the vaccines RAISE death rates to significantly high numbers in children, youth and young adults. This is exactly why the CDC and FDA strictly prohibited medical doctors from prescribing Ivermectin to patients before and during their Covid attacks, so that the virus numbers and death tolls would skyrocket, enabling Big Government to take away American’s medical freedom of choice, constitutional rights to free speech and free press, and help Big Pharma bankroll off the Fauci Flu trillion-dollar cash cow. This testimony by Dr. Shoemaker is another smoking gun about how the whole pandemic really was a PLANDEMIC, including the lab-made gain-of-function virus, the deadliest vaccines to follow, and the absolute censorship and disinformation campaign about the best cures for Covid. Mainstream media was the “right arm” of Big Pharma, pushing all the lies and disinformation on the masses, around the globe, but especially in America. It’s unbelievable that nobody is in prison for it. Not one single politician, scientist, disease “expert,” reporter, news pundit, talk show host, Biden, Harris, nobody. Where is justice? People should be on trial for mass murder, conspiracy to commit murder, possession and distribution of (mRNA and Covid) biological weapons of mass destruction. It’s vaccine violence. Ivermectin was identified by DARPA Biological Technologies as a curative, in April 2020, for Covid, and was declared through scientific evaluation to work throughout all phases of Covid illness because it both “inhibits viral replication and modulates the immune response.” To add insult to injury, take a look at the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Report System) graph for the first 14 days after the masses got vaccinated for Covid, and check out the mass-murdering first TWO DAYS after the injections were administered. These folks were listed by the corrupt Vaccine Industrial Complex as “unvaccinated” so that the massive death toll wouldn’t be documented properly for all to see.

He based this sermon on the Book of Revelation in the New Testament , with a passage making mention of ""cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense"" (Revelation 18:13). Frankincense is clearly depicted in the Bible as something of great value to be taken away from cities like Babylon that turned against God, Adams remarked. It is also depicted as a gift, with frankincense being one of the three gifts given to the Child Jesus alongside gold and myrrh (Matthew 2:11). According to Adams, frankincense is made through incisions cut into the bark of the frankincense shrub. The milky juice that comes out the incisions hardens into tears, which are then collected after a few weeks. This aromatic gum from the frankincense shrub is ""used for incense, perfume, holy ointments and as a fumigant,"" he remarked, adding that it is ""highly esteemed by the Egyptians for embalming and fumigating."" In Lebanon, frankincense is primarily favored as incense and then as a medicine or cosmetic. In Tanzania, frankincense resin is boiled in sesame oil and taken to address schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease. East Africans use frankincense resin to treat syphilis, while Asian Indians use the resin for rheumatism and nervous system disorders. Meanwhile, the Chinese use frankincense for urogenital ailments. Elsewhere in Asia, frankincense is used for leprosy and rheumatism aside from repelling mosquitoes. Frankincense is widely used in medicine The founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com said that aside from being an important ingredient of incense and perfume, frankincense is also widely used in medicine. He cited the book of Dr. James Duke titled ""The Herbs of the Bible,"" which listed several benefits of frankincense as treatment against dysentery, fever, gonorrhea and polyps. Adams mentioned that a 35-grain dose of frankincense is said to improve a person's memory. Inhaling frankincense vapors is said to alleviate bronchitis and laryngitis, he added. In the world of natural medicine, people use frankincense – including its essential oil – to address cancer. (Related: Frankincense oil kills cancer cells while boosting the immune system, studies show .) He cited a study published May 2019 in Oncotarget about frankincense essential oil suppressing melanoma (a type of skin cancer). According to the study, frankincense essential oil in both in vitro and in vivo models ""induces a significant dose-dependent reduction in the cell viability of both mouse and human melanoma cells."" Frankincense essential oil was also found to help protect the liver from damage caused by the painkiller acetaminophen. It also reversed the damage caused by this prescription drug. ""Frankincense is known to induce tumor remission, apoptosis or cell death of cancer cells, and it's known to protect the liver,"" Adams remarked, adding that frankincense is readily available as an essential oil. ""The bottom line is frankincense is a very powerful natural medicine and it's strongly associated with spiritual purity and spiritual cleanliness.""

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has accused pharmaceutical companies of price gouging , alleging that they charge almost $1,000 for diabetes drugs that only cost them a measly $5 to manufacture. The lawmaker zeroed in on pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of the drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, on Sept. 17. He slammed the company for charging Americans more than $900 a month for Ozempic. According to Reuters , Novo Nordisk sells Wegovy for $1,349 a dose and Ozempic for $935 a dose. During a panel discussion with experts, Sanders said he and his staff have been in touch with executives of major drug firms. These drug firms, he continued, could sell a generic version of Ozempic for less than $100 a month and still turn a profit. A study published March 27 in JAMA Network backed up the Vermont senator's points. According to the paper, a month's supply of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be manufactured for an estimated 89 cents to $4.73. Given this, the study authors concluded that GLP-1 drugs ""can likely be manufactured for prices far below current prices, enabling wider access."" ""Novo Nordisk, which has made nearly $50 billion in sales off of Ozempic and Wegovy, charges Americans almost $1,000 a month – the highest prices in the world,"" Sanders said. ""Why? Excessive corporate greed."" According to his office, Novo Nordisk sells Wegovy at lower prices in other countries. It is sold in Denmark for $186 and costs $140 in Germany. Meanwhile, Wegovy – which contains the same active ingredient as Ozempic – costs only $92 in the United Kingdom. (Related: DYING TO LOSE WEIGHT: Study finds alarming link between popular weight loss drugs and increase in suicidality .) Reuters reported that the senator seeks to lower the price of Ozempic to $155 , which is the same price for the drug in Canada. Sanders ultimately warned that Medicare premiums could surge if the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy aren't reined in. ""Our healthcare system, I think most people understand, is in crisis. The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is unsustainable."" Sanders optimistic that Novo Nordisk will bow to pressure, lower prices According to Reuters , the senator for the Green Mountain State is confident that Novo Nordisk can be pressured to lower its prices for the two GLP-1 drugs by shaming it. ""I think the major thing that we can do, and we've done this successfully in the past with insulin … is to put a focus on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry in general – and Novo Nordisk in particular – in terms of them ripping off the American people,"" he said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson wrote a letter to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee chaired by Sanders in response to his remarks. According to their letter, the net prices of Ozempic and Wegovy have dropped since their launch. More than 80 percent of Americans with insurance pay $25 or less per month for the drugs, the Novo Nordisk spokesperson added. The spokesperson lamented that those savings do not make their way to the general public because of pharmacy benefit managers, who act as middlemen between drug companies and consumers. But according to the senator, the price drop wasn't enough. People paying that amount continue to be affected by the high prices because insurance companies still pay a lot for the drugs, he added. This, in turn, drives up insurance prices as well as hospital costs. ""It is very hard for any company, especially one that is making record-breaking profits, to defend itself when they are charging the American people many times more for the same exact drug than they charge people in other countries.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-cnn-bizarre-headline-vaccinated-dying-covid.html,CNN runs bizarre headline proving the unvaccinated were right: The fully jabbed are “dying from Covid-19”,"Fake news giant CNN is going through a metamorphosis regarding its position on Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) ""vaccines."" In the beginning, CNN pushed the notion that Covid jabs would save people's lives, but now the network is admitting that the shots are killing people – oh, but that ""doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective,"" reads a recent CNN headline. On Feb. 26, 2021, at the height of the ""pandemic,"" CNN covered a study out of the United Kingdom claiming that a single dose of Pfizer's mRNA (modRNA) injection is enough to provide ""strong protection for those who've had Covid-19."" A few months later, CNN claimed that people who got jabbed could safely go indoors without wearing a face mask. A couple months after that, CNN ran the following headline counteracting its earlier story to the contrary: ""CDC updates guidance, recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain areas"" After that, CNN was informing its readers that if they listened to the earlier guidance about getting jabbed for protection, well, that protection does not exactly last like was initially claimed. According to CNN as of Dec. 23, 2021: ""Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says"" Reminder: The unvaccinated were right! CNN's coverage of the vax started with how effective it is and ending with: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" pic.twitter.com/Yt22pg1wtG — Eddie (@Eddies_X) September 23, 2024 (Related: Earlier this year, CNN published a piece calling for the government to restrict how much Americans are allowed to travel abroad: ""carbon passports may be the answer."") Keep getting jabbed until you die – that's how you know it's working, says CNN Concerning the Johnson & Johnson injection, which differs from what Pfizer and Moderna offered, CNN told its readers and viewers who took it that the one-and-done format initially recommended by the manufacturer was no longer enough, as of Oct. 16, 2021: J&J jab recipients would now need a second dose as soon as possible. After that, Tony Fauci came out to recommend a third dose of whatever Covid injection you want, assuming you only got two jabs. And CNN parroted Fauci's recommendations as scientific fact. Then, not long after that, CNN was pushing people to take a fourth dose of Covid shot, this time claiming that the CDC said to do this. In other words, if Fauci and / or the CDC say to do it, then CNN wants you to do it. All of this culminated with an Oct. 19, 2021, article from CNN bearing the following bizarre headline: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" It is difficult to ascertain how CNN got away with pushing all this contradictory content all around the same time to its followers. Are CNN supporters schizophrenic just like the network's editorial team apparently is? Keep in mind that around the time CNN was publishing all these schizophrenic headlines, the federal government of the United States was busy changing the definition of terms like ""vaccine"" and ""immunization"" to fit the emerging narrative. ""They changed the scientific and medical definition of vaccine and immunization in late 2021,"" someone wrote on X about this. ""MSM changes any definition to fit their narrative like the definition of a woman etc.,"" wrote another. Another person joked about what CNN is actually saying with all of its contradictory content about Covid jabs: ""It went from 'safe and effective' to 'well, you'll die, but you'll go to heaven' at warp speed."" ""Four of my family members died from the vaccine,"" added another. ""Autopsy showed strange, horrible blood clots throughout their bodies. They were all previously healthy and under 40.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-fda-approves-monkeypox-vaccine-despite-acknowledging-dangerous.html,FDA approves monkeypox vaccine despite acknowledging that it is DANGEROUS,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a vaccine for people deemed to be at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, despite acknowledging that the injection itself is dangerous . The regulator approved the ACAM2000 vaccine on Aug. 29. The Defender 's Suzanne Burdick said in a report that the vaccine was made by Emergent BioSolutions, a company specializing in vaccines for biochemical warfare threats such as anthrax and smallpox. While ACAM2000 was initially approved for smallpox in 2007, the FDA's recent expanded supplemental approval allows it to be injected into those at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, such as members of the LGBT community. According to an FDA press release at the time of its approval , ""ACAM2000 is a ""live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine."" Even the regulator's medication guide for the injection admits that it may cause more harm than good. (Related: South African group challenges WHO's mpox emergency declaration, warns public about vaccine dangers. ) InfoWars reported that the first page of ACAM2000's medication guide provided by the FDA lists numerous side effects. According to the guide, the live vaccinia virus in the injection ""can be spread to individuals who have close contact with the vaccinated individual."" To make matters worse, ACAM2000 ""can cause serious complications in vaccinated individuals and in their close contacts to whom the vaccine virus has spread."" ACAM2000 does more harm than good Children's Health Defense senior research scientist Karl Jablonowski denounced the FDA's approval of ACAM2000 as a ""public hazard, not the practice of public health."" He told the Defender : ""You can call ACAM2000 a 'vaccine,' but its impact on the U.S. will be as a 'disease.'"" ""The spread of vaccinia virus is an infliction and an assault, as an unsuspecting person cannot possibly consent. For good reasons, you would not consent to this vaccine – even if you believed your benefits outweigh your risks – as you become a potential vector of a disease that is damaging to the heart and fatal to both fetus and infant."" Jablonowski continued that ACAM2000's package insert reveals that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found roughly 520 per million vaccine recipients who contracted post-vaccination cardiac inflammation – about one in 2,000. But elsewhere in the package insert, the FDA acknowledges that the risk is 5.7 per 1,000 vaccinations – about one in every 175 people. ""If the 262 million adults in the U.S. received this vaccine, an estimated 1.493 million would contract the serious adverse reaction of myopericarditis [i.e. heart lining and/or muscle inflammation],"" he remarked. Internist and biological warfare expert Dr. Meryl Nass said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also acknowledged the risk of cardiac inflammation in 5.7 per 1,00 primary ACAM2000 vaccinations during a June 2022 meeting. ""It's a huge number. The fact that the FDA and CDC are acknowledging it means no one should get the vaccine,"" she shared. ""Myopericarditis is a life-threatening condition; it lowers your life expectancy. This risk, 1 in 175, is higher than all other licensed vaccines for which the CDC acknowledges side effects. This is the worst."" Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough recounted that HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a monkeypox public health emergency in 2022, but let the declaration expire early in 2023. ""The crisis conjured up little fear for the average American as it was learned that the infection was largely a pustular rash that occurred with intense sexual contact among gay/bisexual men with the skin blisters around the anus and buttocks or mouth,"" he wrote in an Aug. 18 post on his Substack.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-ancient-healing-foods-remain-useful-modern-times.html,Biblical superfoods: Ancient healing foods are also useful in modern times,"Ancient scriptures and spiritual teachings, including the Bible, offer profound insights into how we should live and what we should eat. People in the Bible were even said to live beyond 900 years – with Methuselah, the longest-lived person in the Bible , dying at the age of 969. The Bible emphasizes that we should treat our bodies with care and respect, viewing them as spiritual vessels . Throughout its teachings, four key concepts emerge: cleanliness, good nutrition, fasting and exercise. What's even more fascinating is that many of the foods mentioned in the Bible aren't just symbols of faith, but are now recognized as superfoods for their healing and therapeutic properties in modern research. Could it be that we've had timeless dietary advice at our fingertips all along? Let's dive into the Bible's dietary recommendations and compare them to what we know about healthy eating today. You might be surprised to find that ancient wisdom and modern science agree on the health-supporting power of these biblical superfoods. Bitter herbs: Nature's digestive aid (Exodus 12:8) In the Bible, bitter herbs like maror are mentioned during the Passover Seder meal. While their bitterness might make them a challenge for some, it is worth developing a taste for them. These herbs are packed with compounds that aid digestion and support liver function . Modern research shows they can also reduce inflammation and even help regulate blood sugar levels. So, don't shy away from bitter greens, like arugula or dandelion – they're like a natural boost for your gut and overall well-being. (Related: Use bitter herbs for optimal digestion and detoxification .) Fish: Brain food from the seas (John 21:11-13; Matthew 15:36) Fish, especially cold-water varieties like cod or salmon, is hailed as one of the healthiest foods on the planet. The Bible frequently refers to fish as a staple – and for good reason. Packed with high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids, fish reduces inflammation and supports cognitive function. It is also rich in iodine, which is crucial for thyroid health and metabolism. Modern research shows that people who eat more fish tend to experience slower mental decline as they age. So, when you enjoy fish, you're feeding both your body and brain! Flaxseed: The tiny superfood (Proverbs 31) Flaxseed might be small but they pack a punch – delivering significant health benefits as indicated in a study published in Healthcare . Known in ancient times as a source of nourishment, flaxseed is rich in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids – reducing inflammation, improving digestion and supporting heart health. Today, flaxseed is celebrated for their ability to lower blood pressure, regulate blood sugar and even combat free radicals in the body. Just be cautious and don't overdo it – too many can have a powerful laxative effect and might result in an overly active digestive system! Grapes: The anti-aging superfruit (Deuteronomy 23:24; Leviticus 19:10) Grapes are perhaps the ultimate anti-aging food mentioned in the Bible. They are rich in resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grape skins, which has been linked to longevity. Resveratrol helps activate the ""longevity gene,"" sirtuin, which plays a key role in cellular repair and regeneration, as indicated in a study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology. This compound is also being researched as a potential treatment for age-related diseases, like osteoporosis. Even wine, made from grapes, carries some health benefits when enjoyed in moderation. Pairing grapes with other anti-aging foods, like broccoli, cabbage and cucumbers, which boost nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) levels in the body, could be your recipe for long-lasting vitality. Honey: Nature's sweet medicine (Deuteronomy 8:8; Exodus 33:3; Genesis 43:11; Judges 14:8-9) Honey, often seen as a symbol of abundance in the Bible, is far more than just a sweet treat – it's a natural sweetener that never spoils. In biblical times, honey was a prized commodity, particularly because processed sugar didn't exist. All honey consumed then was local and raw, ensuring its high quality and potency. The honey of that era would have been quite different from what we commonly find today. Local honey is especially beneficial for people with allergies. Since bees collect nectar from flowers in the local environment, consuming honey from nearby hives introduces small amounts of allergens into the body. Over time, this can help the body build a natural defense, reducing allergic reactions when exposed to the same allergens in the future. (Related: Honey: The ultimate survival food that doesn't expire .) In ancient times, honey was valued not only as a natural sweetener and energy source but also for its nourishing and healing properties. Packed with antioxidants, honey boosts the immune system , acts as a natural antibacterial, aids digestion and helps manage blood sugar levels. Today, we recognize honey as a much healthier alternative to processed sugar – making it as valuable now as it was in biblical times. Milk: Nourishment for body and bones (Exodus 33:3; Job 10:10; Judges 5:25) When the Bible speaks of a ""land flowing with milk and honey,"" it references two of the most nourishing food staples of the time. In biblical times, people drank raw milk, which is rich in beneficial enzymes, probiotics and nutrients. Raw milk, particularly from goats (and sheep), is easier to digest . Today, modern milk undergoes pasteurization, which removes many of these beneficial components. Research shows that after heat treatment, pasteurized milk has less copper, iron and manganese. Raw milk is making a comeback for its health benefits. Goat milk (which is also mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs 27:26-27 King James Version) is easier to digest, especially for those with lactose intolerance – making it a powerful option for bone and gut health. According to a study published in Food Science & Nutrition , goat milk contains unique enzymes that help to reduce inflammation in the gut, which may benefit people suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions. Olives and olive oil: Disease-fighting and heart-friendly (Isaiah 17:6; Micah 6:15 and Deuteronomy 8:8; Ezra 6:9) Olives and olive oil have been a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet for thousands of years and the Bible frequently mentions their importance. Olive oil, particularly extra virgin, is rich in polyphenols and omega-9 fatty acids that support heart health, lower cholesterol and even fight harmful bacteria and viruses. The oil polyphenolic compounds (hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and their derivatives – potent antioxidants displaying angiogenic, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties ) help protect the body from diseases, while the olives themselves are great sources of vitamins A, E, calcium and copper, which support bone and skin health. Whether you're drizzling olive oil on a salad or snacking on the olives themselves. you're consuming foods that have been healing bodies for centuries – for both the heart and the immune system. (Related: 8 Science-based health benefits of olive oil .) The foods mentioned in the Bible are more than just symbolic, they are packed with health benefits that modern science is just beginning to understand. From bitter herbs that aid in digestion to grapes that support longevity, these foods are nature's medicine – offering healing properties that have stood the test of time. Incorporating these biblical superfoods into your diet may improve your physical health and bring a sense of connection to ancient wisdom.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-garlic-roto-rooter-for-the-arteries.html,Garlic: Roto-rooter for the arteries?,"One of the most common kitchen staples could prove to also be one of the most effective natural treatments for heart disease (Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com ) Heart disease is the #1 killer in the modern world. It's the reason why millions pop aspirin, blood pressure, or statin drugs daily in the hopes that they might reduce the risk of a sudden and premature death. But pharmaceutical approaches to prevention carry with them such profound health risks that, in most cases, the jury is still out as to whether they do more good than harm . Here at GreenMedInfo.health , we have a strong belief (and therefore bias) that natural substances are superior to synthetic ones in preventing and treating health problems. We also focus on bringing to light research on the unintended, adverse effects of these commonly employed pharmaceutical interventions, as they are underreported in popular media. That said, as an ""evidence-based"" platform we make a concerted effort to defer to the authority of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, which when closely inspected, lends remarkably consistent support to our core advocacies. You can view literally thousands of studies we have gathered on natural ways to prevent and sometimes reverse heart disease via our newly redesigned Research Dashboard by searching any number of over 10,000 categories, from arterial calcification to high blood pressure to heart attack. Why The Drugs (Patented Chemicals) Won't Work A quick word about commonly ingested and putatively heart-friendly drugs for the primary prevention of heart disease… First, let's acknowledge that heart disease is not caused by a lack of a drug. This point is so obvious that it often seems to escape the attention it deserves. To the contrary, it is exposure to tens of thousands of chemicals (many of them drugs) that did not pre-exist the industrial revolution in the late 19th century that is one of the major, if not the primary reason why we have a heart disease epidemic. Of course, nutritional and lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) play a huge role, but being exposed to chemicals and drugs that shouldn't be in the body (outside their occasional use in emergency medicine where they can be life-saving) is a sorely underreported part of the puzzle. Aspirin, for instance, has been linked to over 50 serious side effects , the top 7 of which we documented in our previous report, The Evidence Against Aspirin and For Natural Alternatives . Statin drugs are even worse. Not only are the statistics manipulated to make them seem far more effective than they actually are, but we have identified over 300 adverse health effects linked to their use . Should we be surprised? The body is comprised, molecule by molecule, cell by cell, of natural substances not synthetic ones. Therefore what's not natural is perceived by the body as xenobiotic (""foreign to life""), rejected if possible, but almost always leadsing to a wide range of adverse effects that are at the root of many health conditions that are, in turn, treated with more chemicals to suppress or mask the symptoms of chemical poisoning. It's a truly vicious cycle. Some call it the medical merry-go-round . Why Garlic May Save Your Heart (And Your Life) Given the uncertainty that comes with taking pharmaceuticals -- basically patented chemicals, ostensibly to ""improve health"" or ""reduce disease risks"" -- natural alternatives are receiving far greater attention today than ever before. And rightfully so! Literally thousands of years of cross-culturally confirmed positive experience is backing their use, including a glut of relatively recently performed scientific research. We've looked at a wide range of natural alternatives to drugs for heart disease in previous posts, with pomegranate , turmeric , and sesame seed demonstrating extraordinary cardioprotective properties, to name but a few. Garlic, however, may be the most compelling of them all from the standpoint of clinical research, given that numerous recent studies now show this amazing herb can prevent and even reverse the accumulation of calcified plaque in the arteries. This is, of course, the goal of root-cause resolution medicine: to address and ameliorate the underlying pathologies, instead of simply suppressing symptoms or surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk such as LDL cholesterol . Take a look at one of our previous reports on the topic of garlic's artery de-calcifying properties here . The most recent clinical study on the topic of garlic's heart-disease healing properties was just published in the journal Nutrition and entitled, "" Aged Garlic Extract Reduces Low Attenuation Plaque in Coronary Arteries of Patients with Metabolic Syndrome in a Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Study ."" It looked at whether or not aged garlic supplementation could reduce the volume of so-called low-attenuation plaque in the arteries of patients suffering from metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes a constellation of health problems, including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. This condition greatly increases the person's risk for heart attack and stroke, and often occurs alongside atherosclerosis. Although several previous studies have demonstrated that aged garlic extract (AGE) inhibits the progression of coronary artery calcification, its effect on noncalcified plaque (NCP) has not been clearly demonstrated to be effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The new study involved 55 patients with metabolic syndrome, with an average age of 58.7 and 71% men. They were divided into two groups (27 orally administered with 2400 mg a day of aged garlic) and 28 placebo. The intervention lasted an average of 354 days. The patients were maintained on current medications such as aspirin, hypertensive, or hyperlipidemia medication, and did not change medications during the study period. The results showed a significant decrease in low-attenuation plaque volume (-1.5% ± 2.3%), compared with an increase of 0.2% ± 2.0%, in the placebo group. Low-attenuation plaque is associated with ischemia risk (inhibited blood supply) in atherosclerosis, a factor in poorer prognosis. The clear conclusion of the study was that aged garlic prevented plaque buildup in the arteries. When compared to the increase in plaque volume in the untreated group, clearly the intervention has life-saving implications in that it actually reversed the progression of atherosclerosis. How does garlic work? The researchers surmised that garlic possesses a number of therapeutic properties that occur simultaneously to stabilize atherosclerosis. Those primary properties are: Cholesterol-reducing effects Blood vessel dilating effects (blood pressure lowering) Anti-inflammatory effects Antioxidant effects (inhibiting LDL oxidation) When you consider the diverse ways in which garlic expresses its cardioprotective actions, it is what you could call a ""poly pill."" For decades the pharmaceutical industry has been trying to reproduce the spectrum of benefits witnessed in natural substances with a patented chemical capable of doing the same thing. The industry has clearly failed. In fact, drugs like statins carry over 300 distinct risks for adverse effects. You can view the statin database on our website to see the evidence for this astounding evidence of its toxicity. We have additional research on our garlic database which reveals the cardioprotective properties of this remarkable herb. We have created a public page for 16 studies on the topic here , as part of our professional membership tool set functionality called ""create public page."" [Learn more about Professional features here ] Garlic is a powerful, time-tested, safe, affordable and easily accessible natural healing agent with dozens of documented side benefits . Those on medication, such as a blood thinner, should be mindful not to take it in ""nutraceutical"" concentrations without the guidance of a trained medical professional. For those who have opted out of conventional, drug-based approaches we can only opine that the best thing would be to let your food, and herbs like garlic, be your medicine, if you so choose to exercise your free will.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-epa-accused-retaliating-against-scientists-toxic-chemicals.html,Environmental Protection Agency accused of retaliating against scientists who voiced concerns about toxic chemicals,"A group of government scientists say they were pressured by management at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to present new chemicals they were investigating as being safer than they actually were. When they failed to delete evidence of the serious dangers associated with the chemicals, their managers did it themselves . The scientists claim that after pushing back, they were hit with negative performance reviews, while some lost their positions in the new chemical division and were reassigned to other parts in the agency. Last week, the Inspector General of the EPA announced their finding that three of the scientists’ treatment can be considered retaliation, confirming that their negative reviews and reassignments were retaliatory. They also concluded that the scientists being denied a work-related incentive that can be used to take time off or traded for cash was retaliatory as well. The report instructed the EPA to take “appropriate corrective action” as a result, including a potential three-day minimum suspension for supervisors who violated the Whistleblower Protection Act. In response to the report, EPA assistant administrator Michael Freedhoff sent a letter to the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention explaining that all managers would be undergoing “refresher training” on the Whistleblower Protection Act as well as scientific integrity in general and that their office would be reviewing the reports to see if additional action is needed. Further reports are expected to be released about the scientific allegations made by the whistleblowers. The three whistleblowers in question – Sarah Gallagher, William Irwin and Martin Phillips – maintained that the chemicals they were vetting for the agency could cause damages ranging from neurological problems and miscarriages to cancer. The EPA appears to be trying to shift the blame for what happened to former President Donald Trump as the incident took place during his administration. They say that the agency was under pressure to push chemicals through the approval process more quickly. “The events covered by these reports began during the previous administration when the political leadership placed intense pressure on both career managers and scientists in EPA’s new chemicals program to more quickly review and approve new chemicals,” the agency claimed. Whistleblowers describe retaliatory action after they refused to cover up dangers One of the whistleblowers, William Irwin, who possesses doctorates in molecular biology and biochemistry as well as board certifications in toxicology, says that he was transferred out of the new chemicals division after he refused to change reports, including one that cautioned about a chemical potentially causing immune, neurological and reproductive problems. Meanwhile, whistleblower Martin Phillips said that the experience was traumatic, from the hostility he received from supervisors to having his professional work changed and worrying about whether he should inform authorities about what was happening. “I’m worried about the future because there are groups out there pushing for changes to the civil service that would make it so I could be fired and replaced with a non-scientist,” he added. He explained that on one occasion, a report he wrote about a chemical causing birth defects and miscarriages in rats was deleted and replaced with another one that did not include this important fact. After asking for his original work to be restored, he found himself being reassigned to a different part of the agency and says he was “turned into a pariah.” “I lost sleep. I dreaded going to work. I was worried every time I had to meet with my supervisor or other members of the team. It made me question whether I wanted to continue in my job,” he told ProPublica. "

""The only way I could do this job for the city was if I had some way to blow off steam every now and then."" The internet is freaking out about this latest revelation. One X user wrote that it is quite damning for Varma and his friends to be exposed like this for engaging in drug-fueled orgies while regular people ""couldn't even sell stuff at home without police coming to their house."" In other words, while local citizens were being drained of their lives and livelihoods by the Covid enforcers, those same Covid enforcers were trading sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and possibly Covid itself with one another under the cover of darkness. ""Obama didn't care either,"" wrote another X user, referring to the former president's 60th birthday bash in early August of 2021. ""Covid was a lie."" ""I wish I had the video where the news people knew the camera was off. None of them had masks on and were acting like life was normal. Then the moment they knew the camera was turning on, all of these people ran together and put on their mask."" Another shared the following photo of Varma, whose disturbing eyes tell the story all by themselves: The eyes always give the game away. These people are psychopaths. pic.twitter.com/jFxSKJLAqT — Jeremy Carl (@realJeremyCarl) September 19, 2024 ""Meanwhile, my mother was dying, as were several of my friends' parents, and we were just praying to be able to visit them in the hospital,"" wrote someone else about the contrast between what Varma and his perverted friends were doing compared to what the general public was doing during Covid.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-decline-of-mortality-attributed-to-vaccination-highly-questionable.html,"The decline of mortality attributed to vaccination rates is HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE according to graphs of Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria and Smallpox","Nearly all pro-vaccination humans have one thing in common: They believe that the relative diseases and virus rates of infection for each vaccination significantly dropped after mass vaccination began, along with the chance of death from infectious diseases, and that vaccines have saved humanity from the worst infections on earth; however, they have all been duped. Real data and statistics, that the CDC, WHO, FDA and the Vaccine Industrial Complex do not want anyone to see, have been published and reveal that all the major infectious disease mortality rates were greatly diminishing and on a consistent downward trend BEFORE those vaccines were invented and mass administered. Several whistleblowers then and now have proof, but a few billion vaccine zealots still won’t be able to wrap their jabbed heads around it. This requires careful consideration and a total rethinking of everything we know about vaccine efficacy, infectious disease rates, and the entire concept of the so-called “holy grail” of medicine. Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Smallpox death rates all on massive declines prior to the introduction and mass-administration of those vaccines Take a good look at the graphs of these documented mortality rates in England and Wales from 1838 to 1978, well into the years that these ever-popular vaccinations were invented and mass administered to the populace. We see now, in plain sight, the mass illusion that was perpetrated on the public that vaccines were the saving grace for humankind, and saved billions of injected people from dying from the world’s scariest infectious diseases. In fact, vaccines and their efficacy were so overblown, that Big Pharma and governments around the world had to make them compulsory so the majority of the populace would comply. In other words, the brainwashing propaganda and faked science wasn’t enough to convince them all. The graphs even look similar for infectious diseases where there never was a vaccine created. That’s even more “proof in the pudding” that vaccines aren’t helping decrease mortality rates much, if any at all. It was really all about improvements in hygiene, plumbing, sanitation, use of clean water, and hospitals and doctors learning how to disinfect everything, including surgical instruments. Every human being on earth should be questioning the contribution of vaccinations to the decline of mortality in the world. We already know that nearly all prescription medications only “manage” the symptoms of disease and disorder, rather than address the root cause and actually cure the illnesses. Plus, prescription medications create a host of side effects and adverse events that bring with them new health horrors, only to be addressed with MORE crooked medicine. It’s a vicious cycle and a cash cow for Big Pharma, just like with vaccines. Pro-vaccine zealots love to scream “science!” when referring to why they believe so wholeheartedly in vaccination, but they should all take a look at the statistics of mortality from that science, based on infectious diseases and the relative vaccines that are supposed to prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent death. It’s all been a huge farce. Folks need to look at what really contributed to the decline of mortality over the past century and a half, and they will see it’s really about the rising standards of living. Vaccines may have contributed to this decline of mortality, but only in a miniscule amount compared to the propaganda and disinformation that’s been spread about them, around the globe, for decades. This now includes all the LIES about the safety and efficacy of the Covid mRNA clot shots .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-kentucky-governor-bans-telling-kids-dangers-gender-mutilation.html,Kentucky governor bans parents and doctors from telling kids about the dangers of genital mutilation,"Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued an executive order banning so-called ""conversion therapy"" for minors on Wednesday, September 18. The order makes it illegal to utilize state or federal funding to support conversion therapy programs for minors. The order provides licensing boards the ability to take action on licensees if they are caught conducting conversion therapy on minors. Previously, Beshear vetoed a bill prohibiting sex changes for minors. The Republican-dominated Kentucky General Assembly ultimately overturned the veto with their supermajorities. Beshear's order does not include a prohibition against sex change treatments. ""Kentucky cannot possibly reach its full potential unless it is free from discrimination by or against any citizen – unless all our people feel welcome in our spaces, free from unjust barriers and supported to be themselves,"" Beshear announced in a press release. ""Conversion therapy has no basis in medicine or science, and it can cause significant long-term harm to our kids, including increased rates of suicide and depression. This is about protecting our youth from an inhumane practice that hurts them."" Conversion therapy is the practice of clinically trying to stop individuals from being attracted to someone of the same sex and changing an individual's ""sexual orientation"" or ""gender identity,"" the order states. Louisville, the state's largest city, outlawed the practice in 2020 . Beshear's order covers the whole state. The governor's order cites a claim that leading mental health and medical organizations in the United States have spoken out against conversion therapy. Kentucky governor's order violates the rights of parents and stifles religious expression Several experts have claimed that laws prohibiting conversion therapy keep therapists from aiding individuals to understand their biological sex. The Family Foundation, a socially conservative group in Kentucky, stated Beshear's order violates the rights of parents and stifles religious expression . It mentioned the ban as an ""unlawful action,"" possibly signaling a legal challenge. (Related: LGBTQ CHILD EXPLOITATION AGENDA: Projects and businesses caught pushing kids into gender-bender drugs and genitalia-mutilation surgery without parental permission ) ""This order, like previous failed legislative efforts, is designed to promote false LGBTQ ideologies and muzzle Christian counselors, therapists and pastors from helping children struggling with sexual orientation or gender identity confusion,"" David Walls, the group's executive director, said in a statement. Walls added that their organization will ""continue to believe that parents and their children should be free to seek counseling that they desire to seek, including faith-based counseling."" While the order bans conversion therapy, it still permits minors to undergo sex change ""practice, treatment or intervention."" ""He can't just issue an executive order and prescribe law. This is really basic Con Law 101 stuff, and I think the governor knows it, frankly. He's not stupid, but he gets the headlines, and he excites the base,"" Chris Wiest, an attorney in northern Kentucky that is taking legal action against the order. According to Daniel Schmid, a legal executive with Liberty Counsel, which depicts itself as a Christian ministry, the ban runs ""roughshod over the First Amendment.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-fda-approved-monkeypox-vaccine-causes-death-vaccinated-unvaccinated.html,FDA-approved monkeypox vaccine causes DEATH in the vaccinated and can spread to UNVACCINATED people and kill them too,"It’s more than obvious that an FDA “approval” of a vaccine or prescription drug is nothing more than a rubber stamp paid for by Big Pharma without any clinical proof of safety or efficacy whatsoever. This could never be more apparent than with the recent ""FDA approval"" of the Monkeypox (Mpox) vaccine that has the most insane “serious complications” warnings of any jab, ever. Yes, the ACAM2000 is a live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine that, per the adverse reactions listed on the warnings insert, can cause severe disability, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, permanent neurological sequelae (long term infection), death of the vaccinated individual, and … wait for it… “ death of unvaccinated individuals who have contact with vaccinated individuals.” You cannot make this stuff up. Monkeypox vaccine can kill the vaccinated person, the fetus, and anyone who comes into contact with the jabbed human guinea pigs Monkeypox isn’t just for promiscuous gender fluids, prostitutes and porn stars anymore. Now, thanks to the Monkeypox vaccine, anybody who simply shakes hands or hugs someone who got the STD ACAM2000 vaccine can get Monkeypox, develop vaccine side effects and die. These are all listed as “serious complications” on the vaccine insert, compliments of the Freaky Drug Approvers (FDA) in the United States of America. Western Medicine couldn’t be more corrupt, adulterated, insidious and underrated as biological weapons of mass destruction. The creators should be put in prison for life. The propagators should be in the cell next to them. These are repeat offenders who all pushed the deadly Covid clot shots on the masses, and now the U.S. stockpile of these biological weapons exceeds one million doses. That’s one-third of the U.S. population. Do they think we’re all porno actors, prostitutes and orgy lovers? Exactly who does Big Pharma deem “at high risk?” Everyone? Kids? Babies? Certainly, Hunter Biden needs the Mpox jab right away. The ACAM2000 Mpox death jab (expanded smallpox-monkeypox combo jab) was crafted by Emergent BioSolutions, a Pharma Giant that specializes in vaccines for “biochemical warfare threats,” though it seems they’ve created a biochemical warfare threat instead of something to defend against them. Oops. So much for worrying about anthrax poisoning or smallpox infection. Americans have much more serious concerns, like getting injected with the ACAM2000, or some fully unvaccinated human coming into contact with a person that got jabbed with the ACAM2000. If you’re pregnant, it’s like an abortion pill you inject. It’s a wonder Kommie Harris’ picture isn’t right on the vaccine vial with the slogan “get vaxxed for the greater good!” This beast of a jab does not contribute to the safety of public health, but rather adds to the hazard of taking Western Medications that have ZERO proof of safety, efficacy or clinical trials with science-based evidence of the reward being greater than the risk. Plus, add myocarditis and pericarditis to the adverse events list for the Monkeypox freak jab, since it’s not enough to have those conditions already from the Covid clot shots. Talk about lowering life expectancy. That’s exactly what these dirty vaccines do. They create life-threatening conditions, some of which never go away until you’re six feet under. Of course, BioSolutions is part of the ethnic cleansing of African children, as they pledged to donate 50,000 doses to the so-called “mpox outbreak” in Africa. Sounds like the vaccine is causing the outbreak, not the prostitutes, orgy go’ers and porn actors.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-12-essential-oils-and-their-biblical-references.html,12 Essential oils and their biblical references,"""And they went out... and they anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them."" Mark 6:12-13 Throughout the Bible, oils held a place of reverence – serving both practical and sacred purposes. In the ancient scriptures, oils were more than fragrant substances; they carried deep spiritual meaning and were considered holy symbols of God's presence, blessing, favor and healing power. Here's a look at 12 essential oils and their biblical references where these or their related plants are mentioned. Not all references specify them as oils, but they are part of the biblical traditions related to anointing, healing and purification. These oils have stood the test of time and have become increasingly popular in alternative health and holistic practices. With modern science confirming their benefits, we realize the depth of ancient wisdom. If we only had known then what we know now about their full range of healing powers, their use might have been even more widespread. Calamus Exodus 30:23 – an ingredient in the holy anointing oil Acorus calamus, also called ""calamus"" or ""sweet flag,"" has been used as a flavoring in cooking and has a long history of medicinal use in many traditional herbal practices . The root (rhizome) is believed to boost sexual health; ease conditions like eczema, parasitic infections and rheumatism; help with digestion and reduce muscle spasms. In traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, the calamus has been used as an anti-aging remedy; to help with issues like epilepsy, leading difficulties and memory problems and to support mental health. Calamus has shown promise in treating cardiovascular disorders largely due to its high content of phenolic compounds. Research indicates that A. calamus may be beneficial for conditions, like coronary artery disease and high cholesterol – through various actions, such as combating oxidative stress, improving lipid metabolism, lowering blood pressure, preventing blood clots and reducing inflammation. Casia Exodus 30:24 – an anointing oil Ezekiel 27:19 – precious commodity Psalm 45:8 – a perfume for the king's garments Cassia fistula L. , also known as the ""golden shower"" tree, has been studied for its health benefits, including antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor and antioxidant properties. It has also demonstrated hepatoprotective effects. Cassia essential oil's spicy aroma also promotes a sense of energy and vitality. Cedarwood Leviticus 14, Numbers 19 – a ceremonial tool for cleansing leprosy Numbers 24:6, Psalm 92:12, Ezekiel 31:3 – a symbol of abundance and provision Psalm 45:8 – a perfume Song of Solomon 1:17; 8:9; Zechariah 11:2 – a symbol of security and stability 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, 2 Samuel, Ezra 3, Ezekiel 17, Jeremiah 22 – the choice wood for building the temple, currently and trading Steam distilled from cedar tree wood, cedarwood essential oil is versatile and beneficial for various uses , whether diffused or blended with other oils. In aromatherapy, it clears the mind, freshens indoor spaces, promotes relaxation, relieves tension and supports sound sleep. When applied to the skin, it combats dryness, controls oil production, shields against environmental factors and soothes irritation. In hair care, cedarwood oil balances scalp oil and supports healthy hair follicles, improving the feel and look of the hair. Cypress 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Isaiah 41 – a choice wood for building the temple, currency and trading Isaiah 44:14 – a fragrant hardwood and symbol of security and stability Isaiah 60:13, Hosea 14:8, Zechariah 11:2 – a symbol of prosperity Nahum 2:3 – the choice of wood for weaponry Derived from Cupressus sempervirens , cypress essential oil is known for acting as an expectorant and helping to reduce fever by increasing sweat and urine production. When applied topically, it can soothe coughing bouts and irritated airways, especially in cases of bronchitis. It may also provide relief from hemorrhoids and reduce foot sweating. Cypress essential oil is reportedly safe to use with children, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Because it is high in monoterpenes, it should be stored in a tinted glass bottle, ideally in a cool dark place or in the refrigerator, to prevent it from oxidizing. Oxidized oils should not be used on the skin but are still safe for cleaning purposes. Frankincense Chronicles 9, Leviticus 2, 5, 6, 24; Nehemiah 13; Numbers 5, 1 – a part of ceremonial offerings Exodus 30:34 – a holy ceremonial perfume Isaiah 60:6; Jeremiah 6:20; Revelations 18:13 – a precious commodity (potential currency) Mathew 2:11 – one of the gifts of the Magi to the Christ child Song of Solomon 3:6; 4:6 – a perfume Whether applied topically, consumed, or inhaled, frankincense has gained renewed interest as a natural supplement due to its wide range of health benefits. This aromatic resin, especially from Boswellia serrata and B. carterii , is believed to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, calming and pain-relieving effects. Studies support its use in treating various inflammatory conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, as frankincense blocks specific compounds and enzymes that trigger the body's inflammatory response. Frankincense also shows potential for easing conditions, like asthma, bronchitis and ulcerative colitis, due to its ability to reduce swelling in the airways and digestive tract. Some studies even suggest it has anticancer properties as it may inhibit the growth of certain tumor cells, including those linked to brain cancer and leukemia. Galbanum Exodus 30:34 – a holy ceremonial perfume Extracted from the resin of the Ferula galbaniflua, galbanum essential oil is known for its ability to stimulate blood circulation and detoxify the body. This makes it especially helpful for people suffering from arthritis and rheumatism as it promotes blood flow and helps remove toxins, like uric acid, which can cause inflammation and joint pain. It also eases muscle and nerve tension – providing relief from spasms in areas like the intestines, muscles, nerves and respiratory tract. Additionally, galbanum essential oil reduces scars by promoting the growth of new skin tissue – gradually replacing old scar tissue. As a natural decongestant, galbanum essential oil clears congestion in the airways, lungs, nose and throat – making it useful for bronchitis, colds and coughs. It also helps cleanse the bloodstream, which is useful in treating skin issues , like abscesses, acne and boils. By regulating hormone production, galbanum essential oil can balance sebum levels, preventing skin problems caused by excess oil. Hyssop I Kings 4:34 – mentioned by Solomon in his proverbs and sacred writings Exodus 12; Hebrews 9; Leviticus 14; Numbers 19; Psalm 51 – a part of ritual cleansing and ceremonial offerings John 19:29 - the sponge that soaked up the sour wine that was given to Jesus on the cross Six species of the Hysoppus genus are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes – traditionally to treat colds, coughs, loss of appetite, fungal infections and muscle spasms . Key components of the essential oils from Hysoppus include terpenoids. The plants are also rich in flavonoids, like well-studied apigenin, luteolin and quercetin, along with phenolic acids. The natural phytocompounds give its antifungal and antiviral properties. In addition, research has suggested it may relax the plasma membrane, have cytotoxic effects and produce a calming, sedative impact. While generally considered safe, more research is needed to fully understand its complete safety profile. Myrrh Exodus 30:23 – anointing oil Genesis 37:25 – a precious commodity – potential currency John 19:39 – burial preparations Nicodemus used for Jesus in the tomb Mark 15:23 – mixed with wine and given to Jesus on the cross Mathew 2:11 – one of the gifts of the Magi to the Christ child Proverbs 7:17; Psalm 45:8; Song of Solomon 1:13, 4:14, 5:13 – a perfume Song of Solomon 3:6, 4:6 – an incense Song of Solomon 5:1 – mixed with edible spices to be eaten Song of Solomon 5:5 – an ointment Phytochemical research reveals that Commiphora myrrh is rich in essential oils, as well as terpenoids . Its essential oils find diverse uses in aromatherapy, cosmetics and perfumery. Studies indicate that it can combat microbes and respiratory infections, ease pain, expel parasites, fight cancer and oxidative stress, lower diabetes risk, protect nerves and reduce inflammation. Olive oil Exodus 27:20 – used to fuel the lamps in the Tabernacle James 5:14 – Believers are instructed to anoint the sick with oil and pray for their recovery A 2021 review in Frontiers in Pharmacology , indicated that polyphenols in olive oil, especially extra virgin, boost the immune system by enhancing white blood cell proliferation and influencing cytokine production, which strengthens immunological resistance. Extra virgin olive oil's potent antioxidant properties reduce inflammation, protecting the liver from damage and preventing the progression of steatohepatitis. Additionally, the monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil, particularly oleic acid, may positively impact lipid peroxidation and provide hepatic or liver protection. Rose of Sharon (Cistus) Song of Solomon 2:1 – a reference to the ""Beloved"" Rose essential oil has been found to ease anxiety and depression and reduce pain. A study in the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research showed that children who inhaled rose essential oil after surgery experienced less pain – likely due to the release of endorphins, the body's natural ""feel good"" hormones. Rose oil has also been helpful for menstrual discomfort as a study in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women who received an abdominal massage with rose essential oil reported less cramping than those who used only almond oil. The oil also boasts anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties – helping fight infections, like Escherichia coli and Candida , which can cause yeast infections. In one study in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice , postpartum women who received rose essential oil aromatherapy, along with conventional treatment, experienced significant improvements . Sandalwood John 19:39 – burial ointment for Christ Numbers 24:6 – a symbol of abundance and provision Psalm 45:8, Proverbs 7:17 – a perfume Song of Solomon 4:14 – an incense Sandalwood oil continues to be prized for its calming and grounding properties . It is commonly used in meditation and yoga practices to promote emotional balance and mental clarity, as well as in skin care for its anti-aging properties. Recent studies confirm many sandalwood essential oils' use in treating colds, digestive issues and urinary infections. Sandalwood oil and paste for their cooling effects and to enhance beauty; its scent is believed to help relax and naturally uplift mood. Alpha-santalol, its key ingredient, shows potential in fighting cancer by stopping cancer cells from growing and causing them to die, though more research is needed to fully understand this. Spikenard John 12:3; Mark 14:3; – a costly ointment/perfume used to anoint Christ Song of Solomon 1:2 – a royal fragrant aroma Song of Solomon 4:13-14 – a prized, desired plant American spikenard ( Aralia racemosa L. ) has a historical background as a medicinal plant but modern research is limited. In 2011, the Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology showed that extracts from its roots have notable analgesic effects. Unfortunately, spikenard is critically endangered due to over-harvesting for essential oil production with its range of phytocompounds , including flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, saponins and terpenoids found in its leaves, after a chemical analysis done in 2016, as indicated in Pharmacognosy Journal. Spikenard essential oil is valued for its ability to address menstrual issues, muscular spasms, nervous tension, neuralgia, physical tension, sciatica and other stress-related conditions. It also helps alleviate anxiety, ease bodily congestion, improve aging skin and promote better sleep. Watch this video about essential oils of the Bible .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-trumps-tucson-rally-attendees-suffered-mysterious-symptoms.html,"Trump’s Tucson rally attendees who sat onstage suffered eye irritation, blurred vision and facial swelling","About 20 attendees of former President Donald Trump's recent rally in Tucson, Arizona, experienced a sudden and inexplicable medical illness, with symptoms including blurred vision and facial swelling , just minutes after the event finished. They had to seek medical attention immediately. ""Many supporters seated behind Trump onstage went to the ER after the rally with blurred vision and burning to the eyes. I spoke to several who still have not fully recovered. As many as 20 were affected,"" Arizona Globe journalist Christy Kelly wrote on X. Most of those affected were members of the group Latinos for Trump. Pastor Eli Moreno, who opened the rally with prayer, and his wife, Francesca, were among the most severely impacted. Moreno described mild discomfort, but his wife's symptoms were far worse. ""Her vision blurred, her face swelled up, and we had to rush to the nearest Walgreens for help,"" Moreno told Kelly. They later encountered another rallygoer with similar symptoms. Moreno added that the symptoms of his wife stayed for many days even after treatment at the hospital emergency room. She was later advised to see an ophthalmologist for further care. Five days later, she was beginning to feel better. Mayra Rodriguez, a former director of Planned Parenthood who made a notable shift into being pro-life, suffered the same manifestations. Just half an hour after leaving the rally, she was unable to open her eyes due to extreme burning . ""When I got to the hospital, they told me I had a chemical burn ,"" Rodriguez said. ""The emergency room staff, from the triage nurse to the PA [Physicians Assistant] asked are you sure you didn't get sprayed with something your symptoms look like you got sprayed with something."" ""Days later, I am still dealing with blurry vision and sensitivity to light,"" she said. According to her, the doctors were unable to determine what exactly caused the injuries. Her vision has started to improve as of Tuesday so her blindness does not appear permanent. Several other attendees shared similar stories as reported by the Arizona Globe. The same symptoms appeared roughly 30 minutes after the rally ended. A rallygoer used milk to ease the burning before heading to the hospital, while another reported his face turning red and peeling. ""The Trump campaign has been collecting information. We remain committed to the countless patriots that attend our high-energy, high-impact rallies across the country,"" Trump campaign Senior Advisor Danielle Alvarez said. Chemical exposure and UV toxicity are the possible causes, expert says Northwell Health ophthalmology residency program director Dr. Jules Winokur believes that what caused the symptoms of multiple attendees at Trump's Arizona rally may have been either inadvertent chemical exposure or ultraviolet light (UV) toxicity. ""There's no way I could know, based on the reports, what's going on,"" Winokur said, adding ""We need to examine people to see what's going on."" But since the symptoms were temporary, he theorized that ""there may have been a chemical, because that can irritate the eye."" ""Really hard to say, but it could have been some sort of chemical exposure,"" Winokur added. And chemical exposure, he added, ""Goes away, it gets better, and people heal."" According to him, alcohol-based products are often used in cleaning and alcohol is somewhat toxic to the eye . He guessed that there may have been cleaning products that were used heavily in that area, which then transferred to their hands. They may have rubbed their eyes and introduced something, he said. But he raised another possible reason, which he called UV toxicity, a condition that occurs when too much ultraviolet exposure causes inflammation on the surface of the eye. A potential hazard is if these lights were used at the venue. It's colloquially known as ""snow blindness,"" Winokur further explained. ""The sunlight reflects off the snow and if you're not wearing any kind of UV protection, you're getting an overload of UV. And that actually causes significant pain and discomfort."" He analogized the situation using pain welders who don't wear a protective UV mask. ""If they're welding without it, they often experience severe pain, with vision problems and their eyes running,"" he said. A third possibility could have been someone shining a laser pointer at the attendees, which he said ""could actually burn the inside of your eye."" But Winokur added, ""That would cause permanent vision loss."" The attendees have reported their symptoms are improving.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-23-respiratory-therapist-covid-patients-died-use-ventilators.html,Respiratory therapist says thousands of COVID-19 patients died due to irrational rush to deploy ventilators,"The rush to put COVID-19 patients on ventilators during the early days of the pandemic caused thousands of needless deaths, according to respiratory therapist Mark Bishofsky, who witnessed this phenomenon firsthand. Speaking to Good Morning CHD , Bishofsky recounted how he personally saw hospital staff intubating numerous coronavirus patients prematurely while denying them other treatments that could have been effective and came with fewer risks. “Many, many thousands of patients died because of this rush to early intubation and not allowing early treatment with medications like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine or even vitamin D — they wouldn’t even give these patients vitamin D. They just wanted to intubate them and put them on remdesivir,” he said. Mechanical ventilators work by pushing oxygen into people with failing lungs. They are first sedated before a tube is placed into their throat, and many people who received this intervention during the pandemic never recovered. He also claimed that their rush to intubate patients went against typical protocol, with some people being intubated despite needing just a small amount of oxygen. For example, he saw people being intubated for needing just three liters of oxygen, which he said is something he hadn’t seen in 25 years of practice. He explained: “That’s so little oxygen to the point where if you took the patient off of it, they’re gonna be fine.” The respiratory therapist conceded that ventilators are a crucial tool for saving lives, but they can also be “extremely dangerous” given their propensity to cause bacterial pneumonia. He said he spoke out at first, trying to convince doctors they were making a mistake. Intubation was always considered a last resort, he said, and the hospital didn’t seem to have a good explanation for why they were using it so much. High percentage of intubated patients passed away during pandemic Before COVID-19, he said there was already a 25% increase in mortality in patients who were intubated and put on ventilators – a figure that rose dramatically during the pandemic. “And now we know during COVID it was upwards of 80 to 85% of people that were on ventilators passed away,” he lamented. This unusually high death rate was something that was noted early on in the pandemic, and even mainstream media outlets like NBC News reported on it in April 2020. In one New York hospital system, 88% of the coronavirus patients who were placed on a ventilator died, including 97% of those aged over 65. Bishofsky also noted that his hospital gave patients hydroxychloroquine in the early days of the pandemic, which is something he said led to “extremely good outcomes.” However, this protocol was eventually scrapped following the release of an “absolutely bogus” study printed by the Lancet journal. He said that he later told his hospital’s medical director that the intubations were “hideous,” and the director agreed but said they did the best they could. He eventually resigned from his position when COVID-19 vaccine mandates were issued. He doesn’t think we should blame those who were on the front line, however, stating: “I think a lot of healthcare workers are getting a bad rap.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-23-cdc-admits-fluoride-toxic-to-humans.html,"CDC finally admits FLUORIDE is TOXIC to humans, especially babies, causing neurological damage, so why not remove it from all municipal tap water right away?","Casey Hannan, Director of the Oral Health Division of the Centers for Disease Control, who is responsible for providing leadership and overall direction, has admitted what the natural health advocates of America have been screaming about for decades; that the fluoride in tap water is causing neurological problems for humans, cognitive decline and lowered IQ , among other health atrocities. Now it’s on record, for all the naysayers and people who claim it’s just a “conspiracy theory,” and that the U.S. government and CDC would never allow a known neurotoxin to be put in the water most Americans consume daily. Here's Casey Hannan of the CDC fessing up to the known health atrocity besieged upon the American masses ever since WWII, when it began in Michigan, then spread across the country. Casey Hannan: “CDC agrees with NRC that it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the function of the brain and the body by direct and indirect means.” The CDC refuses to study the upper-level tolerance of fluoride levels for babies, toddlers, kids, teens or adults to find out how much is too much, as it is PURPOSELY dripped into the municipal taps of over 75 percent of America’s drinking (and bathing) water supply. Watch: Chemicalized tap water is a biological weapon of mass destruction the U.S. government has known about and purposely utilized against Americans for 80 years Back in 2011, The CDC issued a shocking report admitting 40 percent of American children showed signs of fluoride poisoning due to dental fluorosis. That sent a shockwave across the country, and they concluded also that sodium fluoride levels must be lowered in the tap water supply, so they reduced (instead of eliminating completely) the amount of this chemical poisoning compound per liter from 1.2 mg to 0.7 mg. without ever considering that infants weigh FAR LESS than adults, and most likely cannot tolerate ANY fluoride poisoning at all without suffering physical and mental health detriment. Are you making toxic infant drinks, tea, coffee, soups and drinking this toxin straight from the tap yourself? Fluoride also causes brittle bones , cancer and the calcification of the pineal gland in the brain. It gets worse. It was first used by the Nazis in concentration camps to keep the Jews weak so they couldn’t rebel or escape. Sodium fluoride is an industrial waste byproduct of the phosphate mining industry in China. To dispose of this dangerous, hazardous waste, the Communist Chinese label it “fluoride” and then export it to America. It's WMD, just like Covid spike prion mRNA clot shots. Wondering why so many Americans are brainwashed to believe that prescription medications are safe and effective? Consider the IQ-lowering medication that’s in their tap water. Wondering how tens of millions of Americans watch the dummy-box nightly news every night, read the newspaper every morning and believe that it’s real news about their world, safety, liberties, health and livelihood? The fluoride has them all dumbed-down and mind-controlled. By the way, there are ZERO recommendations, and ZERO safety limits suggested by the CDC, EPA or FDA regarding how much tap water a human should drink in a given day, not even for children, infants or pregnant women. Let that sink in for a minute. Tune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxins the U.S. government purposely allows in water and food, so the American people stay sick, dumb, broke and dying. "

During the ABC News presidential debate on Sept. 10, Trump criticized Harris for allegedly supporting taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for federal prisoners and undocumented immigrants in custody. Trump referenced Harris' response from the 2019 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questionnaire for the 2020 presidential candidates. ""Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison,"" Trump said during the debate. Health reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg fact-checked the statement in The New York Times live coverage of the debate. In the article, Stolberg quoted Harris' response from the ACLU questionnaire, confirming that she had really supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary people , including those in immigration detention and prisons. However, Stolberg wrote at the beginning of her article, ""This needs context,"" even though the additional context did little to dispute the claim. This, in turn, resulted in a backlash, with critics claiming that The New York Times understated the truth behind the claims. Conservatives online even mocked their decision to label the claim as ""needs context,"" despite the obvious. (Related: CONFIRMED: Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained migrants .) Meanwhile, Fox News contributor Guy Benson sarcastically posted on X, formerly Twitter, ""NYT: ‘Needs context!’ The context: It's literally her position,"" while conservative strategist Greg Price posted, ""Trump: ‘She wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison.’ NYT: ‘This needs context.’ The context: ‘Oh yeah, she actually supported that.’"" Media outlets immediately dismissed Trump's claims only to be proven wrong This case with The New York Times is not isolated. In fact, Trump's claims prompted immediate dismissals across various media outlets. For instance, Time magazine, initially labeled the claim as false. However, Time later acknowledged that Harris, during her 2019 presidential campaign, had filled out an ACLU questionnaire supporting taxpayer-funded gender transition treatment for detained immigrants. ""The original version of this story mischaracterized as false Donald Trump's statement accusing Kamala Harris of supporting ‘transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison.’ As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris filled out a questionnaire saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender transition treatment for detained immigrants,"" the correction read. Similarly, Ali Breland of The Atlantic initially dismissed Trump's assertion , likening it to something generated by AI parodying right-wing content. But then, Breland later updated the article, claiming that Harris had indeed expressed support for such policies. ""To be clear, in 2019, Harris did tell the ACLU in response to a questionnaire that she supports policies that allow federal prisoners and detainees to “obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained,"" Breland wrote in the update of her article. Meanwhile, Susan Glasser of The New Yorker quickly reacted to Trump's statement in a post-debate opinion article, apparently, without doing further research. ""His line about how the vice president 'wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison' was pretty memorable, too. What the hell was he talking about? No one knows, which was, of course, exactly Harris’s point."" Head over to KamalaWatch.com for updates on Kamala Harris' presidential bid.

Kennedy Jr. was asked by a member of the audience whether or not he agrees with the concept of utilizing the Presidential Reorganization Authority to create new parallel federal public health agencies to do what existing ones are refusing or failing to do. Kennedy responded by revealing that he has much bigger plans under Donald Trump to fix the existing agencies so they work for We the People rather than big industry. The young lady who asked the question told Kennedy that under the Presidential Reorganization Authority, the president has the power to divide, consolidate, abolish, or create agencies of the U.S. federal government by presidential directive that will operate parallel to the existing ones. Under these new systems, true patient care can be delivered that will render the existing systems obsolete, she explained. Here is how Kennedy responded: ""My initial inclination would not be to start a new agency. My initial inclination would be to use the Justice Department and the moral authority of the office.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-23-apple-collecting-mental-health-data-iphone-users.html,Apple collecting private mental health data from iPhone users,"If you use Apple products, be warned that the company's iPhones are collecting as much personal information about your mental health as possible from the data your device is constantly collecting about you. The iPhone Health app performs mental health assessments that are designed to probe the inner workings of users' brains. Under the guise of providing ""support"" for people's ""mental wellbeing,"" Apple instructs users to ""log an emotion or mood,"" as well as ""choose how you're feeling right now"" with the simple click of a slider button. Whatever you choose to input into the Health app is then sent off to Apple, which uses it for who knows what as it joins the rest of Big Tech in unleashing an Orwellian surveillance nightmare worldwide. ""iPhone mental health assessments not only ask questions about your mental health but can also infer the mental health status of family members, as demonstrated by the image publicly shared by phone on the benefits of a phone mental health assessment,"" explains Dr. Robert Malone from the Brownstone Institute. ""What could possibly go wrong?"" (Related: Apple is doing its part to unleash dystopia on the world with ""mixed-reality"" headsets and other Orwellian tech creations.) Apple probing users' brains with Big Academia's help Despite all its claims about protecting user privacy, Apple sure does collect a lot of sensitive information that, should it end up being hacked, would reveal a lot of personal and very private things that Apple users likely do not want going public. Consider what recently happened with CrowdStrike. A simple coding ""error"" resulted in a worldwide tech outage that grounded flights and unleashed massive chaos. Should the same thing happen to Apple at some point in the future, expect a similar or worse fallout. Dr. Malone says the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained access to ""all"" of the ""confidential data"" he submitted to both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) back in 2015 in order to obtain a security clearance. The Chinese government, he says, hacked into the U.S. government's ""super-secret"" and ""super-secure"" data storage site and simply took it all with ease. The U.S. government then offered Dr. Malone a credit report and free monitoring of his credit report for an entire year. Keep in mind that Apple is partnered with all sorts of health organizations and academic institutions linked to health-related research, including the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the University of Michigan . Apple also collaborates with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) on its Digital Mental Health Study, which more than likely utilizes the data collected through Apple devices like the iPhone to investigate mental health patterns and outcomes. ""Trusting that the user identifiers have been completely stripped before that data is passed on is a risk that one takes when entering such information into an iPhone,"" Dr. Malone warns. The reason why Apple does all this, of course, is because it is a highly profitable endeavor. Violating people's private lives is lucrative in that it allows unscrupulous corporations like Apple to sell more advertising about mental health services by ""connecting"" said services directly to people via their iPhones. One example of this might be that an iPhone user who is depressed receives ads from Apple for antidepressant pharmaceuticals and / or links and phone numbers to physicians who are desperate to prescribe them. ""The bottom line – no data is 100% secure, and this is mental health data. Data that might be extremely embarrassing, career-damaging, or has the potential to disrupt family relationships. Remember, no one knows what new laws, regulations, or more might come to pass years from now. This type of information should not be harvested and stored."" Nothing is private in 2024.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-22-covid-court-convicts-austrian-woman-fatally-infecting-neighbor-with-covid19.html,INSANE COVID COURT convicts Austrian woman of “grossly negligent homicide” for “fatally infecting her neighbor with COVID-19”,"A chilling court case in Austria sounds like it could have come right out of a dystopian novel. An insane, vindictive prosecutor and a compliant judge convicted a 54-year-old Austrian woman with “grossly negligent homicide” for “fatally infecting her neighbor with COVID-19.” The Austrian prosecutors argued that the woman came in contact with her neighbor in a stairwell and shared viral DNA, before the neighbor got sick with COVID-19 and died of pneumonia. This outrageous case sets a dangerous legal precedent, enshrining the germ theory as definitive legal doctrine, and making everyday activities subject to police state surveillance and prosecution. With this insane case, anyone with a damaged immune system can prosecute anyone they want, without serious evidence, for their own sicknesses and chronic diseases. Innocent woman gets harassed and prosecuted for coming into contact with a neighbor who eventually got sick and died The defendant in this case was found guilty of transmitting COVID-19 to her neighbor after they crossed paths in a stairwell. The prosecutor alleges that the defendant knew she had COVID-19, but left her home anyway. Trying her best to defend against the insane allegations, the woman said she had a case of bronchitis at the time. However, the prosecutors disagreed with her diagnosis and claimed she carried a specific virus (COVID-19) that ultimately killed her neighbor through some brief contact. When the neighbor became sick the following week, she and her family immediately blamed the 54-year-old woman for transmitting a COVID-19 virus. Sadly, this neighbor did not get the proper treatment and could not recover from her illness. She later died from pneumonia. The family, although grieving, should not have the right to pin the death on some innocent woman. This case shatters the legal principle called presumption of innocence, while appeasing germ theory insanity and ignoring the role of the individual's immune system in recovering from infectious disease. As the defendant was being prosecuted for living her life and breathing freely, the court ordered her to submit viral DNA samples. The deceased neighbor was also probed for viral DNA. The "" virological report "" suggested that the deceased neighbor and the defendant shared similar viral DNA. However, this bio-surveillance proves absolutely nothing, because anyone can share bits and pieces of viral DNA at any given time. Pathogens are ubiquitous. The real causes of illness and immune failure were ignored in this case. Court ignores the science of the individual immune system, enshrining germ theory as definitive legal doctrine There’s also no way of proving that this viral DNA was directly shared (transmitted) from the woman to the neighbor. Even if there was an Orwellian way of proving that the defendant transmitted viral DNA to her neighbor, how can she be held responsible for something that is completely out of her control? This is an inevitable occurrence -- randomly crossing paths with people, breathing freely and making contact with her immediate surroundings! How can she be held responsible for the poor state of health, the person's immune function, and the lack of proper treatment that the neighbor received? Does the defendant control the space and the air between she and her neighbors? Can she control the viruses and bacteria in the air she breathes or how they interact with her neighbors? Can the defendant control the state of everyone's immune systems? These things are kind of just part of living in a society or community. The ever-present nature of COVID-19, and the fraudulent use of PCR testing during the relevant time frame, makes it nearly impossible to pinpoint a single source of infection. Moreover, viral and bacterial DNA is a natural part of the human microbiome. It’s the various functions of the immune system that should matter most when determining the causes of disease. The terrain theory of disease was completely left out of the equation in this insane conviction. When the judge announced the woman’s sentencing, he acknowledged the unlikelihood of this being an isolated incident, raising questions about the fairness of singling out this particular woman, especially for something that’s untraceable, incalculable. However, the innocent woman was sentenced to four months of suspended imprisonment and issued an 800-euro fine ($886.75) for “grossly negligent homicide.” While the judge issued a sentence, the final verdict has not been determined. The final outcome of this case will be closely watched around the world, with potentially chilling ramifications for public health policy and individual freedoms that extend far beyond Austria's borders. If individuals can be held criminally liable for spreading a common illness, particularly with such loose evidentiary standards, it opens the door for a dystopian future where everyday activities carry the risk of criminal prosecution.

Dr. Jay Varma — New York’s senior public health adviser under Mayor Bill de Blasio from April 2020 to May 2021 — was the chief architect of the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates , lockdowns and bans on large gatherings. Using an undercover camera operative, podcaster Steven Crowder caught Varma bragging about how he broke his own rules: BREAKING: Former NYC Covid Czar Held Secret Drug-Fueled Sex Parties During Global Pandemic; Says New Yorkers Would Have Been “Pissed” If They Found Out Because He Was Running Entire Covid Response For City Dr. Jay Varma, Former Senior Advisor for Public Health, NYC Mayor’s… pic.twitter.com/YrgniDUdFc — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) September 19, 2024 Children’s Health Defense (CHD) CEO Mary Holland told The Defender , “It is outrageous to now learn that the doctor who fashioned NYC’s COVID measures completely disregarded them in the most flagrant manner.” Holland added: “Dr. Varma follows in the pattern of what we’ve learned about the disregard for these policies by other lockdown architects: Fauci, Pelosi, Newsom, and Johnson and Ferguson in the U.K. “This shows us that these so-called leaders themselves did not fear COVID while they induced fear in the public and imposed tyrannical and draconian restrictions on others. “The public needs to question all authority — especially in public health — and take these behaviors into account in future elections.” ‘If anybody sees me here, they’re going to be pissed’ Crowder on Thursday released video footage of Varma on his YouTube channel, garnering the attention of The New York Times . Varma confirmed to the Times that he attended three gatherings between August 2020 and June 2021. He added that although he didn’t dispute the recordings’ authenticity, they had been “spliced, diced and taken out of context.” The video footage shows Varma disclosing to an off-camera listener that he attended multiple private sex parties during the pandemic, including one he and his wife held in a hotel room in August 2020 with roughly 10 people who took MDMA , a psychoactive drug sometimes referred to as Molly or Ecstacy. Varma also discussed enjoying a dance party in June 2021 — “right when we were about to do the vaccine mandate, right before it” — attended by 200 people under a Wall Street bank. “We were all rolling, we were all taking Molly, and everybody’s high,” Varma is heard saying in the video. “And I was happy because I hadn’t done that in like a year and a half.” He admitted to being a little nervous that someone might recognize him. “If anybody sees me they’re gonna be pissed.” Joseph Borelli , the Republican minority leader of the City Council, told the Times that the video revelations undercut the COVID-19 measures Varma had pushed. He said: “I recall being treated like a pariah for pointing out the obvious at the time — that so many of our so-called leaders were just making up illogical rules as they went along. … Still, even I couldn’t have predicted how full of it they actually were.” ‘I was the one, like, making the decisions about what happened’ Crowder said in his podcast that Varma’s behavior isn’t just about the hypocrisy of leaders not following their own rules. He said: “This is a story about those in charge not fearing what it is that they demanded you fear in a way that altered your life. You were told to fear going to church. You were told fear meeting family, running your business — or even vote. Remember that?” Crowder showed a clip of Varma explaining that he largely hadn’t been afraid during the pandemic because he had had “control.” Varma said, “I was the one, like, making the decisions about what happened, so I didn’t feel like I [had] lost control. … I think that’s what really ends up freaking any of us out.” After leaving his city work in 2021, Varma became a professor and the director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medical College. Currently, he is the executive vice president and chief medical officer at the pharmaceutical company SIGA Technologies . Holland said Varma should be “rightly scorned for his policies and his behaviors ignoring them.” Varma told the Times he had been “targeted by an operative for an extremist right-wing organization determined to malign public health officials and take down the public health system in America.” “I stand by my efforts to get New Yorkers vaccinated against COVID-19,” he said, “and I reject dangerous extremist efforts to undermine the public’s confidence in the need for and effectiveness of vaccines.” Council member calls for investigation of Varma City Council Member Robert Holden called on Mayor Eric Adams to investigate Varma’s actions . It’s the height of hypocrisy to tell everyone to put their lives on hold while enjoying his own. #VarmaGate is real, and we cannot let this be swept under the rug. We need investigations.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-22-who-greenlights-mpox-vaccine-even-to-babies.html,WHO greenlights mpox vaccine for babies in Africa – despite no prior clinical trials,"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently approved the first mpox (monkeypox) vaccine for adults in Africa , the Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine from the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. According to the WHO, the approval will accelerate vaccine access for millions to reduce transmission and help contain the outbreak. ""This first prequalification of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa and in the future,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""We now need urgent scale up in procurement, donations and rollout to ensure equitable access to vaccines where they are needed most, alongside other public health tools, to prevent infections, stop transmission and save lives."" They can be administered in people over 18 as a two-dose injection given four weeks apart. After prior cold storage, the vaccine can be kept refrigerated for up to eight weeks in containers of at least 46 Fahrenheit or colder. However, it was also said that the vaccine can be used for babies, children, teens and pregnant women. ""While MVA-BN is currently not licensed for persons under 18 years of age, this vaccine may be used 'off-label' in infants, children and adolescents, and pregnant and immunocompromised people. This means vaccine use is recommended in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks,"" the WHO website indicated. Moreover, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization reviewed all available evidence and recommended the use of the said vaccine. Its Weekly Epidemiological Record report said that ""MVA-BN has not been specifically studied in clinical trials in children."" ""The same non-replicating MVA viral vector is used as a platform for other vaccines that include MVA-filo (Mvabea™) against Ebola virus disease (EVD),"" it said. ""The EVD vaccine is approved by the EU for adults and children aged 1 year and older. Data from five published studies on MVA-BN as a viral vector platform for the prevention of EVD, with a total population of 52,229 children, support the favorable safety profile of the product."" The authors of the study published in the BMJ presented results on MVA-BN's effectiveness in adult males but said nothing about children or pregnant women. The approval of the vaccine rollout did not sit well with vaccine activists as they questioned the safety of the mpox shots. Children's Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker called the WHO's approval of the shot for infants and children in Africa "" a train wreck in the making ."" ""The safety profile is abysmal in adults (up to 2.1 percent serious cardiac events in clinical trials) and the vaccine has not been adequately tested for efficacy or safety in pediatric populations. In other words, the WHO has no idea whether it will work nor do they know how much damage it will do. The WHO has again abandoned good public health principles and waved their magic vaccine wand on the mpox outbreak,"" Hooker said. Public health physician and biotech consultant Dr. David Bell also criticized the WHO for overly focusing on mpox vaccines and neglecting to address broader public health issues in Africa. (Related: German doctor says monkeypox is a SCAM – it's just COVID ""vaccine""-induced shingles under a different name .) Mpox vaccines from the U.S. reach Congo Some 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine from the United States arrived in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Sept. 10. The first batch from the European Union reached the capital Kinshasa, the center of the outbreak one week before. The 100,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine were donated by the EU through HERA, the bloc's agency for health emergencies. Another 100,000 were delivered over the weekend. The 50,000 doses from the U.S. will be of the same Jynneos vaccine. The next batch was said to be coming from Japan. Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of the country's Monkeypox Response Committee said that adults in Equateur, South Kivu and Sankuru will be vaccinated first starting Oct. 2. Since the start of 2024, there have been 5,549 confirmed mpox cases across the continent, with 643 associated deaths. The cases in the DRC constituted 91 percent of all the cases. Most mpox infections in the DRC and Burundi, the second-most-affected country, are in children under age 15. The DRC issued an emergency approval of the vaccine, which has already been used in Europe and the United States in adults. For the moment, the rollout will be reserved for adults, with priority groups being those who have been in close contact with infected people and sex workers, Africa CDC Director-General Dr. Jean Kaseya said. However, the European Medicines Agency is examining additional data to be able to administer it to children ranging in age from 12 to 17, which could happen at the end of the month, HERA Director-General Laurent Muschel said.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-big-tech-exec-warns-dangers-wireless-technology.html,Former Big Tech exec warns of serious dangers linked to wireless technology,"With Apple releasing its latest generation of iPhones this week, it’s important to keep in mind that the wireless technology in cell phones, tablets and other devices is not nearly as safe as we’d like to think. The convenience of being connected to endless information and communication tools is something few of us can resist, yet the price we pay could be devastating. Former Microsoft Canada President Frank Clegg, who currently serves on the Environmental Health Trust business advisory group and as the chief executive of Canadians for Safe Technology, has been warning for years about the dangers of 5G wireless technology, and he has been pressing telecommunications companies to prove that it is safe. In an educational video, Clegg shared research and data showing the potential impacts of wireless technologies on human health. “I’ve seen the tremendous benefit that technology can provide; I’ve also seen the potential harm if technology is not implemented correctly … I am especially concerned about our current implementation of 5G wireless technology, and the more research I do and the more experts I talk to, the more concerned I become,” he said. Clegg, who has more than four decades of experience in the tech sector, highlighted one fact that tells you everything you need to know about 5G: “I am not aware of a single study that shows that 5G technology is safe,” he cautioned. He also pointed out that more than 230 researchers and scientists from dozens of countries sent a formal letter to the UN and the World Health Organization outlining their reservations about the rollout of 5G wireless technology. The main concern is the fact that it gives off RF radiation, which the human body absorbs and accumulates. It has already been linked to a slew of problems via hundreds of studies demonstrating biological harm. A 2018 study by the National Institute of Health’s National Toxicology Program uncovered evidence of cancer and damage to DNA from the use of wireless devices. The technology has been linked to diabetes, infertility, headaches, insomnia, heart arrythmias and palpitations, and fatigue. It has also been associated with a number of mental health problems, ranging from autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to mood swings, depression and anxiety. Regulators aren’t doing enough to protect the public from 5G dangers You might think that with so much evidence stacked up against it, regulators would protect the public from exposure to this dangerous technology . However, Clegg noted that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is in charge of this important task, is actually composed of former telecommunications executives and engineers, representing a conflict of interest, while there are no doctors or scientists there. Another problem is the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, which bars telecommunication firms from being sued over the health or safety of their products. He believes these companies have long been aware of the dangers, and that is why they have hundreds of lobbyists working on their behalf to protect the industry. Moreover, the FCC’s guidelines are now more than 25 years old and have not been updated to account for the considerable advancements in technology that have been made recently. “And in fact, the telecommunications industry is self-policing, so what we are left with is almost a Wild West scenario,” he added. With people around the world increasingly acquiring devices equipped with this technology for everything from video conferencing to monitoring their home appliances, the situation could explode in the years to come. Clegg warned that public awareness of these dangers is desperately needed, and people must take the initiative to do something about their exposure. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-paxton-sues-biden-rule-hiding-abortion-criminal-investigations.html,Texas AG Ken Paxton sues Biden HHS over proposed rule that would hide abortion info from criminal investigations,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration's newly proposed rule that restricts access to medical reproductive health records from criminal investigations about women who cross state lines to seek abortion. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) modified the provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Historically, HIPAA allowed the sharing of personal health information (PHI) in specific cases, such as public health investigations or law enforcement investigations. But the new rule would limit the disclosure of PHI if it pertains to reproductive health care. (Related: Nebraska Supreme Court greenlights hearing of a pro-abortion ballot initiative .) The Biden administration claimed at the time that the rule would safeguard women's reproductive health privacy.' However, Paxton said the rule would only obstruct the ability of the state to investigate potential criminal activities related to abortion , such as illegal procedures or malpractice following the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . The 2022 Supreme Court decision overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the power to regulate abortion to individual states. ""This new rule actively undermines Congress' clear statutory meaning when HIPAA was passed, and it reflects the Biden administration's disrespect for the law. The federal government is attempting to undermine Texas' law enforcement capabilities and I will not allow this to happen,"" Paxton said. In turn, Paxton filed a lawsuit against the HSS, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and other officials of the Biden regime in the Federal District Court in Lubbock, Texas, to block the new rule. Pro-life advocates: HHS rule ""a solution in search of a problem"" HHS has declined to comment on the pending litigation regarding the rule but maintains that the regulation ""stands on its own."" They argue that the rule would safeguard the rights of women and their medical privacy. ""The Biden-Harris administration remains committed to protecting reproductive health privacy and ensuring that no woman's medical records are used against her, her doctor, or her loved one simply because she got the lawful reproductive care she needed,"" the HHS said. Supporters of the law also believe that the rule will prevent women from being targeted for receiving lawful reproductive care. However, pro-life advocates argue that this concern is unfounded. Texas' ""heartbeat law,"" one of the strictest abortion restrictions in the country, explicitly prohibits the prosecution of women who undergo the procedure. Section 171.206 (b)(1) of the law makes it clear that women cannot be prosecuted for having an abortion performed on them. Moreover, a June 2023 letter of several pro-life state attorneys general to Becerra criticized an earlier version of the rule and labeled it ""a solution in search of a problem."" They argued that there is no active effort to punish women who seek abortions, as the Biden administration claims. The letter also warned that restricting access to medical information could harm women by making it harder to hold doctors accountable if they perform illegal or unsafe abortions. Just like Paxton, the other attorneys general also raised concerns about the possibility of obstructing investigations into child abuse cases. They argued that the broad interpretation of ""reproductive health"" could make it difficult to access crucial information in abuse cases where reproductive health services might be involved.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-kansas-sues-pfizer-misleading-public-risks-vaccines.html,Kansas sues Pfizer for misleading the public about the risks of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,"The state of Kansas has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, accusing it of misleading the public when it comes to both the safety and efficacy of its highly controversial mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. According to the suit , Pfizer knew that its vaccine came with significant adverse effects and manipulated its safety trials in order to deceive the public, violating Kansas’s consumer protection laws as well as previous consent judgments. The suit cites a slew of supporting evidence, including scientific and government research, press releases, interviews, and news reports demonstrating Pfizer’s misdeeds. For example, they cited a paper from the New England Journal of Medicine and an FDA memo to support the allegation that Pfizer purposely destroyed the control group of a COVID vaccine trial by providing participants with access to the jab. This made it impossible to fairly evaluate the safety of the vaccine by comparing a vaccinated group to one that was not vaccinated, the lawsuit alleges. In addition, they cited two articles from the British Medical Journal indicating that Pfizer delayed the release of vaccine trial data intentionally and only tested healthy patients in its vaccine trials in a marked departure from what is considered protocol. To support their allegation that the company purposefully misrepresented the vaccine's safety, they included press releases from Pfizer and interviews with CEO Albert Bourla in which the vaccine is presented as safe and effective. The lawsuit also refers to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by the watchdog group Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency in America with the FDA, through which they obtained information about the vaccine. From this FOIA suit, the group acquired an internal Pfizer database listing adverse events that was never shared with the public and contained far more incidents than those listed in the public-facing Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. In total, the internal database showed nearly 160,000 adverse events, along with more than 1,200 fatalities among the millions of people who received the vaccine as of February 2021. Heart problems and pregnancy complications weren't disclosed to public The lawsuit also focused on specific health issues that have been coming to light since the vaccine rollout, such as heart problems. Not long after the vaccine started being administered to young people, it became apparent that it was having an adverse effect on their hearts, particularly young men. Myocarditis, which occurs when the middle layer of the heart's wall becomes inflamed, can weaken the organ and has the potential to cause heart failure. The lawsuit alleges: “Pfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine was safe even though it knew its COVID-19 vaccine was connected to serious adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, failed pregnancies, and deaths. Pfizer concealed this critical safety information from the public.” Another point of concern cited by the lawsuit is the dangers of the vaccine in pregnant women. It maintains that the company knew from a study that rat fetuses had trouble getting pregnant and implanting embryos and that their fetuses suffered malformations yet insisted to the public that the jab did not present any risk to pregnant women. The rat study was another revelation from the FOIA lawsuit, but the Kansas lawsuit also notes that Pfizer’s own data showed that tens of thousands of women experienced menstrual irregularities after getting the jab as of spring 2022. Kansas attorney general Kris Kobach told the National Review in an interview that the state's Consumer Protection Act is designed to prevent consumers from being deceived by companies like Pfizer. “They had extraordinary success marketing their vaccine in the state of Kansas and more generally across the globe, and I think that had consumers had this information, many of them might have made a different choice,” he asserted.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-sermon-049-grapes-gods-natural-medicine-nutrient-powerhouse.html,Sermon 49: Mike Adams discusses GRAPES as God’s amazing natural medicine and nutrient powerhouse,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams talked about grapes being God's amazing natural medicine and nutritional powerhouse in his 49th sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. He based the 49th sermon on a verse from the Gospel of St. Matthew , which reads: ""Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"" (Matthew 7:16) According to Adams, grapes are symbols of abundance and God's grace in the Bible, with the Father talking about grapes and vines as representing blessings and good things for humanity. The Bible nutrition educator noted that grapes are a nutrient powerhouse, with resveratrol being one of its most potent plant compounds. Resveratrol helps treat alcoholic fatty liver disease, reduce risk of bone fractures and slow the progression of lung disease. Resveratrol also addresses cognitive decline, improves cardiovascular health and prevents heart disease. It has also been found to kill cancer stem cells and lower breast cancer risk by blocking estrogen growth factor. (Related: Grapes: Versatile fruit with health benefits .) Adams cited a February 2019 paper that looked at the health benefits of resveratrol from clinical studies . According to the study published in Medicinal Research Reviews , resveratrol ""is reported to potentially improve the therapeutic outcome"" in patients with various health issues. These include diabetes mellitus, obesity, various kinds of cancers, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, kidney diseases and rhinopharyngitis. Given this, the Natural News and Brighteon.com founder noted that resveratrol may be the closest to a natural cure-all of any nutrient ever found in the world. Resveratrol's healing power also found in red wine The Bible nutrition educator also cited a study published January 2014 in Nutrients , which touched on flavonoids in red wine. According to the paper, these flavonoids from red grapes used to make red wine are the plant compounds most responsible for the ""French paradox"" – in which the French remain healthy even though they consume a great deal of saturated fats, thanks to their substantial consumption of red wine. The same study also found that flavonoids have cardioprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. Adams continued that gallic acid in grapes has been shown to possess various therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antiviral activities. The Bible nutrition educator mentioned that grape plants produce more resveratrol in the presence of natural molds or fungi. Plants that survive being attacked by fungi or bacteria end up being the strongest. These same plants produce powerful molecules that end up being beneficial for people. ""This is one of the reasons why permaculture or organic farming practices produce food that is so much healthier because in organic agriculture you're not spraying all these synthetic pesticides and chemicals on the plants,"" Adams said. ""You're letting the plants generate their own defenses as much as possible. They allow the plants to build their own defenses as much as possible."" He continued that ancient people were making wine – which is essentially fermented grape juice – and drinking this superfood about 7,000 years ago. The fermentation process involved in wine production makes the nutrients in grapes highly bioavailable. He advised people to take red wine as a nutritional supplement instead of grape juice, which is mostly fruit sugar. Adams reminded people that while getting good quality red wine is important, they should consume it moderately and enjoy it responsibly. He also advised people not to buy seedless grapes because many of the most potent nutrients are found in the grape seeds. Follow FoodIsMedicine.com for more news about superfoods like grapes.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-woman-injected-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-developed-psychosis.html,Woman developed PSYCHOSIS after getting injected with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,"A case study making the rounds on social media outlines how a woman injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine from AstraZeneca developed psychosis post-vaccination . The case study published January 2022 in Schizophrenia Research touched on an 18-year-old female student who was sent to the hospital for ""irrelevant talk and bizarre behavior."" According to the paper, she had no history of physical illness or substance use. In fact, she had been perfectly healthy both physically and mentally before getting injected. ""While there have been numerous pieces of medical literature on the neurological side effects of the COVID-19 vaccinations, they often revolve around more physical ailments such as lethal headaches and seizures, paralysis, Bell's palsy, Alzheimer's [disease], Parkinson's [disease] and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS),"" the case study noted, adding that the psychotic behavior exhibited by the woman would be classified within the category of neurological side effects. ""Over the period of [the] last few weeks, some of the serious side effects with various (COVID-19) vaccines have been documented in the form of GBS. There is limited data with respect to the psychiatric side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Few case reports have documented new onset psychosis after the use of messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) based COVID-19 vaccines."" (Related: The CONNECTION between AUTISM and COVID JABS could boil down to destruction of good gut bacteria .) The researchers ultimately noted in their case study that ""considering the limited data, in this report we present a case of new onset psychosis, following the use of [the] Covishield vaccine."" Covishield is the local version of the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm's vaccine, manufactured and marketed by the Serum Institute of India. COVID-19 vaccines are DANGEROUS, whether they're mRNA or viral vector-based ""There was no notable difference in the gender distribution between these two groups of vaccine recipients. mRNA vaccines (all brands) were associated with almost 90.0 percent of the cardiac complications, whereas viral vector vaccines were associated with slightly over half (52.6 percent) of the neurological complications,"" the study reported. ""Nevertheless, 5.9 percent of cases with neurological complications and 2.5 percent of those with cardiac complications were fatal, underscoring the significance of the consistent surveillance and vigilant monitoring of vaccinated individuals to mitigate these occurrences."" The researchers pointed out that other non-COVID-19 vaccinations have been documented to trigger psychosis as well. According to them, there are a few cases of post-vaccination psychosis linked to vaccines for rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus and influenza. For the 18-year-old woman in the case study, they attributed her post-vaccination psychosis to possible autoimmune encephalitis. Encephalitis is the swelling of the brain – in this case, being triggered by an autoimmune response to the vaccine. InfoWars recently reported that viral vector COVID-19 vaccines have a higher rate of triggering neurological conditions when compared to mRNA-based injections, albeit by a small margin. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 injections make use of mRNA coated in lipid nanoparticles to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines make use of an adenovirus vector. But even the two adenoviral vaccines have differences. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine received by the 18-year-old woman uses a monkey adenovirus, while the Janssen COVID-19 injection uses a human adenovirus.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-mulberry-tree-has-anti-inflammatory-anticancer-properties.html,Mulberry tree found to exhibit anti-inflammatory and promising anticancer properties,"For centuries, the mulberry tree ( Morus spp. ) has been a staple in traditional herbal medicine. While many are familiar with the health benefits and therapeutic potential of its fruits and leaves, the bark of the mulberry tree, particularly its tree root bark, holds a wealth of untapped potential. Traditionally used to soothe inflammation, protect the liver and kidneys and relieve pain, this humble bark is gaining attention for something more remarkable – its potential in fighting cancer. Recent studies have begun to explore how extracts from mulberry tree root bark reduce inflammation and may also have promising anticancer properties. (Related: The next big health marvel: Mulberry tames cancer, inflammation Alzheimer's and more .) Anti-inflammatory power of the mulberry tree Mulberry trees have long been celebrated for their medicinal properties and one of their standout benefits is their anti-inflammatory effects. In recent studies, extracts from various parts of the mulberry tree, including its bark and fruit, have shown remarkable potential in reducing inflammation. A recent key study published in the journal Molecules revealed that the ethanol extract from white mulberry fruits contains high levels of flavonoid and phenolic compounds. These natural phytochemicals are crucial because they help combat oxidative stress – one of the leading causes of inflammation. Oxidative stress is caused by an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the mulberry extract has been found to neutralize these harmful molecules – reducing inflammation at its root. In addition to neutralizing ROS, mulberry extract has been shown to inhibit the MAPK pathway – a series of signals within cells that contribute to inflammation. By blocking certain enzymes (such as p38 and JNK) that are active in this pathway, the extract helps to stop inflammation from escalating. One specific compound found in mulberry – rutin – also plays a role by targeting the same pathway but focusing on inhibiting p38. Another benefit of mulberry extracts is their ability to boost the body's natural antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione. These antioxidants are essential for protecting cells from damage, further reducing inflammation. Additionally, the extract helps to regulate nitric oxide (NO) levels in the body. NO is a molecule that, when overproduced due to infections or injuries, can contribute to inflammation. Mulberry bark extract helps to lower NO levels by controlling the enzymes responsible for its production, particularly in inflammatory conditions. Further research highlights the active compound oxyresveratrol found in mulberry trees . This compound has been shown to inhibit leukocyte (white blood cell) migration – a key part of the inflammatory process. Oxyresveratrol does this by blocking a specific pathway, the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses. In both laboratory and animal studies, mulberry extracts have consistently shown their potential as natural immune modulators, activating the immune system to fight inflammatory diseases. Mulberry's alkaloids, such as 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), have also been found to stimulate macrophages – a type of immune cell that plays a key role in inflammation control. Research also indicates that mulberry leaf extracts, when treated with high pressure, can suppress the production of inflammatory molecules like cytokines and nitric oxide. This effect further underscores mulberry's potential in reducing inflammation and related diseases. Mulberry tree bark and its role in fighting various cancers Mulberry tree bark, specifically from Morus alba (known as white mulberry and silkworm mulberry), is emerging as a powerful ally in the fight against cancer. At the heart of this discovery is morusin – a natural compound found in the bark that belongs to the flavonoid family. Flavonoids are known for their wide range of health benefits and morusin is no exception. Recent research, highlighted in a 2023 review published in the journal Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences , has shed light on morusin's impressive anticancer properties . This compound has demonstrated effectiveness against a variety of cancers, including those affecting the brain, breast, colon, liver, ovaries, pancreas and stomach. One of the most intriguing aspects of morusin is its ability to induce apoptosis or programmed cell death in cancer cell lines. This means morusin can potentially help eliminate cancer cell lines by triggering their self-destruction. While the precise mechanisms behind morusin's anticancer effects are still under investigation, it is believed that it interferes with crucial signaling pathways that tumors rely on for growth and survival. Breast cancer Research on breast cancer cell lines showed that morusin can induce apoptosis in these cells. It works by influencing proteins that regulate cell death, such as increasing the levels of Bax, which promotes apoptosis and reduces the levels of survivin, which helps cancer cells evade death. In simple terms, Bax is like a switch that helps decide when a cell should die. It promotes cell death when something is wrong inside the cell, such as DNA damage or stress. In cancer, cells often avoid death, which helps them grow uncontrollably. Increasing Bax levels in cancer cells might help make those cells die – slowing down or stopping tumor growth. Additionally, morusin appears to trigger other forms of cell death, such as autophagy and necrosis. Colorectal cancer Studies show that morusin can stop the growth of colorectal cancer cells and prevent the formation of cancerous cell clusters. It also targets key proteins involved in cancer stem cell growth – helping to limit the cancer's ability to spread and persist. By affecting specific molecular pathways crucial for cancer development, morusin holds promise as a novel treatment option for colorectal cancer. Gastric cancer Studies on gastric cancer cell lines have demonstrated that morusin can inhibit cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. It works by blocking the cell cycle, which prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing. Morusin also reduces the expression of proteins linked to cancer progression, such as c-Myc, and has been shown to decrease tumor size in animal models. These results indicate that morusin could also be a useful component or treatment strategy for gastric cancer – potentially enhancing therapies or providing an alternative option for patients. Glioblastoma multiforme Morusin has shown potential in targeting resistant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer stem cells (CSCs)– one of the most aggressive and deadly brain tumors because it contains CSCs, which resist chemotherapy and radiation. These stem cells help tumors grow back even after treatment. In studies, morusin was found to inhibit the growth of GBM cells and reduce the formation of CSC clusters. Morusin also triggers the death of cancer cells by affecting important proteins that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as increasing Bax and caspase-3, which promote cell death and decrease Bcl-2, which helps cancer cells survive. Furthermore, morusin reduces the expression of stem cell markers – leading to the CSCs becoming more specialized, which weakens their ability to cause tumor growth. Kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) Research indicates that morusin can stop the growth and spread of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. This type of cancer often starts in the kidney's outer layer and can also affect the kidney's collecting ducts. Morusin causes cancer cells to self-destruct by stopping them from dividing and moving. The bioactive compound affects signaling pathways that are important for cancer cell growth and survival. In studies with mice, morusin was also found to slow down the growth of RCC tumors. Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) Studies have found that morusin can kill liver cancer cells , particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, and reduce their growth. Morusin blocks certain pathways that cancer cells use to grow and spread. This natural compound also prevents new red blood vessels from forming, which tumors need to grow – making morusin a promising candidate for helping treat liver cancer. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Morusin has shown potential in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (a type of cancer that affects the nasopharynx, an area behind the nose and above the throat) by inhibiting the movement and invasion of cancer cells. Research indicates that morusin can block the expression of MMP-2 – a protein linked to cancer spread and poor outcomes in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). By preventing the activity of this protein, morusin might help reduce the risk of NPC metastasis. Prostate cancer In experiments on prostate cancer cell lines, morusin was found to reduce survival of cancer cells while sparing healthy prostate cells. The compound blocks a key signaling pathway (SRC/JAK2/STAT3), which is important for cancer cell survival. By suppressing this pathway, morusin triggers death of cancer cells by reducing proteins that help them avoid apoptosis. Read more about natural cancer fighters like mulberry at PlantMedicine.news .

Oil and extracts of boswellia have been used for thousands of years to treat numerous health conditions. (Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com ) While many of us are familiar with the meditative, cleansing, and enchanting aromas of incense, the very word itself contains the powerful natural medicine from which it is derived. Frankincense , meaning “true incense” is a resin that comes from any tree species that belongs to the genus Boswellia . Spreading their branches through the Middle East, Africa, and India, this tree’s roots run deep in ancient usage and text. While all boswellia species can produce frankincense, Boswellia serrata is the supernal species that is adorned in traditional medicinal systems like Ayurveda and Unani for producing exceptional extracts. Boswellia has a documented history of usage that dates back thousands of years, but it is quite possible this radical resin shared an evolutionary history with humans that greatly precludes our current estimates and archived paleoanthropological data. Just as fashion follows a circular cycle, with skinny jeans now the “newest rage”, so too is it time for a boswellia revival and resurgence. Currently, there are 30 clinical studies on pubmed.gov , and 28 of those studies used B. serrata (the other 2 studies did not list a specific boswellia species in their abstract). With a strong modern-day scientific backing, coupled with traditional use, boswellia is a bright beacon pushing contemporary usage of natural medicines onward and upward. A few of its best known therapeutic roles today include treating chronic health conditions like asthma , arthritis, cancer , and gastrointestinal issues. It has also been shown to reduce edema (swelling) from brain tumors after patients underwent radiotherapy [Kirste, 2011]. “RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group.” [Kirste, 2011] According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology in just 8 years (from 2001-2009), the prevalence of asthma jumped from 20 million people to 25 million people. That trend only seems to be increasing and if we extrapolate the data to 2017 there will be 30 million people with asthma, which is almost 10% of the population. Commonly used drugs, like inhaled corticosteroids or oral steroids may be effective, but at what cost? Serious long-term health consequences such as osteoporosis, cataracts, behavioral and mood changes, plus immunosuppression, are just to name a few [Dahl, 2006]. One of the reasons asthma is difficult to treat is because it involves an inflammatory enzyme pathway called the 5-LOX (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase). Through a series of biochemical reactions, this enzyme produces substances called leukotrienes from the oxidation of lipid substrates, predominantly from arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid [Safayhi, 2000]]. When leukotrienes are overly expressed, our immune system is excessively activated, and we enter a state of chronic inflammation, which can manifest as chronic diseases like asthma. One of the beautiful mechanisms by which boswellia exhibits its benefits is through the prevention of degradation and oxidation to these fatty acids, thus reducing the inflammatory changes in the first place. Boswellia has also proven to be efficacious in other chronic illnesses like inflammatory bowel diseases. Collagenous colitis, which falls under the IBD umbrella, is characterized by chronic diarrhea and is typically treated with a polypharmacy approach. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical study, B. serrata extract (BSE) was found to be superior in remission rates (63.6%) versus placebo (26.7%) after a six-week treatment [Madisch, 2007]. In a clinical study on chronic colitis, the remission rates were thirty percent higher in the boswellia group (14 out of 20 patients) versus the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical drug sulfasalazine (4 out of 10 patients) [Gupta, 2001]. In a clinical study on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy , a boswelia cream was found to significantly reduce the skin-damaging side effects [Togni, 2015]. Radiotherapy can cause extreme irritation, inflammation, itching, pain, and redness, which can severely alter a patient’s quality of life [Shaitelman, 2015]. Managing these disruptive side effects is typically done with steroids to reduce the immune response, but why risk the consequences when boswellia is a much safer alternative? While boswellia extract may be a formidable force, so too are the volatile oils (essential oils) derived from the gummy resin. There are four main species of Boswellia from which high-quality frankincense oils are extracted: B. sacra, B. carteri, B. frereana, and B. serrata. While the chemical constituents may vary by species, in general, frankincense oil contains beneficial terpene compounds (limonene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, camphene, myrcene) [Woolley, 2012]. Human data may currently be limited on essential oil applications, but animal and cellular studies have elucidated some of the mechanisms responsible for these anti-cancer properties. Frankincense oil has demonstrated cytotoxic, apoptotic, and anti-proliferative properties against various cancer cell lines, including pancreatic cancer (which generally has an overall survival rate in humans of less than five years) [Ni, 2012]. Without applying reductionist principles to the innate wisdom of this plant, boswellia probably has countless ways by which it improves health and restore balance. Whether you prefer a boswellia extract or frankincense essential oil - caveat emptor (buyer beware) - as the purity and efficacy of products can vary greatly.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-we-cannot-win-the-upcoming-world-war.html,"We cannot win the upcoming world war so be prepared for shortages and to protect yourself, your home, and your food supply","When one dares to criticize military leadership decisions that have nothing to do with actual war planning, inevitably liberals will point and screech that you are anti-military. That is their attempt to prevent you from calling out the ""woke"" idiocy that has become more important to our nation's ""leaders"" and the Pentagon than actually winning the war the U.S. has been instigating across the world. (Article by Susan Duclos republished from AllNewsPipeline.com ) We are looking straight into the face on World War III, and what is our military doing? Creating a "" gender neutral' submarine . Stars and Stripes explains in a piece titled ""First submarine fully integrated for coed crews to join Navy fleet next week."" The New Jersey is the 23rd Virginia-class submarine, but it is the first of its kind — designed from the keel up with specific modifications for gender integration. “The submarine community is a fully gender-integrated warfighting force,” said Vice Adm. Robert Gaucher, commander of Submarine Forces Atlantic. Modifications included obvious ones — more doors and washrooms to create separate sleeping and bathing areas — and some that are more subtle — lowering some overhead valves and making them easier to turn and installing steps in front of the triple-high bunk beds and stacked laundry machines. There are a number of things to take issue with here, including the cost of making these changes when we are trillions of dollars in debt, but this ""gender neutral"" submarine isn't really the story here, it is the fact that our government and the Pentagon seems more concerned with being woke, diversity and making changes, whether to this submarine, or the changes to the physical qualifications needed to join the U.S. military, or to funding ""transition"" surgeries for so-called transgenders . We have previously discussed the Army cartoon recruitment videos that made America a laughingstock around the world a few years ago, but for those that didn't see how the U.S. was represented to not only out allies, but to our enemies, a quick flashback video below showing our military recruitment video ad compared to one of Russia's. Also hindering the ability of the U.S. military to win a war against China, Russia or any hostile country which has their backing is a constant, year after year shortage in recruitment for all branches of the military. To put it bluntly, the United States of America does not have the manpower, the technology, nor the strength to win a war, and heaven help us all if any hostile country strikes us on U.S. soil. Yet here we are with the Biden (or whoever is really running the country) regime sticking our noses into every conflict occurring right now, from the Ukraine/Russia war to the Middle East .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-who-approves-monkeypox-vaccine-experiment-adults-children-africa.html,"The WHO approves monkeypox vaccine experiment on adults and children in Africa, despite knowing it causes cardiac events","As the World Health Organization (WHO) loses standing around the globe for deceiving populations with lockdowns, experimental vaccines and unlawful mandates, the corrupt behemoth has decided now to go all-in with a new experiment on African adults and children. The WHO recently approved Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN vaccine for monkeypox in adults, children and pregnant women, even though the vaccine is not licensed for individuals under 18 years of age and causes cardiac events in 2% of adult recipients. This decision has drawn widespread condemnation from public health experts and medical freedom groups who argue that the vaccine’s hasty approval reflects a dangerous and unethical approach to a manufactured crisis, with no medical precedent to necessitate its widespread use in populations. WHO unleashes the monkeypox scamdemic on Africa After multiple nations rejected the WHO’s pandemic treaty in the summer of 2024, and with a growing list of American governors rejecting the WHO’s authority ; the inter-governmental agency must act quickly and boldly, as they seek to remain relevant in a world of manufactured crises. What better way to remain relevant as a global terror organization than to sell Africa on a new monkeypox scamdemic? WHO will allow the nations of the world to unleash a new wave of vaccine experiments that will inevitably cripple and maim victims with new cardiac events. The WHO's endorsement of the “Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine, also known in the U.S. as Jynneos, comes despite significant concerns about its safety profile, particularly in pediatric populations and pregnant women. The vaccine, primarily designed to combat smallpox and monkeypox, has been authorized for use in outbreak settings where the benefits are purported to outweigh the risks. This approval is expected to facilitate the procurement of the vaccine by governments and international organizations such as GAVI and UNICEF, which facilitate mass vaccination of children living in the world’s poorest countries. Brian Hooker, Chief Scientific Officer at Children’s Health Defense, labeled the WHO's decision as ""a train wreck in the making,"" emphasizing that the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children and pregnant women have not been adequately tested. ""The safety profile is abysmal in adults, with up to 2.1% experiencing serious cardiac events in clinical trials. There is no reliable data on its effects on children or pregnant women, which raises serious concerns about potential harm,"" Hooker said. Dr. David Bell, a former WHO medical officer and current public health physician, echoed these concerns, criticizing the WHO for focusing on monkeypox vaccines at the expense of addressing more pressing health issues in Africa. He highlighted that approximately 40,000 children have died from malaria alone in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) this year, with similar numbers suffering from malnutrition, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. “We have become much better at detecting much rarer diseases such as mpox, and addressing these is certainly more lucrative for the growing industry feeding off the WHO’s misinformation regarding rapidly rising pandemic risk,” he said. Bell accused the WHO of prioritizing the needs of the pharmaceutical industry over addressing these critical public health issues, suggesting that the organization’s approach reflects a return to colonialist-era practices rather than evidence-based public health strategies. WHO approves monkeypox vaccines without clinical trials The WHO’s approval process for the MVA-BN vaccine involved a review by its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which noted the absence of specific clinical trials for children. The situation is compounded by the fact that the vaccine's use in the U.S. has been limited to high-risk individuals under the age of 18, with additional scrutiny recommended for very young children and pregnant women. This raises questions about the appropriateness of extending its use to broader populations in Africa without similar safeguards. The vaccine’s safety profile is not good , with recipients reporting pain at site of injection (85% of recipients); redness, swelling, itching, and induration at site of injection (40–60%); fatigue, muscle pain, and headaches (20–40%); nausea (17%), and chills (10%). There were also vaccine-induced fevers in 2% of recipients and cardiac events in around 2.1% of recipients. A WHO press release said the vaccine can be given to adults over 18 in a two dose series, spaced out four weeks apart. They also fast-tracked single dose vaccines “in supply constrained outbreak situations.” WHO admitted they need more data on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in these situations, but they approved it anyway. WHO admitted that “while MVA-BN is currently not licensed for persons under 18 years of age” it can be used “off-label in infants, children and adolescents, and in pregnant and immunocompromised people.” The WHO's recent decision has not only sparked controversy but also calls for a reevaluation of how public health interventions are prioritized and implemented, especially in regions with pressing health needs and limited resources.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-big-pharma-companies-penalized-for-illegal-activities.html,MEDICAL CRIME SCENE: Big Pharma companies have paid $33B in financial penalties for their illegal activities,"A 2020 peer-reviewed article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , which studied both the type of illegal activity and financial penalties imposed on Big Pharma companies between the years 2003 and 2016, has found that 85 percent (22 of 26) of them received financial penalties for illegal activities . They were penalized a combined $33 billion. The illegal activities included manufacturing and distributing adulterated drugs, misleading marketing, failure to disclose negative information about a product (i.e. significant side effects including death), bribery to foreign officials, fraudulently delaying market entry of competitors, pricing and financial violations and kickbacks. (Related: Follow the money: Most young doctors are financially enslaved by the drug industry, and it’s destroying American healthcare .) The biggest overall fines have been paid by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (almost $10 billion), Pfizer ($2.9 billion), Johnson & Johnson ($2.6 billion) and other familiar names, including AstraZeneca, Novartis, Merck, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, Sanofi Aventis and Wyeth. The study further indicated that many Big Pharma players are repeat offenders. Taking on Big Pharma is no easy feat Drug cases can drag on for years, and financial resources are needed to get a favorable verdict. Worse, if a case is won – Big Pharma brings the case to a higher court. One example is Pfizer's $35 million settlement after 15 years of legal maneuvering in a Nigerian case. The suit alleged the company had experimented on 200 children without their parent's knowledge or consent. Occasionally there is a case that lifts the lid on these corporate strategies, revealing the influence of pharmaceutical companies and the lengths they are willing to go to, to turn a profit. The Australian Federal Court case Peterson v. Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD), involving the manufacturer of the drug Vioxx, is another example. Vioxx was launched in 1999 and was used by up to 80 million people worldwide, marketed as a safer alternative to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs with their troublesome gastrointestinal side effects. Peterson argued that the Merck companies were negligent in not having withdrawn the drug from the market earlier than they did in 2004. By not warning of the risks and making promotional representations to doctors, they were guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct under the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974. According to Graham, before the approval of the drug, a Merck-funded study showed a seven-fold increase in heart attacks. Despite this, the drug was approved by regulatory agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia. In 2013, a settlement was reached with class action participants, which resulted in a mere maximum payment of $4,629.36 per claimant. MSD waived its claim for legal costs against Peterson. The pharma giant allegedly sponsored journals with renowned scientific publisher Elsevier, including a publication called the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine . These journals were made to look like independent scientific journals but allegedly contained articles attributed to doctors that were ghostwritten by Merck employees. The company made over $2 billion per year in sales before Vioxx was finally pulled from pharmacy shelves in 2004. Visit BigPharmaNews.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-carnivore-diet-risk-heart-disease-dementia-cancer.html,"Doctors warn: Meat-centric “Carnivore diet” may increase the risk of heart disease, dementia and cancer","Doctors are now warning that a new trendy diet, known as the ""carnivore diet,"" could significantly increase one's risk of developing heart disease, dementia and certain types of cancer . The carnivore diet, which focuses solely on eating animal products, has gained a lot of attention online, particularly among fitness enthusiasts who claim it has helped them lose weight and improve their health. However, some experts are raising concerns about the potential downsides of this restrictive way of eating. British general practitioner and nutrition expert Dr. Rupy Aujla urged caution about the carnivore diet and other low-carb diets, such as keto, which he warned could potentially cause inflammation and speed up the aging process. He referenced research showing that these diets might negatively impact vital organs by promoting the buildup of aging cells that lead to inflammation and toxicity. Aujla noted that the aging cells don't get cleared out by the body like they should and can result in widespread inflammation. He also pointed out that other medical professionals are worried that eliminating fruits and vegetables and relying heavily on meat could lead to nutritional deficiencies. A heavy meat diet might raise the risk of heart disease, high cholesterol levels and mitochondrial issues. (Related: Consumption of dairy foods, red meat and processed meat has varied health implications at key life stages .) He said this is concerning because it suggests that people could be increasing their chances of developing heart disease or even dementia. He did acknowledge, however, that for some individuals with specific dietary restrictions, a short-term trial of the carnivore diet might have some benefits. He concluded that overall, this diet could be dangerous, especially since there is not enough long-term research on its effects. Link between red meat and heart health It was long believed that the main reason red meat increases the risk of heart disease is due to its high levels of saturated fat. However, recent findings from the American Heart Association reveal a new concern: Chemicals produced by gut bacteria when digesting red meat could be a significant factor in increasing the chances of heart attacks and strokes. According to a report on NIH Research Matters , trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a metabolite created by gut bacteria as they digest certain foods. This substance is partly formed from components present in red meat. For years, the high levels of saturated fat in red meat have been linked to an elevated risk of heart disease , which is the top cause of mortality in the United States. Another major study on the matter by researchers from the University of Oxford in 2021, published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology , examined the risks of heart disease linked to various types of red meat . The study found that eating 50 grams of unprocessed red meat every day raises the risk of coronary heart disease by nine percent. Consuming a similar amount of processed red meat increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 18 percent. The researchers suggested that reducing the consumption of unprocessed red meat by 75 percent or completely avoiding processed meats could significantly decrease the risk of dying from heart disease by 10 percent. Link between red meat and brain health Researchers are now examining whether meat intake could also affect dementia risk. A 2021 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition investigated the connection between meat consumption and dementia risk in nearly 500,000 people from the United Kingdom. The study tracked almost 2,900 new cases of dementia, over 1,000 cases of Alzheimer's disease and close to 500 cases of vascular dementia. The study's findings suggest a potential link between consuming processed meat and an increased risk of developing dementia . The study also suggested that eating unprocessed red meat might be linked to a lower risk. These associations were independent of apolipoprotein E (APO-E) status – a protein connected to Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease. These results imply that there could be value in offering more tailored public health guidelines about the types of meat people consume. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that eating high amounts of processed meats may increase the risk of dementia. Link between red meat and cancer It's been well-established that eating plenty of processed meat (and possibly red meat) can increase the risk of certain types of cancer. One significant study adding to the body of evidence supporting this also comes from Oxford. This study from 2019 found that eating red and processed meats four times a week or more is associated with a higher risk of bowel cancer compared to eating these meats twice a week. Additionally, consuming just one slice of processed meat per day can elevate the risk of colon cancer . Processed meats, often loaded with salt and other additives, are particularly harmful and should be minimized or avoided altogether. The World Health Organization has classified red and processed meats (including bacon, frankfurters, ham and salami) as "" carcinogenic to humans "" – putting them in the same category as exposure to harmful pollutants and smoking. For better overall health , it is advisable to follow a diet rich in lean meats like fish and poultry and focus on diets rich in organic fruits, vegetables, whole grains and plant-based proteins like legumes, nuts and seeds – making red meat more of an occasional treat rather than the main component of meals.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-ncla-sues-government-social-media-giants-censorship.html,NCLA sues federal government and social media giants for censoring vaccine injury testimonials,"The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) has filed a lawsuit against federal agencies and major social media platforms , carefully documenting a conspiracy to suppress the voices of individuals who have suffered adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. The lawsuit, Dressen, et al. v. Flaherty, et al. , centers around the experiences of six plaintiffs who reported severe side effects after receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. These include Brianne Dressen, Shaun Barcavage, Kristi Dobbs, Nikki Holland, Suzanna Newell and Ernest Ramirez. Ramirez's case is particularly tragic, as his son died five days after receiving the vaccine. The plaintiffs' vaccine injury testimonials essentially represent the stories of millions of others, who were also harmed. The NCLA documents how federal agencies, including the White House, the CDC and the Surgeon General's Office, pressured social media companies to remove and discredit posts and discussions about vaccine injuries. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against this alleged state-sponsored censorship, asserting that such actions violate the First Amendment rights to free speech and association. The NCLA contends that these suppression efforts not only infringe upon the plaintiffs’ rights but also stifle crucial discussions regarding vaccine safety and individual health autonomy. The following points are discussed in the lawsuit, with accompanying citations: Censorship of Personal Experiences: Plaintiffs reported instances where their posts detailing personal medical experiences after receiving the Covid vaccine were flagged or removed as ""misinformation. "" Removal of Support Groups: Private support groups for vaccine-injured individuals were shut down by Facebook at the request of government officials, restricting their ability to connect and share information. Shadow Banning: Plaintiffs experienced shadow banning on social media platforms, limiting the visibility of their posts and comments related to vaccine-related injuries. Warnings for “False Information”: Posts that contained personal anecdotes about vaccine injuries received warnings from social media platforms labeling them as false information. Removal of Fundraising Campaigns: GoFundMe account for Mr. Ramirez, aimed at raising awareness for his lost son, was removed for violating the platform's terms of service. Invasive Monitoring: The CDC engaged in monitoring discussions within private Facebook groups about vaccine injuries, leading to flagged content based on government-defined misinformation. Suppression of Documentaries: Videos discussing vaccine injuries and featuring plaintiffs were removed from platforms like YouTube and Vimeo as “medical misinformation,” despite being based on personal testimonials. Legislative Threats: Government officials reportedly threatened to withdraw Section 230 protections from social media companies unless they increased censorship of vaccine-related speech. Direct Requests for Censorship: Emails and communications from White House officials explicitly requested the removal of posts from individual users sharing their vaccine injury testimonials. No Appeal Process: When plaintiffs appealed the removals of their posts, they received vague or no explanations, making it challenging to address perceived censorship. Removal of Established Support Content: Scientific articles or news pieces shared by plaintiffs regarding vaccine side effects were flagged or removed for allegedly spreading misinformation. Conditional Access to Features: Platforms like Facebook threatened to reduce the reach of plaintiffs’ posts if they were found to share misinformation, creating a chilling effect of self-censorship. Preemptive Censorship: Social media companies admitted to proactively censoring content that did not inherently violate their policies but was deemed potentially harmful by government standards. Content Removal Without Clear Grounds: Posts were taken down for vague reasons such as “potential spam” or “violating community standards,” without specific detailing of the offending content. Restrictive Algorithms: Social media companies adjusted algorithms based on government pressure to limit the reach of posts that could be deemed vaccine-hesitant or critical of government mandates. Use of Code Words: Plaintiffs felt compelled to use code words in discussions about vaccines and side effects to avoid censorship, indicating a restriction on their free speech. Public Discrediting: The Surgeon General and other officials publicly labeled social media platforms as “dangerous” for failing to censor enough content, creating societal stigma for plaintiffs. Quasi-Government Pressure: The coordination between the Virality Project and social media companies to suppress content represented a form of collusion that directly attacked plaintiffs’ rights. Loss of Donations: The inability of Mr. Ramirez to raise funds through GoFundMe due to platform removal of his campaign constituted a suppression of his ability to speak about his tragic experience. Impact on Mental Health: The overall atmosphere of censorship and suppression led to heightened feelings of depression and isolation among the plaintiffs as they struggled to find a community to support their experiences. The plaintiffs have faced relentless censorship on social media platforms where they sought support and shared information about their experiences. Their attempts to create and maintain private online groups dedicated to discussing vaccine injuries and potential treatments were met with content flags, removals, and the outright shutdown of their communities. ""This is a case that exemplifies the Orwellian consequences that take place when the government evades its restraint,"" said Casey Norman, Litigation Counsel at NCLA. ""The time has come for the federal government and its private partners in this cruel censorship scheme to be held to account for the ongoing harm that they have caused.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-sermon-012-apricot-kernels-anti-cancer-treatment.html,Sermon 12: Mike Adams discusses the use of APRICOT KERNELS as an ANTI-CANCER treatment,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams talked about the use of the apricot kernel as an anti-cancer treatment during his 12th sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. The Bible nutrition educator's sermon was based on a verse from the book of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. The verse reads: ""He found him in a desert land. And in a wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, he instructed him, He kept him as the apple of his eye."" (Deuteronomy 32:10) According to Adams, the late author and botanist Dr. James A. Duke wrote that apricots were actually not indigenous to the Mediterranean region, especially during the time of the Old Testament. ""They were not there. They didn't have apples, and so they referred to apricots as apples – and apricots are native to China. Apricot seeds were, of course, transported to the Mediterranean,"" Adams said. ""Apricots have long been abundant in Israel and were most probably introduced in biblical times."" Adams mentioned that apricot is relevant to God's medicine because it has a kernel, which contains a compound called laetrile or vitamin B17. However, Duke reportedly warned that the apricot kernel contains a toxic compound called hydrogen cyanide – commonly called prussic acid. He noted that laetrile is a compound that can either cure or kill depending on the dosage. Duke also mentioned that the kernel produces an edible oil that is sometimes used as an almond oil substitute. Apricot seeds are also used like almonds in Afghanistan, while the apricot kernels are used to make almond cookies or ground into flour in China. Adams shared that there are many drink mixes in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong that rely on either a combination of almond seed, almond flour or apricot seed flour. Some of these instant drink mixes are marketed for good health, he added. Laetrile in apricot kernels selectively destroys cancer cells in the body According to the Health Ranger, the laetrile story picked up in the 1950s and 1960s in the U.S. when San Francisco-based physician Dr. John A. Richardson began using laetrile to address cancer. Richardson's 1977 book titled ""Laetrile Case Histories: The Richardson Cancer Clinic Experience"" documented this use of laetrile from apricot kernels. G. Edward Griffin, one of Richardson's friends, also wrote about laetrile in his work titled ""World Without Cancer."" With the help of Richardson, Griffin laid out in the book the very compelling case that laetrile in apricot seeds selectively destroys cancer tumors. (Related: Apricot Seeds Kill Cancer Cells without Side Effects .) The Natural News and Brighteon.com founder added that many people have used apricot kernels as a form of natural medicine in order to prevent or treat cancer with the help of naturopathic physicians. According to him, there is something about laetrile that attracts it to cancer tumors. ""They have treated various diagnoses of cancer and laetrile has been described as a kind of naturopathic chemotherapy. It is apparently very toxic, or cytotoxic to cancer cells. But at the proper dose, it is not toxic to the rest of the body,"" Adams said. ""The cells take up the toxic components of the laetrile compounds. And then those cells end up killing themselves off while the rest of the cells in the body are okay. But then again, if someone were to take in a massive dose of this [laetrile], they could actually kill themselves. They could kill the whole body."" Adams stressed that laetrile is toxic at high doses, citing Duke's warning that a double apricot kernel is enough to kill a man. If eaten in excess the apricot fruit is believed to harm the bones and muscles, promote blindness and falling hair, numb mental facilities and injure pregnant women. Ultimately, the Bible nutrition educator issued a disclaimer that he wasn't offering medical advice or intending to replace a naturopathic physician. He advised people to research on their medical situation if they have one. Follow NaturalCures.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-prepper-fitness-10-tips-kickstart-fall-transformation.html,Prepper fitness: 10 Tips to kickstart your fall transformation,"As a prepper, you should prioritize your overall health and fitness. This is important if you want to be strong enough to lift supplies, accomplish physically taxing chores around your homestead, or run fast if SHTF. Even if disaster doesn't strike, being physically active can do wonders for your health. Here are some tips to help you start or continue your exercise regimen as fall begins. (h/t to HuffPost.com ) Figure out your fitness goals Start by figuring out your main fitness goals, then write them down. Do you want to improve your flexibility or your strength? Figuring out why you want to lose weight or become fit can help you stay committed and motivated to reach your weight loss goals. Commit to your exercise regimen According to research, people who make a public commitment are more likely to follow through with their goals . Telling your family and friends about your fitness or weight loss goals will help you stay accountable. The more people you share your fitness goals with, the greater the accountability. Be safe and alert when exercising outdoors Shorter days mean dark mornings and evenings, but this shouldn't discourage you from an outdoor exercise regime. If you decide to exercise outdoors, wear the proper gear so you can stay safe. Wear reflective workout clothes and bring a flashlight to illuminate your path. If you have a bike, invest in headlights and blinking tail lights and avoid heavy traffic roads. If you prefer an early morning or evening exercise routine, walk, jog or run at designated paths or go to the local school track. Appreciate the beautiful fall foliage while exercising Exercising will feel less like work if you are doing something you enjoy. When exercising during fall, try to relish the cooler weather and take advantage of outdoor activities before it gets too cold and you need to work out at home. Try researching park trails nearby and go on hikes or go on a bike ride. If you want to try activities that are fun for the whole family, go apple picking or pumpkin gathering with your kids so you can also burn calories while creating lasting memories. Wear several layers to stay warm The change in season also means a change in climate. Depending on where you live, temperatures could gradually decrease or drastically dip. Remember this while you're planning outdoor activities. You can also invest in breathable, moisture-wicking clothing. While you may feel chilly at the start of your routine, your body will quickly warm up once your blood starts pumping so you don't want to overdress either. If you want to go on cold morning runs, wear a hat to help insulate your head where you lose the most heat. (Related: Prepper fitness: 5 Easy exercises that can help you SURVIVE during emergencies .) Use the right gear You don't need to break the bank when it comes to fall fitness. Working out at home means you can challenge your muscles with your own body weight. But you might want to consider some useful items, such as hand weights or resistance bands. Try new activities If your typical exercise routine is getting boring, you can try new sports and activities like swimming or boxing. Exercise at home If you're too busy for an outdoor exercise routine, you can work out at home or somewhere in your homestead. Set aside at least 15 or 20 minutes every day, which is enough for a quick workout. When you have less than half an hour of free time, get in a quick workout and do aerobics in your living room or go on a walk around the neighborhood. Get a bike and try cycling If you want to try something more challenging, start cycling. New bicycle models are usually released in September and dealers will sometimes offer discounts because they don't want old models in their showrooms. Bike manufacturers make updates to new models. However, in some cases, these updates are minimal, so buying an older model is the better choice. Buy fall produce for less If you don't have a home garden, you can still enjoy tasty and nutritious meals by purchasing fall produce at lower prices. Visit grocery stores and farmers' markets for fresh fruits and vegetables such as apples, figs, pears, pumpkins, sweet potatoes and winter squash. In-season produce is very flavorful and cheaper than other options. Alternatively, you can stock up on freeze-dried fruits and vegetables so you have access to your favorite produce year-round. Where to buy supplies for your fall prepping needs The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you stay fit and healthy while you prep this fall.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-19-us-army-manipulates-covid-19-pcr-testing.html,US Army manipulates COVID-19 PCR testing of troops,"An Army Sergeant Laboratory Technician (position 68K) stationed at a Public Health Command has come forward to discuss the flaws with the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID19 testing technology and tell the truth about the high false positive rate artificially created by the directives to run the test at such a high number of cycles. (Article republished from TruthForHealth.org ) This courageous Sergeant has experience throughout the pandemic emergency declaration with testing clinal samples of patients and pooled testing in the public health setting. He discusses how the tests were never meant to diagnose disease. He also talks about the incredibly high false positives that occur when the PCR is run at the high thresholds that the CDC was mandating as lab protocol for the Department of Defense. This is quite alarming given the fact that the entire “pandemic” was justified based upon case rates of COVID19, but these tests were intentionally manipulated to increase the false positive rate, making the number of cases seem far higher than was medically correct. In addition, even the CDC and FDA’s own documentation clearly state that the PCR test cannot actually differentiate between COVID and other bacteria and/or viruses. Dr. Kary B. Mullis , the inventor of the PCR test who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, discussed with emphasis that no infection or illness can be accurately diagnosed with PCR. Dr. Mullis also talked about the limitations of the tests, “PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences,’ i.e., bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome. The problem is the test is known not to work . It’s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible, even if you ignore the other issues. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus-like COVID-19 is nonsense .” Dr. Fauci even discusses the tests being useless at the cycle threshold of 35 or more. He also explains that the standard “should be” 35 or fewer cycles. However, we know that there is no standard. We also know that the government was using 35+ cycles routinely. Furthermore, hospitals were receiving monetary incentives based on a person who was found to be “sick/died” with COVID19 after a positive PCR test. Given the fact that there is no standard for cycle threshold, hospitals could use 35+ to have an incredibly high false positive rate. It is critical to understand how significant it is that the PCR has been used incorrectly to create a false narrative causing more fear and more draconian measures to infringe on our freedom. The ENTIRE pandemic was based upon a positive case rate from these PCR tests. The death count was also based on a positive test, and a person who died “with” for “from” COVID19 was buried in the data. According to CDC COVID19 mortality data, only about 4% of the total mortality count died “from” COVID19 as the sole listed mortality cause. The rest (96%) died “with” COVID19 and had at least two or more other comorbidities. It has been widely reported that a person who got hit by a car or another completely unrelated cause of mortality was ignored as the cause of mortality after the individual or lifeless body tested positive for COVID19. It’s also widely reported that hospitals were incentivized for COVID19 deaths and treatments. Our whistleblower, who has tried to do the right thing by warning about these abuses of the PCR test, has been punished with an Article 15 UCMJ Non-Judicial Punishment after he refused to participate in the weaponized testing of the unvaccinated. He attempted to educate his leadership to no avail, and is now facing involuntary termination from military service after 12 years of honorable active duty. Listen to this bombshell Military Report episode as this laboratory whistleblower bravely reveals to the American public what our agencies and DoD leadership have failed to do.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-bill-gates-urging-people-avoid-vaccines-inciting-violence.html,Bill Gates says urging people to avoid vaccines is “inciting violence” and he wants “antivaxxers” censored by AI,"Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and former friend to Jeffrey Epstein, was recently interviewed by CNBC to discuss how to handle “vaccine hesitancy” using real-time censorship imposed by artificial intelligence (AI). Bill Gates said those who urge people to avoid vaccines are “inciting violence” and are therefore a threat to public health. He proposes a totalitarian approach, calling for speech “boundaries” that weed out “vaccine misinformation” in real time. Bill Gates wants to control minds and rewrite history on vaccines Gates’ “philanthropic” organizations are heavily invested in vaccines, from the traditional antigen-based biologics to the experimental mRNA jabs, which are linked to excess mortality worldwide. He recently announced plans to turn all vaccines into mRNA and expand the realm of vaccination to include hundreds more diseases and potentially thousands more boosters. Gates’ resume includes the mass injury of teenage girls via HPV vaccine programs in India and the spread of vaccine-derived polio strains through polio vaccine campaigns in third world countries. During the covid-19 scandal, Gates frequently appeared on the mainstream media networks, urging every person in the world to stay home, lock down and get vaccinated. He has proposed that individuals submit to his climate change proposals, too, which include: blocking out the sun using chemtrails , controlling global farming and ridding the world of cow farts, forcibly releasing millions of genetically modified mosquitoes , and getting populations to eat bugs and switch to fake meat . Now the prominent philanthropist wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time censorship of vaccine-related “misinformation.” Gates’ comments, made in a recent CNBC interview, have sparked a heated debate about free speech rights, mind control and the rewriting of history by the elite. Gates, who is deeply and psychotically invested in vaccines through the Gates Foundation, GAVI, and the World Health Organization , has increasingly focused on combating vaccine ""misinformation"" -- which is really just the suppression of vaccine injury testimonials and the abolition of informed consent. In his latest interview, he expressed a desire to impose “boundaries” on speech, particularly when it pertains to vaccines. Gates argued that while free speech is important, there should be limitations, especially if such speech incites violence or deters individuals from getting vaccinated. “We should have free speech, but if you’re inciting violence or causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries?” Gates said. He suggested that the U.S. might need new rules to address these issues, indicating a preference for AI-driven systems that could swiftly identify and suppress harmful content before it has a chance to spread. Ironically, everyone knows that the true purveyor of “vaccine misinformation” has always been Bill Gates, as he looks for ways to exploit populations with propaganda and force vaccine programs down people's throats to advance his ""philanthropic"" mission of transhumanism and population control. Gates’ totalitarian approach to AI is a threat to humanity Gates’ totalitarian approach could lead to excessive censorship and a suppression of legitimate debate, eroding informed consent in medicine and making a mockery of healthcare systems globally. Using AI to enforce Gates’ vision for the world will set a dangerous precedent, leading to broader restrictions on free speech, the uncontested implementation of vaccine passports, and further restrictions to the scientific method and the progress of human civilization. Gates’ AI censorship will prioritize thought control over public discourse at the expense of transparency, informed consent, and free will. Dr. Emily Carter, a free speech advocate, warned that Gates' proposals could undermine democratic values and erode the principles of our Constitutional Republic. “The idea of AI-driven censorship is fraught with challenges. It risks stifling important discussions and could lead to a situation where only sanctioned viewpoints are allowed,” Carter said. “This approach could erode the principles of open dialogue and informed consent, which are essential for a functioning democracy.” Gates’ psychopathic attempt to control people and bury vaccine injuries and deaths using AI continues a pattern of malicious behavior. Over the past five years, he has repeatedly called for social media companies to remove what he believes is “vaccine misinformation.” The so-called “ vaccine misinformation” and “conspiracy theories” that Bill Gates complains about ultimately turn out to be the TRUTH. His actions have negatively affected millions of lives in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of lives globally. People have been injured and killed all to push forth Gates’ false promises of vaccine safety and efficacy. Meanwhile, Gates continues to cash in on his investments, pushing narratives that have led to mass deception, injury, and death . His collaboration with OpenAI is apparent, as the vaccine propaganda stemming from their large language model is sinister and appalling.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-blood-thinners-leading-cause-er-deaths.html,Dangers of using blood thinners: A leading cause of ER deaths,"Blood thinners, or anticoagulants, are used to prevent blood clots that can lead to serious health issues. Doctors often prescribe blood thinners to reduce a person's risk of suffering from the following: Heart attack - occurs when blood clots block the arteries supplying your heart with blood. Stroke - caused by clots clogging the small blood vessels in the brain, obstructing blood flow. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - caused by the formation of clots in major veins in your legs (less commonly in your arms, pelvis and other large veins in your body); can become dangerous if the clots travel to your heart and/or lungs. Pulmonary embolism - caused by a clot blocking an artery in your lung, severely obstructing blood flow. Despite their intended benefits, severe bleeding from blood thinners like heparin, dabigatran and warfarin is now a leading cause of death in U.S. emergency rooms , according to a Duke University cardiologist. Blood thinners: a dangerous gamble Although blood thinners are a crucial medication for some, they unfortunately cause serious side effects. Blood thinners come in two main types: Anticoagulants These medications slow down blood clotting by interfering with certain chemical reactions in your body. The main classes of anticoagulants include heparin, newer direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists like warfarin. Warfarin, in particular, can cause severe bleeding in the brain, digestive tract and eyes . Other reported side effects include altered taste, bloating, gas, nausea, stomach pain and vomiting. (Related: Brain bleeding from use of anticoagulant increasing since the 1990s, researchers report .) Patients prescribed warfarin must be informed of its potentially dangerous interactions with foods, supplements and other medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, herbal products (like garlic and turmeric), vitamin K-rich foods, vitamin E and other anticoagulants and antiplatelets. (Related: Bye bye Coumadin, so long Plavix - Say hello to five natural blood thinners that protect against strokes and blood clots .) Antiplatelets These are medications that prevent blood cells called platelets from sticking together and forming clots. Aspirin is a well-known example of an oral antiplatelet, along with cilostazol (Pletal), clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), pentoxifylline (Trental), prasugrel (Effient) and ticagrelor (Brilinta). Injectable antiplatelets include eptifibatide (Integrilin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat). The most common side effects of antiplatelet medications include aspirin-induced asthma, blood in urine, difficulty breathing, easy bruising, low platelet count, nasal polyps, nosebleeds and severe stomach bleeding. Interactions to watch out for include alcohol, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids. Things to consider if you're using blood thinners Here are some key points to consider if you're on blood thinners : Avoid high-risk activities . To prevent dangerous bleeding, avoid activities that pose a high risk of injury. Discuss what activities are safe for you with a health care practitioner. Be cautious about using other medications . Some antibiotics and antifungals can make blood thinners more potent, increasing your risk of bleeding. Always consult with a health care practitioner before using over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Consider natural options . Talk to natural health practitioner about natural alternatives that could enhance blood circulation and reduce your clot risk. (Related: 9 Natural blood thinners you may already have at home .) Don't skip doses . Take your medication exactly as prescribed. Contact your physician for advice if you miss a dose. Using a daily pillbox can help you stay on track. Limit your alcohol consumption . Alcohol can lessen the effects of blood thinners by affecting your liver’s ability to process both the alcohol and the medication. Watch out for signs of bleeding . Symptoms like black stools, fatigue, pale skin and shortness of breath could indicate internal bleeding. Rapid bleeding may cause stroke-like symptoms or pain in your abdomen or back. Watch for other side effects . Blood thinners can cause nausea and low blood cell counts, which could lead to dizziness, generalized body malaise and shortness of breath.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-covid-propaganda-roundup-kansas-ag-sues-pfizer.html,COVID propaganda roundup: Kansas AG sues Pfizer for rigging clinical trials,"Republican governors pledge to resist WHO pandemic treaty (Article republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Non-binding pledges for what look like PR purposes don’t mean much coming from politicians, but let’s not look a gift-horse in the mouth. Via Children’s Health Defense (emphasis added): “ Twenty-six U.S. governors — over half of the nation’s state leaders — have stated publicly that they will not comply with a World Health Organization (WHO)-led global attempt at controlling U.S. Americans’ health . In their Aug. 29 statement, the 26 governors — all Republicans — and the Republican Governors Association accused the WHO of “attempting one world control over health policy” by promoting a “pandemic agreement” or “pandemic treaty .” “Put simply,” they wrote, “Republican Governors will not comply.”” Republican leaders have been busy over the last few years attempting revisionist history regarding what they did or did not do during COVID to resist the lockdowns/mask mandates/vaxx mandates pushed from on high. I’m not a huge fan of Kristi Noem — and she’s probably not going too far in national politics after bragging in her memoir about executing the family puppy named Cricket in a gravel pit like some kind of war atrocity — but she’s absolutely right that there’s a lot of credit-taking for principled leadership in the GOP where credit’s not necessarily deserved. Hers was one of the few states that never locked down even for a moment. Related : People With Plastic Faces Are Not to Be Trusted Via Business Insider , July 2021 (emphasis added): “In a Sunday speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas, Gov. Kristi Noem accused GOP governors of ""rewriting history"" after having instituted COVID-19 restrictions like lockdowns and mask mandates . ""We've got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn't shut down their states; that they didn't close their beaches; that they didn't mandate masks, that they didn't issue shelter-in-place orders,"" Noem said. ""Now I'm not picking fights with Republican governors. All I'm saying is that we need leaders with grit . That their first instinct is to make the right decision. That they don't backtrack and then try to fool you into thinking they never made the wrong decision.""” Pfizer sues Kansas over COVID vaxx lies Given that the pharmaceutical corporations that manufactured the shots were gifted blanket immunity by the government, the only real recourse against them at the moment — aside from the lofty pipe dream of Nuremberg II and public executions — is on false advertising grounds and manipulating trial data. The emergency use authorizations and legal immunity are null if they were obtained through fraud, which is what hopefully can be proven in a court of law in Kansas.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-covid-19-vaccines-damage-the-blood.html,COVID-19 vaccines damage the blood and spread further destruction through blood transfusions,"A recent pre-print study by a team of Japanese researchers has ignited a heated debate within the medical community, revealing serious risks associated with blood transfusions taken from individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccinations. The study highlights six key areas where COVID jabs destroy the continuity and biochemistry of human blood. The study has called into question the safety of using such blood in medical procedures. According to the researchers, the COVID-19 vaccines — which have failed to stimulate a meaningful immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus — have unintended consequences that affect blood integrity. The team’s findings suggest that the vaccines can induce harmful changes in blood, which could pose risks not only to recipients of blood transfusions but also to those receiving organ transplants from vaccinated donors . Six ways COVID vaccines cause blood damage: The study indicates that spike proteins, which the vaccines are designed to produce, can persist in the blood, and accumulate in various organs. These proteins have been linked to several toxic effects , including damage to red blood cells and platelet aggregation. The researchers recommend that blood products be purified to remove these harmful spike proteins. In some cases, the human immune system does not neutralize the spike proteins that are generated by the COVID-19 vaccines. Spike proteins that are not cleared by the body may lead to the formation of amyloid aggregates and microthrombi, or clusters of abnormal proteins and small blood clots. These aggregates are difficult to eliminate and can cause further health issues. Ensuring the removal of these aggregates from contaminated blood is crucial for patient safety. Repeated vaccinations may impair immune function, resulting in insufficient levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies). Blood donated from heavily-vaccinated individuals may provide inadequate levels of immunity to common infections due to immune imprinting or class switch to IgG4. This could potentially make blood from heavily-vaccinated individuals less effective in fighting infections, cancer , and may pose risks to those with weakened immune systems. The mRNA vaccines use lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver genetic material. The study suggests that LNPs and pseudouridinated mRNA may remain in the bloodstream longer than anticipated, which could lead to inflammatory reactions and unintended spike protein synthesis in various body tissues. The presence of aggregated red blood cells or platelets, another side effect of spike proteins, could increase the risk of blood clots and cardiovascular events if not properly addressed before transfusion. Long-term exposure to the vaccine’s spike protein might result in the generation of IgG4 antibodies and memory B cells, which could lead to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction. Unvaccinated blood is medically more valuable and should be the only blood used in transfusions The researchers have called for an immediate review and overhaul of current practices regarding blood donations from vaccinated individuals. Their study highlights the urgent need for specific tests and regulations to address these serious risks. “The health injuries caused by genetic vaccination are already extremely serious, and it is high time that countries and relevant organizations take concrete steps together to identify the risks and to control and resolve them,” the researchers wrote in their paper. This research highlights a critical area of concern in the aftermath of the global vaccination experiment against COVID-19. As medical professionals and regulators realize what they have done to the future blood supply, the priority will be to ensure that blood and organ transplant practices are adapted to minimize potential risks and protect vulnerable patients. Unvaccinated blood should be regarded as pure, and be deemed medically more valuable than vaccinated blood. In fact, according to this study , unvaccinated blood should be the only blood used in blood transfusions. Sources include: Expose-News.com NaturalNews.com NaturalNews.com Preprints.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-sermon-001-wearing-molecular-armor-of-god.html,Nutrition Bible sermon: Mike Adams talks about the importance of putting on the molecular ARMOR OF GOD,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams discussed why it is important to put on the molecular Armor of God during the inaugural sermon of his 100 Sermons series on the ""Health Ranger Report."" The Bible nutrition educator based his first sermon on the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians in the New Testament, specifically where it touches on the Armor of God (Ephesians 6:11). He called on people to don this armor and be strong in the Lord. ""You must express courage and understand that you are acting in the power of his might, that He is with you. God is with us. And with God at your side, we put on the armor of God so that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,"" Adams said. ""We avoid exposure to more toxins such as the vaccine jabs, pesticides, herbicides [and] toxic pharmaceuticals. We pursue clean food, clean supplements, superfoods that contain the miraculous molecules provided by God. Molecules of cleansing and of healing, molecules of protection."" (Related: Mike Adams announces 100 sermons in 100 days… with sermon #1 available now – the MOLECULAR Armor of God. ) The Health Ranger mentioned how certain molecules are found in certain foods, which means that eating them protects the body from within. Letting these molecules circulate through the body allows the molecular Armor of God to do its work. One such molecule is sulforaphane, which can be found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli sprouts. It protects the nerves from toxins and stressors. Another molecule is astaxanthin, a very rich red pigment that purifies the blood when ingested. This molecule also protects the cardiovascular, nervous and musculoskeletal systems. The Bible nutrition educator ultimately noted that whether it is sulforaphane or astaxanthin, these molecules are the Armor of God coursing through a person's veins. Evil forces used FEAR as a weapon against people The founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com said his sermon is about courage, the Armor of God and understanding the war being waged against humanity and God. According to Adams, ""fear"" was the weapon used by the evil forces during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to lock down businesses, churches, schools and people. These dark forces are led by Satan and his minions – the globalists. ""The fear was constant. The fear was the weapon. The fear was more dangerous than the virus,"" he said. ""The plandemic wasn't real, but the fear was something that people would make real in their own minds as they allowed themselves to take in the fear because they were not wearing the Armor of God, and they did not have faith in the Armor of God."" Adams reiterated that people must be able to withstand the time of great evil. He expressed optimism by pointing out that people are fighting against this spiritual wickedness. However, many mainstream churches have become vehicles to discourage people from wearing the molecular Armor of God. Ultimately, a person has to make a conscious decision to step forward and choose a path of courage – paying no heed to things that discourage them from doing so. Adams stressed that if people put on the armor, they can stand against this evil. Follow Awakening.news for more stories about Christian beliefs and principles.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-mulberry-nutrition-insights-health-benefits.html,The power of mulberry: Essential nutrition insights and health benefits you need to know,"Mulberries might not be the most talked-about fruit, but they certainly deserve the spotlight for their impressive nutritional profile . With a taste reminiscent of grapes and a texture similar to blackberries, these berries – known as ""shahtoot” in Hindi, ""mora"" in Spanish and ""mulbar"" in Swedish – pack a powerful punch of nutrients and health benefits . Low in calories (just 43 per 100 grams), mulberries are a rich source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. They contain anthocyanins, which are linked to reduced risks of aging, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, and neurological diseases. Another key antioxidant in mulberries, resveratrol, supports cardiovascular health by improving blood vessel function and lowering blood pressure. Mulberries are also packed with vitamin C – providing about 61 percent of your daily requirement. This vitamin is crucial for boosting the immune system, reducing inflammation and combating oxidative stress. Additionally, these berries offer vitamins A and E, as well as antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, which help protect against eye damage from UV rays. What sets mulberries apart is their iron content – about 23 percent of the recommended daily requirement – important for healthy blood and oxygen transport. They also provide essential minerals, such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sodium and zinc. With a good mix of B vitamins and vitamin K, mulberries play a role in metabolism and overall wellness. In summary, mulberries are a nutritional powerhouse that can enhance your diet with their health-promoting properties. Their combination of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals makes them a superfood worth including in your daily diet. Science-backed health benefits of mulberries Mulberries are not just delicious – they are also packed with health benefits that science backs up. Here’s a look at how these nutrient-rich berries can boost your overall well-being: Bone health Mulberries are rich in vitamin K, calcium and iron – all crucial for building and maintaining strong bones. Regular consumption can help counteract bone degradation and reduce the risk of bone-related disorders, like arthritis and osteoporosis. Blood sugar control White mulberries are especially beneficial for managing blood sugar levels. Research published in PLoS One indicates that mulberry leaf extract can significantly reduce blood glucose and insulin levels after eating carbohydrates – showing promise for those with Type 2 diabetes. Brain health Studies suggest that mulberries are great for keeping your brain sharp and youthful. Research published in Molecular Neurodegeneration indicates that mulberries support brain health by providing essential nutrients , while another study in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience highlights their potential to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease . Digestive health Packed with dietary fiber, mulberries aid digestion by adding bulk to your stool and helping food move smoothly through your digestive tract. This can alleviate common issues, like bloating, constipation and stomach cramps. Research from Italy’s F. de Ritis Institute, published in the Journal of Biological Regulators and Homeostatic Agents , also found that including mulberries in your diet could help with reasonable weight loss – showing a reduction in body weight and waist size over time. Heart health Mulberries contribute to heart health with their fiber, antioxidants and flavonoids. These components help maintain healthy blood flow and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The antioxidant resveratrol , in particular, acts as a natural antibiotic – helping to manage blood pressure and support overall cardiovascular health. Cardiovascular health Mulberries improve blood circulation, control blood pressure and enhance blood vessel function. They are also rich in iron, which promotes the production of red blood cells. Polyphenols in mulberries keep blood vessels healthy, while potassium helps to lower blood pressure. Additionally, mulberries can help reduce bad cholesterol levels – further protecting against cardiovascular issues. Thanks to their iron content, mulberries are excellent in addressing anemia. They help alleviate symptoms, like dizziness and fatigue – making them a great addition for improving overall blood health. Eye health and vision Mulberries are more than just a tasty treat; they are also great for your eyes. Research published in Current Eye Research highlights that mulberries contain cyanidin-3-O-glucoside – an anthocyanin that can enhance vision and protect against retinal damage caused by free radicals. Additionally, mulberries are rich in carotenoids and zeaxanthin, which help reduce oxidative stress in the eyes and may prevent cataracts and macular degeneration. Hair health For vibrant, strong hair, mulberries have got you covered. The antioxidants in these berries support healthy hair growth and reduce breakage. They also help retain natural hair color; when combined with traditional Chinese herbs, mulberries may delay premature graying – thanks to their rich content of calcium, iron and vitamins B and C. Immune defense Mulberries activate macrophages (key cells in the immune system) through alkaloids – helping keep your defenses strong. Additionally, the vitamin C in mulberries further enhances immune function. Mulberries are also rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients that may help reduce cancer risk by inhibiting tumor growth and protecting against inflammation, as shown in studies published in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies and Cancer Letters . The resveratrol in mulberries has also been linked to anti-cancer properties – aiding in the fight against cancers, such as colon, prostate, skin and thyroid, according to research published in Molecules . The white mulberry, in particular, has been used in traditional remedies for colds and flu. A study published in Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine supports their use as an astringent and bactericide to prevent and treat colds and flu – bolstered by vitamin C and flavonoid content. Liver health Mulberries act as a blood tonic – nourishing and purifying the blood in the liver. Rich in iron, mulberries support liver function and overall well-being. Skin health Mulberries are a powerhouse for maintaining radiant, youthful skin. Rich in resveratrol, they protect against harmful UV rays and combat signs of aging. The antioxidants in mulberries, including beta-carotene, neutralize free radicals that contribute to fine lines and wrinkles – keeping your skin smooth and vibrant. Additionally, vitamins A, C and E found in mulberries are essential for preventing and reducing wrinkles – giving your skin a healthy glow. Mulberries also help clear blemishes and dark spots. Their antioxidants regulate melanin production, which can naturally diminish dark spots and even out your skin tone. They also work to unclog pores, remove toxins and moisturize – ensuring your skin remains fresh and vibrant. For those with dry or sensitive skin, mulberries are a great remedy. Packed with vitamins A and E, they help hydrate and soothe dry, irritated skin. Mulberry root extracts are known for their calming effects on sensitive skin – providing much-needed relief. Finally, incorporating mulberries into your diet can result in softer, more radiant skin. Their rich mineral content supports skin elasticity and nourishment – making your skin look and feel rejuvenated. With all these health benefits, you might be tempted to add mulberries to your shopping list now. Visit Fruits.news for more articles about the health benefits of berries and other superfruits.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-fda-still-using-emergency-authorization-release-covid-shots.html,FDA is still using emergency use authorization to release COVID-19 shots without meeting safety standards,"When the FDA announced that new COVID-19 vaccines addressing more recent variants of the virus were available last month, they left out one very important detail: like their predecessors, they were never officially established as being safe or even effective. How did they get away with it this time around? Much like the first COVID-19 vaccines, they took advantage of the “emergency use authorization” power that enables them to use a lower level of evidence than the traditional threshold for proving effectiveness in FDA product approvals. It essentially means that proving that they “may be effective” is justification enough to flood the market with these untested jabs. Although the reasoning for granting emergency use authorization might have made some sense when we were in the early days of the pandemic, a lot of people are wondering why this authority is still intact four years after the fact. After all, even the CDC and the World Health Organization have conceded that the virus is no longer a public health emergency -- more than a year ago. The latest statistics on the virus from health authorities back up the assertion that the virus is nowhere near the threat it once may have been. At the end of August, just 2.3% of visits to emergency rooms in the U.S. stemmed from COVID-19, while the hospitalization rate is on a downward trend and currently stands at just 0.005%. The death rate, meanwhile, has dropped from the 26,028 weekly deaths recorded at its peak in 2021 to just 663 – and that number refers to deaths “involving” COVID-19 but not necessarily caused by it. In an article published by The Federalist , Kentucky Senator Dr. Rand Paul asked why the FDA is so reluctant to call off the emergency designation. “Until the FDA stops approving new Covid vaccines under the EUA, and analyzes and reports the safety and efficacy of Covid mRNA vaccines based on established standards, there will remain a cloud of uncertainty about taking these medicines,” he wrote. FDA is encouraging all Americans to get the latest shots despite declining hospitalizations and deaths In August, it was announced that Pfizer and Moderna would be shipping millions of doses of the updated vaccines , with Novavax releasing a modified version of its own vaccine shortly thereafter. The CDC wasted no time in recommending the shot for all Americans aged six months or older, despite the numerous health risks being linked to previous iterations of the vaccines. The new fall vaccines target Omicron descendants, a subtype known as KP.2, even though the KP.3.1.1 variant is spreading at the moment, accounting for 37% of cases in mid-August. Pfizer maintains that its data shows the current batch provides better protection against multiple subtypes of the virus – but we should take that with a grain of salt considering how deceptive their data has turned out to be in the past. As part of the vaccine push, it is being noted that the versions released last fall target a different strain that is no longer in circulation. Moreover, uptake was low, with just over 22% of adults and 14% of children rolling up their sleeves last year. By now, many people already enjoy immunity from previous infections, and the virus itself has evolved to become more transmissible but less dangerous. When the latest vaccines were announced, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, claimed in a statement: “These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.” He conveniently forgot to mention that the standards remain way lower than usual thanks to their ongoing manipulation of emergency use authorization powers .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-covid-jab-spike-proteins-catapult-cancer-neurological-disorders.html,"BOMBSHELL LAB FINDINGS: Covid jab spike proteins likely accelerate cancer, neurological disorders, dementia, Crohn’s, Lyme and more","Back in February, U.S. Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin held a roundtable discussion titled ‘ Federal Health Agencies and the COVID Cartel: What Are They Hiding? ’. In attendance at that forum was an internal medicine specialist and medical doctor named Sabine Hazan , who conducts and supervises clinical trials for cutting-edge medical research, including that based on gastroenterology. Dr. Hazan investigates Big Pharma companies for corruption, a very daring and courageous effort to help the world realize how much fraud and insidious planning Western Medicine engages in, especially the Vaccine Industrial Complex. Dr. Sabine Hazan discovered that Covid-19 mRNA gene therapy injections kill 90% of good gut flora called bifidobacteria, catapulting most major diseases and disorders The key component that makes up 90% of our biological seat of immunity for fighting diseases is KILLED OFF by spike proteins from mRNA jabs that travel to the gut. Anyone who got Covid vaccinated could be catapulting cancer, IBS, autism, dementia and catching Covid or the next pandemic of Bird Flu, Monkeypox, or whatever other gain-of-function lab-made virus Big Pharma releases into the wild. Gastroenterologist Dr. Sabine Hazan tested the microbiomes of doctors who volunteered to be tested BEFORE and AFTER getting Covid vaccinated with spike protein prion creating mRNA jabs and discovered that their most important gut bacteria were wiped out within 30 days to almost non-existent. What’s worse is that bifidobacteria remained decimated for 60 days, 90 days, even up to six months. She then tested newborn babies, whose mothers were injected before their birth with Covid jabs, and the babies had ZERO bifidobacteria (good gut flora) microbes after 90 days and they stayed at zero nine months later. Let that sink in. These newborns have next-to-zero immunity during their first year of life due to the Covid vaccine. Dr. Hazan had applied for grants and loans to do this research, but of course, no way was Big Pharma, the FDA or the CDC going to help her do this kind of research that exposes the vaccine industry and Covid jabs for what they really are – biological weapons of mass destruction and genocide. We’re not just talking about autism caused by Covid jabs, but cancer, dementia, neurological disorders, severe allergic reaction and heart complications The problem is compounded for people who contracted Covid, which means the virus and the mRNA jabs both destroy vital and beneficial gut bacteria. Dr. Hazan said, “I kept collecting stool samples of patients and noticed that patients with severe covid had a certain bacteria that was missing compared to people that were highly exposed to covid, but never got covid. That bacteria is called bifidobacteria. Bifidobacteria is an important and key microbe for immunity. It represents your trillion-dollar industry of probiotics.” Dr. Hazan also explained the mystery of why babies and young children were not catching Covid, and if they did, they were not at risk of getting a severe case of it or dying. She said that bifidobacteria is present in newborns, but it’s absent in elderly people as just part of the process of ageing. See where this is heading? Covid and the jabs are part of the population reduction agenda of the globalists who funded gain-of-function and instructed scientists to create “vaccines” that did further damage to the biological seat of immunity for all humans infected and/or injected. It took Dr. Hazan eight months to publish this research paper entitled ‘ The lost microbes of Covid-19 ’. She also wrote about how vitamin C increases bifidobacteria. In conclusion, the loss of bifidobacteria is a catapult for humans contracting, developing and suffering from a whole host of diseases and disorders, most of which would be prevented by simply boosting good gut bacteria with probiotics, eating clean healthy food, and avoiding the deadly Covid jabs at all costs.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-putin-sees-massive-weaknesses-of-western-culture.html,Putin sees weakness in Western culture – and most Americans don’t realize it because they’re chronically sick and brain-numbed,"The President of Russia passed a law in his country that any Russians caught growing or selling bioengineered foods in Russia, in other words, anything with genetically modified organisms (GMOs), shall be considered a terrorist . On top of this, Putin subsidizes and funds land for farmers who will grow crops organically. There is no glorifying a leader of a communist country, but it is worth considering how he views Western culture and consider this as a way of seeing the forest for the trees, as the saying goes. Putin says most of the United States populace is over-vaccinated , over-medicated , overfed, and stuck sitting watching the dummy box (TV), believing in our fake news every night about proxy wars and our own lying politicians, while eating food that has no nutrients. Health dangers of consuming GMOs are highly underrated in America, so Putin is correct In June of 2016, Vladimir Putin signed a law banning all production and selling of GMOs in the territory of the entire Russian Federation, excluding examinations and scientific research. This was approved by the Federation Council and Parliament there in that same month. That law bans any imports of GMOs aimed for releasing to the environment also. Why did he do this? Genetically modified foods are lab-concocted to contain toxic ingredients that kill insects, weeds, and animals that eat and destroy crops. These toxins are woven into the genetic makeup of the plants and seeds for the most popular crops, like soy and corn. GMOs are not tested for long-term health consequences in humans, and are believed to destroy good gut bacteria, leading to diseases and disorders like cancer and dementia. Also, GMO crops are often sprayed with even more pesticides, including glyphosate, that can destroy vital cleansing organs like the kidneys, liver and pancreas, plus drive cancer rates sky high. Most Americans shop foods mainly for price and convenience, subjecting themselves to consuming pesticide-laden GMO ingredients in every meal, snack, and even beverages. Almost every popular corporate food brand is chock full of GMOs. This can damage cognition and critical thinking also, which is probably another reason Putin doesn’t want his people consuming them. He obviously understands and values the high-nutritional value of organic food. In the long-run, Americans are spending more money on conventional food than just the conventional GMO-laden, highly processed and “sale-priced” food stuff. Got a coupon? It’s probably for junk-science food. Save $20 on that GMO shopping spree, then spend thousands of dollars yearly on deductibles and copays for medications, doctor visits, hospital visits plus over-the-counter meds for colds, flus, headaches, digestive issues and so forth. The Fake News Industrial Complex of America wants us all to HATE Putin and everything Russian, and blame them for all of our problems, including wars we instigate and fund, elections the Democrats cheat in, and “misinformation” that’s really a way for the Communist-Democrats in DC censoring Conservatives , Republicans and Independents from spreading the truth about it all.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-time-kamala-supports-gender-transition-surgeries-illegals.html,Time magazine issues correction admitting Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for illegals,"Time magazine was forced to release a correction on Sept. 11, admitting that Vice President Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for illegal immigrants. Former President Donald Trump said during the presidential debate moderated by ABC News on Sept. 10 that Harris ""wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison."" Even CNN discovered and reported recently that in 2019, Harris answered an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questionnaire while she was running for the Democratic Party's nomination that she would support ""taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained migrants."" ""It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition ,"" Harris wrote at the time. ""That's why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates."" Harris added that she supports policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees can receive medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. ""Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,"" Harris stated. During its coverage of the debate, Time claimed Trump ""falsely claimed that Harris wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison."" After the truth of the matter came out, Time was forced to issue a correction. (Related: Kamala Harris loves transgender child mutilation and other degenerate LGBT perversion .) ""The original version of this story mischaracterized as false Donald Trump's statement accusing Kamala Harris of supporting ' transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison .' As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris filled out a questionnaire saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender transition treatment for detained immigrants,"" the Time correction read. While it's true that Time earns some credit for releasing a correction, most critics assert that it should have never published a lie about Trump . ""Same old story. Lie, gaslight, then correct it quietly and secretly. How many times do Americans have to see the same playbook to know the game by now?"" one critic tweeted. ""This right here is exactly why people do not trust the mainstream media,"" added another critic. Other present and former media propagandists accusing Trump of telling lies Time was not alone in accusing Trump of lying during the debate regarding Harris' support for providing free transition surgeries for migrants. Prominent media personalities have also chimed in, including former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill, New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser, The Atlantic staff writer Jennifer Senior and The Insider editor Michael Weiss. ""'She wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens who are in prison' is the WILDEST thing I've ever heard in any debate. EVER,"" Hill wrote. Glasser wrote, ""Trump made history last night for sure. Who will ever forget him ranting on stage about immigrants eating people's dogs? Or insisting that the Vice President 'wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in jail'?"" Senior jested, ""'Transgender operations on illegal aliens' is really unfair to those Americans playing drinking games."" ""'Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens who are in prison.' That's verbatim,"" Weiss stated. The Daily Beast also listed Trump's quote as one of the ""best memes"" of the night without citing Harris' past support for gender transition operations. CNN brought Harris' position back into the limelight on Sept. 9 after senior editor Andrew Kaczynski reported to host Erin Burnett about the recently revealed 2019 ACLU candidate questionnaire featuring the former California senator's policy stance.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-trump-obamacare-stays-until-better-alternative-found.html,Trump: Obamacare to stay until better alternative is found,"Former President Donald Trump's campaign has remarked that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, will remain in place under his term until a better alternative to the scheme is found . Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, claimed in a Sept. 7 post on X: ""Trump intends to end the ACA, which would take us back to a time where insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going back."" The Trump campaign shot back, telling the second-highest official in the land: ""Kamala, quit lying."" It also included a clip of Trump sharing his plans for Obamacare with supporters. ""I am going to keep the ACA unless we can do something much better. We'll keep it, but we can do much better. It's too expensive for the people, they can't afford it, it's lousy health care. If we can do something better, we're working on it; we can do something better,"" the real estate mogul said in the video. ""But we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better. We're going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients."" According to LifeSiteNews , Trump's rewritten Republican Party platform – which he cites as his campaign platform on his campaign website – is light on details in most policy areas. But the passage on the subject of healthcare begins by acknowledging that ""healthcare and prescription drug costs are out of control."" ""Republicans will increase transparency, promote choice and competition and expand access to new affordable healthcare and prescription drug options. We will protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs."" The pro-life news outlet pointed out that promoting choice as outlined in the GOP platform ""is inconsistent with some of Obamacare's core features – an individual mandate to own health insurance and mandates for what health insurance must cover."" Trump not a fan of Obamacare LifeSiteNews further highlighted Trump's latest shift from his previous campaigns. The GOP nominee said at a campaign rally last December: ""We're going to fight to give much better healthcare than what you have right now. This is a newer subject, but Obamacare is a disaster. And I said … we're going to do something about it."" The former president also mentioned how U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) remarked that the ACA ""needs to be fixed."" ""Trump campaigned in 2016 on repealing Obamacare, but despite taking office backed by a GOP Congress, [they] failed to do so due to a variety of factors,"" LifeSiteNews continued. ""As his presidency went on, Trump used executive actions to mitigate some of Obamacare's most objectionable aspects."" (Related: Biden attacks Trump on abortion, healthcare. ) During the Sept. 10 debate between Trump and Harris, which ABC News organized, Trump expressed interest in replacing the ACA. However, he admitted that he doesn't currently have an organized plan to accomplish this if the law is indeed repealed. ""I have concepts of a plan. I'm not president right now,"" said Trump.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-wipo-plays-language-police-no-man-allowed.html,UN agency plays language police with new rules against gendered language,"An agency under the United Nations has assumed the role of language police by issuing guidance against ""gendered language"" – zooming in on the word ""man."" According to InfoWars , the Switzerland-based World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) ""is cracking down on the use of so-called masculine terminology in its communications and documentation."" Instead of ""masculine terms,"" the WIPO, which is in charge of trademarks and patents worldwide, is suggesting politically correct gender-neutral terms. Under the WIPO's guidance, words such as ""lumberjack"" and ""cavemen"" will no longer be used. The proposed replacements are ""wood chopper"" and ""cave dwellers."" Even the phrase ""brotherhood of man"" is set to be replaced by ""humankind."" The Daily Mail also gave other examples in a separate report. The WIPO suggests that the term ""man's best friend"" be replaced by ""a faithful dog."" The term ""man on the street"" ought to be replaced with either ""ordinary citizen"" or ""typical person,"" while the adjective ""sportsmanlike"" should be avoided in favor of ""fair."" Moreover, WIPO staffers are urged to ditch the term ""Englishman"" and instead use ""English person"" or ""English national."" The term ""midwife"" isn't spared, as the agency's guidance recommends the alternative ""birth attendant."" Despite this, the guidance ultimately acknowledged that midwife ""may still be the preferable term, depending on the context."" (Related: CDC goes ""woke,"" says Americans need to use more “inclusive” language when talking about health .) According to the Mail , the guidance signed off by WIPO Director-General Daren Tang is ""not prescriptive and common sense and clarity of text should always prevail."" Moreover, it was ""designed to be a straightforward awareness-raising exercise for our colleagues on how to use language that resonates with the widest possible audience, which may include avoiding terms that are linked to one specific gender when other neutral, more-inclusive words are available."" WIPO guidance described as ORWELLIAN The WIPO's guidance argued that ""masculine-specific"" terms risk giving the impression that ""women are not represented in certain groups or do not possess certain skills."" But critics have decried the guidance as an Orwellian attempt to police language . Toby Young, founder and general secretary of the London-based Free Speech Union, warned: ""This is precisely what George Orwell warned us about. Banning certain words and phrases to advance a dogmatic political ideology is a hallmark of totalitarianism."" Graham Barnfield, assistant news editor at the European Conservative , also put in his two cents. He described the politically correct suggestions as ""a series of stretched neologisms, with all the charm of something thrown together by committee – if not by a veterinarian trying to reassemble animals amid a butcher’s shop window display."" He also noted that despite widespread mockery, the WIPO's process of ""eliminating 'problematic' words also has a sinister side."" According to Barnfield, ""when WIPO suggests its staff use 'birth attendant' as an alternative to 'midwife,' it's as if it intends to erase the history of a mostly female occupation that had to fight the restrictions of a male-dominated medical profession. ""Yet when applied, they will work against both clarity and common sense. There’s very little in reality – or 'lived experience' in the jargon – to encourage people outside of WIPO to adopt its language, even businesses working with patents and trademarks. Faced with public bemusement, the logical next step is for the agency to take a more aggressive approach to enforcing the guidelines. ""It would be better if the English language was left to change by itself, evolving organically through use and custom, as it has done throughout its history. The WIPO needs to stop imposing its rules and recognize instead that 'an Englishman's home is his castle,' or to use the new UN-friendly jargon, 'an English national's home is their castle.'""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-study-reveals-link-between-cataracts-vascular-dementia.html,New study reveals link between cataracts and vascular dementia,"A new study has found that cataracts can increase a person's risk of dementia , particularly vascular dementia. Also known as vascular cognitive impairment, vascular dementia is characterized by impaired thinking skills caused by obstructions in the blood flow to various regions of the brain. This reduced blood flow deprives brain cells of much-needed oxygen and nutrients, which eventually leads to their death. Link between visual impairment and poor cognitive function Many ongoing studies are exploring the relationship between poor vision and cognitive decline. Scientific interest in the topic was sparked by The Lancet Commission 2020 report on dementia prevention which identified hearing impairment, specifically hearing loss, as a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Since then, researchers have begun exploring the possibility of visual impairment also increasing the risk of cognitive impairment. In a study published in the journal Human Brain Mapping , researchers looked at how visual impairment and retinal neurodegeneration are connected to cognitive impairment. They found that decreased visual acuity and the thinning of the ganglion cell layer were associated with global brain atrophy (decrease in size) and hippocampal atrophy . The ganglion cell layer is a layer in the retina that contains the neurons responsible for transmitting information to at least 50 different areas of the midbrain. According to the study, neurodegeneration along the visual pathway, which leads to the disintegration of intermediate visual tracts, is behind the association between visual impairment and cognitive impairment. Although the entire process is still unclear, researchers believe that changes in the visual pathway caused by retinal neurodegeneration negatively affect cognitive function by altering the structure of brain regions that are crucial to cognition. A similar study published in the journal Aging & Mental Health investigated whether cataracts, one of the most common causes of visual impairment in older adults, is associated with the risk of developing dementia or cognitive impairment. Meta-analysis of 11 studies involving a total of 489,211 participants revealed a significant association between cataracts and an increased risk of all-cause dementia . Subgroup analyses also showed that individuals who develop cataracts have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Another study, this time by Chinese researchers, explored the relationship between cataracts and the incidence of cognitive impairment in older adults. Published in the journal Behavioral Brain Research , the meta-analysis looked at 13 studies that involved a total of 798,694 participants. The Chinese researchers found that compared to those without cataracts, participants that developed cataracts had a higher risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia, vascular dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, an earlier study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine reported that undergoing cataract surgery could reduce the risk of dementia by 30 percent . This lowered risk, specifically of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia, persisted for over a decade after surgery, further cementing the link between cataracts and visual impairment and cognitive impairment. However, much like the mechanisms underlying the link between visual impairment and cognitive decline, how cataract surgery lowers dementia risk remains unclear. Researchers, on the other hand, hypothesize that it may have to do with people receiving higher quality visual input and getting more blue light, which is specifically blocked by cataracts, after undergoing surgery. (Related: Extract from moringa trees found to prevent cataract formation .) Eye-brain connection: cataracts and vascular dementia Cataracts are common among older adults. In fact, according to the National Eye Institute , more than half of American adults age 80 and above either have cataracts or have had surgery to remove them. Cataract refers to a cloudy area in the lens of the eye that obstructs vision, often caused by normal changes in your eyes as you age. Eye injury or damage from eye surgery, excessive sun exposure and health problems like diabetes can also raise your risk of developing cataracts. In a new study published in the journal JAMA Network Open , American researchers sought to understand how vision and eye conditions are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Specifically, they wished to clarify whether this association is causal and if vision is also a modifiable risk factor for dementia. (Related: Anti-inflammatory diet helps with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cuts dementia risk by 31% .) Using data from the UK Biobank and genome-wide association studies on cataract, myopia (nearsightedness) and Alzheimer's, the researchers conducted an observational study to establish associations, followed by a 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) study which involved genetic analysis to determine causal relationships. The analyzed data came from individuals aged 55 to 70 years who were dementia-free when they began to participate in the UK Biobank study. Of the 304,?953 selected participants, 14,295 had cataracts and 2,754 had worse than 20/40 vision. The researchers found that having cataracts and myopia was associated with a higher risk of ADRDs . MR analyses further revealed that cataracts were associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia as well as lower total gray matter volume and white matter hyperintensities, which are believed to be predictive of stroke, dementia and death . MR analyses also estimated that cataracts are ""associated with a 92 percent increase in the odds of vascular dementia risk."" On the other hand, while poor visual acuity was linked to increased dementia risk, myopia was not associated with dementia in the MR analyses. The researchers also conducted genetic analysis to determine potential reverse causality. They found that Alzheimer's disease is not associated with cataract formation. Based on their findings, the researchers concluded that ""cataracts increase the risk of dementia through vascular and non-AD [Alzheimer's disease] mechanisms,"" meaning cataracts contribute to the development of Alzheimer's through pathways not commonly linked to the disease. Because cataracts were also associated with reduced total brain and gray matter volumes, the researchers suspect that these pathways may have something to do with brain shrinkage or damage to the brain's small blood vessels. These suspicions are bolstered by the appearance of bright spots on the MRI scans of participants with cataracts, which suggests white matter lesions – clear markers of small vessel disease . While the researchers were unable to explain how cataracts raise the risk of vascular dementia, their findings nevertheless support the hypothesis that treating or preventing cataracts could reduce a person's dementia risk . (Related: Prevent age-related cataracts by increasing your intake of vitamins and carotenoids .) Prevent cataracts naturally As with many health issues, adopting healthy lifestyle changes is the best strategy you can employ to reduce your risk of developing cataracts. Here are some tips for preventing cataract formation later in life: (h/to to VeryWellHealth.com ) Quit smoking - Studies have linked smoking to a higher risk of developing cataracts later in life, while quitting has been shown to reduce cataract risk by up to 21 percent . Reduce your alcohol consumption - According to a study, excessive alcohol consumption significantly increases your risk of age-related cataract , but moderate consumption (two drinks or less for men and one drink or less for women) may offer protective benefits. Limit your sun exposure - Years of chronic sun exposure has been found to raise the risk of cataracts and other eye conditions. This is because ultraviolet (UV) A and B can damage lens proteins by triggering oxidative stress . Manage existing conditions - Many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and chronic kidney disease, can put you at risk of cataract formation. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, eating a well-balanced diet and exercising regularly can help you lose weight and manage these conditions. Get plenty of antioxidants - Aside from getting all the nutrients you need from a healthy diet, increased intake of antioxidants, particularly lutein and zeaxanthin, can help prevent cataracts . These protective carotenoids are highly concentrated in your retina and help protect your eyes from UV rays. You can get lutein and zeaxanthin from dark green leafy vegetables, some fruits like grapes and kiwi fruit, squash, pumpkins, pistachios and egg yolk. Increase your omega-3 intake - According to a study published in the International Journal of Ophthalmology , having sufficient omega-3 levels can help lower your risk of cataracts . You can get omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseed and chia seeds. (Related: 10 Foods that help to prevent cataracts .) Dementia can be prevented by ensuring good nutrition, living a healthy, active lifestyle and maintaining good eye health. Read more stories about how to keep your brain healthy at Brain.news .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-epa-no-legal-obligation-regulate-pfas-sewage-sludge.html,"EPA claims it has no legal obligation to regulate toxic PFAS in sewage sludge, dismisses pollutant that affects every American","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) essentially just admitted that it does not regulate one of the most toxic classes of chemicals proliferating our farms, yards, parks and water supplies . The regulatory body claimed it is not legally required to regulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the sewage sludge that is applied as fertilizer on U.S. farmland. This position was disclosed in a recent court filing by the EPA addressing a lawsuit brought by the environmental watchdog group, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Lawsuit exposes EPA's willful disregard for PFAS proliferation in the environment The lawsuit, initiated in June 2024 , was filed on behalf of a group of Texas farmers and ranchers who allege that PFAS contamination from sewage sludge has led to severe health issues among their livestock. The farmers believe that the toxic sewage sludge is not only jeopardizing their animals’ health and their livelihoods, but its proliferation has also devalued their property. The EPA's motion to dismiss the case, submitted on September 9, 2024, argues that the agency is not mandated to specifically identify or regulate PFAS chemicals under current legal frameworks. According to the EPA, the Clean Water Act necessitates periodic reviews of sewage sludge regulations, but it does not obligate the agency to identify and regulate additional toxic pollutants, including PFAS. The EPA asserts that it has discretion to regulate such pollutants but this discretion remains within the agency's purview and is not a legally enforceable requirement. “The relief they seek — an order directing EPA to identify PFAS in its next biennial report and to regulate PFAS thereafter — is simply not available,” the EPA stated in its court filing. In other words, EPA officials do not have to follow any consistent code of conduct and refuse to be held accountable when they fail to do their job. PEER attorney Laura Dumais countered that the EPA's position contradicts the Clean Water Act’s mandate and could potentially endanger the health of millions exposed to PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge. ""The agency’s stance ignores the evident risk that PFAS-laden sludge poses when spread over vast agricultural lands,"" Dumais said in a press release. Instead of addressing a systemic environmental and health issue, the agency would rather pretend that the issue is unchangeable, and that the toxin’s elimination is impossible, unenforceable. The Clean Water Act specifies that the EPA review sewage sludge “every two years to identify any additional pollutants that may occur.” Additionally, the EPA is required to set and enforce regulations for those pollutants if sufficient scientific evidence shows they may harm human health or the environment.” With backlash mounting, the EPA is currently undertaking a risk assessment for two specific PFAS chemicals currently present in biosolids. The findings are expected to be published by the end of 2024, potentially influencing future regulatory actions. Cancer-causing PFAS proliferate sewage sludge but their presence has been ignored by regulators for decades PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large class of synthetic chemicals known for their water- and grease-resistant properties. These ""forever chemicals"" are used in a variety of industrial applications and consumer products, including non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics and firefighting foams. Their chemical structure, characterized by a chain of carbon atoms bonded to fluorine atoms, makes them highly stable and resistant to degradation. This stability leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in living organisms, posing significant challenges for environmental and public health. PFAS contamination is particularly concerning due to their association with serious health issues, such as cancers , liver damage and reproductive disorders, as well as their widespread presence in soil, water and food supplies. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture has labeled PFAS as a “major hazard” for U.S. farmers, with contamination incidents reportedly affecting agricultural operations in multiple states. Municipal and industrial waste is typically treated to eliminate pathogens before being used as fertilizer, but PFAS compounds are not removed during this process. As a result, over 2.4 million tons of biosolids , which often contain PFAS, are applied annually to farms, pastures, parks and home gardens across the United States.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-moderna-covid-vaccine-batches-deadlier-pfizer-batches.html,Czech Republic data: Some Moderna COVID-19 vaccine batches are 8x DEADLIER than Pfizer batches,"A Moderna Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine batch can be eight times deadlier than a Pfizer batch given to the same five-year age group at the same time. Meanwhile, some Pfizer batches were three times more lethal than other batches from the same manufacturer. This was according to a batch analysis of the Czech Republic data comparing one-year post-injection all-cause mortality rates. According to Steve Kirsch, founder of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, the one-year mortality rates should be very similar to each other to ensure that the vaccines are safe. But, they are not, he pointed out. And health officials refused to look at the data and never told the public about the quality control problems. Kirsch warned in his Substack article that one batch can't have a three times higher all-cause mortality than the others. ""That's insane. Here are two batches given in the same month to the same five-year age range. You can repeat this for other younger five-year age ranges and you get the same factor of three so this is not a fluke,"" he said. ""I'm only writing this article to create a public record that the data shows the COVID-19 injections are a train wreck and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out,"" Kirsch wrote. ""Nobody should be taking these injections."" He's just comparing the different batches of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines. Moderna's vaccines are worse. Malone: Moderna knows mRNA vaccines contain contaminants Moderna has admitted its mRNA vaccine causes cancer after billions of DNA fragments were found in vials of the dangerous injection. The revelation was made after Dr. Robert Malone recently made an appearance at the ""Injuries Caused by (COVID-19) Vaccines"" hearing led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), where he revealed how Moderna's patent shows that its "" COVID-19 vaccine vials contain billions of DNA fragments and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer."" (Related: Moderna admits in patent filings that its mRNA COVID-19 injections can cause CANCER .) Malone spoke about how Moderna acknowledges in its patent that RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines because of the risks involved. However, the company's mRNA injection is contaminated with DNA fragments. ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines,"" Malone stated. ""And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes because of problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claimed it is not aware of any concerns. However, Moderna laid out in its patent the same concerns that exist about DNA in insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity . ""So, Moderna knows it – DNA is a contaminant. It is left in because of the way they make it … they use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA, and then they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA, and the process they are using is not that good,"" Malone said. Scientists from the United States and Canada got their hands on unopened vials of Moderna's COVID-19 and sampled them. The documentation suggests that certain DNA sequences present in the vials are normally not allowed in anything that is going into humans, ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene,"" Malone explained. ""They include these sequences from Simian Virus 40 which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis."" It turns out that Pfizer's mRNA injection for COVID-19 contains the same contaminants. Documentation was provided by the company to regulators in the U.S., Europe and Canada. These regulators deleted the little notation about SV40 sequences in an apparent attempt to hide it from the public. Visit VaccineDamage.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-17-mulberry-ancient-tree-loaded-with-therapeutic-properties.html,Mulberry: The ancient “tree of life” loaded with health-promoting and therapeutic properties,"The mulberry tree has been admired by bees, birds, cooks, drinkers, heaters, insects, poets, travelers and writers alike. Some consider it to be the oldest plant used by humans. Its reputation extends far beyond being a simple source of fruit – it has been praised as the ""tree of life"" and the ""herb of immortality."" Mulberries offer a unique blend of nutrients , making them a valuable addition to any diet. Fresh mulberries are composed of about 88 percent water and contain only 60 calories per cup (140 grams). In terms of nutritional content, they provide approximately 9.8 percent carbohydrates, 1.7 percent fiber, 1.4 percent protein, and just 0.4 percent fat. When dried, mulberries – much like raisins – become even more concentrated, with around 70 percent carbohydrates, 14 percent fiber, 12 percent protein and 3 percent fat. This makes dried mulberries notably high in protein compared to other berries. In addition to their balanced macronutrients , mulberries are also rich in essential vitamins. They contain notable amounts of vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, E and K1. The mineral content of mulberries is equally impressive, with significant levels of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sodium and zinc. These minerals play a crucial role in maintaining overall health – from supporting bone health to boosting the immune system. Mulberry leaves also pack a nutritional punch. They are a source of powerful antioxidants like flavonoids, flavonols and terpenoid phenols. Additionally, the leaves contain essential polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid, which are vital for maintaining heart health. They also provide essential amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. New amino acids like morusimic acids A to F have also been discovered in mulberry leaves using advanced spectroscopic methods. The phytonutrient composition of mulberries can vary depending on factors, such as species, climate, growing conditions and soil composition . Despite these variables, mulberries consistently offer a robust array of nutrients that support overall health and aid in disease prevention. Nutraceutical abilities and therapeutic potential of mulberries Mulberries are more than just a nutritious fruit. They are also a powerhouse of health-promoting and therapeutic properties that contribute to human health and well-being. Here are some of the ways mulberries can support overall wellness: Anti-aging Mulberry extracts have demonstrated anti-aging effects by reducing oxidative stress , which is a major cause of visible aging. A 2024 study published in the Journal of Functional Foods , showed that dried mulberry fruit extracts improved skin appearance and protected against oxidative stress in both lab and animal studies. Anticancer Mulberry’s potential in cancer prevention and treatment is an area of growing interest. Its fruit, leaves and bark contain bioactive compounds that have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and reduce the risk of cancer development. Key compounds, like alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolics found in mulberries contribute to these effects by targeting the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to grow, spread and survive. Studies have shown that mulberry extracts can suppress the proliferation of various types of cancer cells, including breast, colon, liver and lung cancers. The high antioxidant content in mulberries also plays a role in preventing oxidative damage to cells, which is a major contributor to cancer formation. Mulberries help protect DNA from oxidative stress – reducing mutations that could potentially lead to cancerous growths. Another promising component is resveratrol – a potent antioxidant present in mulberries that has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in both lab and animal studies. Resveratrol is known for its ability to interact with cancer signaling pathways, induce apoptosis (programmed cell death in cancer cells) and inhibit angiogenesis – the process by which tumors develop new blood vessels to sustain their growth. This makes mulberry an exciting natural option for both cancer prevention and complementary cancer treatment. Anti-hyperglycemic (blood sugar control) Mulberry’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels makes it valuable for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition. The leaves of the white mulberry have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to manage diabetes and modern research confirms their effectiveness. The key lies in the functional chemical compounds within the leaves, such as DNJ (1-deoxynojirimycin) and polysaccharides, which have been found to inhibit enzymes that break down carbohydrates into glucose. This slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream – preventing spikes in blood sugar after meals. For individuals managing diabetes, mulberry can help maintain more stable blood sugar levels throughout the day. Anti-hyperlipidemic (cholesterol and weight management) Mulberries may help lower cholesterol and support reasonable weight management goals . One study found that consuming 45 grams of mulberries daily for six weeks significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol in humans aged 30 to 60. Additionally, mulberry leaf extracts rich in DNJ (1-deoxynojirimycin) were found to lower triglyceride levels and activate fat-burning processes in obese mice – suggesting its strength in combating obesity and preventing liver fat accumulation. Mulberry extracts have shown the ability to reduce obesity by promoting fat breakdown and preventing the accumulation of fat in the liver. Additionally, mulberry leaf extract fermented with Cordyceps militaris has been shown to stimulate fat breakdown in fat cells – offering a potential for managing obesity. Anti-inflammatory Mulberries, especially their fruits and leaves, are packed with anti-inflammatory compounds, like anthocyanins, flavonoids and phenolic acids, which work by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the body. In particular, mulberry leaf extract has been shown to reduce the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B – a protein complex that plays a central role in controlling inflammation and preventing the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. In experiments on mice, mulberry extracts reduced inflammation in conditions, like xylene-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema. Mulberries are rich in antioxidants that fight free radicals, which are harmful molecules that can damage cells and contribute to diseases like cancer and heart disease. The high antioxidant content helps protect the body from oxidative stress – promoting health and longevity. Antimicrobial Various parts of the mulberry plant, particularly the leaves and bark, contain compounds that can fight a wide range of harmful microorganisms. These natural defenses make mulberry a candidate for combating infections caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. Mulberry leaves have been shown to possess anti-bacterial properties. Studies have demonstrated that ethanol extracts from the leaves can effectively inhibit the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus – a bacteria commonly responsible for skin infections, such as abscesses, boils and cellulitis. In severe cases, S. aureus can cause dangerous bloodstream infections, bone infections or pneumonia. (Related: The leaves of dyer’s mulberry can protect against staph infections .) Mulberry bark also exhibits activity against other bacteria like Escherichia coli (that can produce toxins harmful to the intestines) and Salmonella typhimurium (a leading cause of Salmonella infections). The anti-bacterial compounds in mulberry, particularly phenolic compounds, like quercetin contribute to these effects. The anti-microbial properties of mulberry extracts are concentration-dependent – meaning their effectiveness increases with higher doses. This flexibility allows mulberry-derived products to be adjusted for different types of infections and varying severity. Anti-schistosomal (fighting parasitic infections) Mulberry extracts have demonstrated promising results in combating parasitic infections, particularly schistosomiasis – a disease caused by the Schistosoma parasite. Schistosomiasis affects millions of people worldwide, especially in developing regions – leading to long-term health complications, such as liver damage, kidney failure and bladder cancer. Anxiolytic (stress relief) Studies have found that mulberries have anxiolytic properties. This means they can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of calm – naturally uplifting mood. Cardioprotective Mulberries may also benefit those suffering from high blood pressure (hypertension) – a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The anti-hypertensive properties are largely due to its ability to improve the function of blood vessels and reduce inflammation – both of which are key factors in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Mulberries may help reduce the buildup of plaque in the arteries – a process known as atherogenesis. This makes mulberries beneficial for heart health by lowering the risk of heart disease. Mulberry extracts contain flavonoids and potassium, which help relax blood vessels and promote better circulation. These compounds also act as natural diuretics – encouraging the body to excrete excess sodium, which helps lower blood pressure. Hormonal support Mulberries can help promote the synthesis of estrogen and progesterone – hormones that play a vital role in reproductive health. Neuroprotective Mulberry extracts have neuroprotective effects – meaning they help protect the brain and nervous system from damage, which could be beneficial in preventing or managing neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. With such a broad spectrum of health-enhancing properties , mulberry truly stands out as a superfood with nutraceutical potential – offering therapeutic solutions for many modern health challenges – from diabetes and heart disease to inflammation and infections.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-doctors-big-pharma-deceptive-dangerous-practices.html,Many doctors are completely in the dark about the extent of Big Pharma’s deceptive and dangerous practices,"Pharmaceutical companies have engaged in so many questionable activities over the years that those of us who have been paying attention often wonder why so many doctors continue to willingly peddle their products. From recalled drugs that they knew were dangerous all along to their untested COVID-19 vaccines that destroyed numerous people’s health, it all feels very much like an open secret that they don’t have people’s best interests at heart. However, those who get their news from the mainstream media are blissfully unaware of all this, and that includes many medical professionals as well. As the pandemic demonstrated, the mainstream media has to keep its advertisers happy, and that includes pharmaceutical companies, and they’re also influenced by the government. As a result, many doctors are surprisingly naïve to what has been going on with Big Pharma and its numerous deceptions and illegal actions. Most doctors enter the field out of a genuine desire to help people. Although there have been cases of doctors knowingly risking their patients’ health in pursuit of profits, many of them want to keep people healthy and truly believe that pharmaceuticals are the answer – often based on what they are taught in medical school. And while there is no doubt that some drugs and other interventions save lives every day, failing to research these solutions and stay on top of independent news reports about pharmaceutical companies means some doctors are unwittingly doing more harm than good. Study shows 85% of pharmaceutical companies engaged in illegal activities For example, not many doctors are aware of a peer-reviewed article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2020 looking at illegal activities by pharmaceutical companies from 2003 to 2016. That study revealed that 85 percent of the companies studied had been hit with financial penalties for their illegal activities, adding up to a total combined value of $33 billion. The illegal activities that these companies engaged in ranged from misleading marketing and failing to disclose negative information about their products such as serious side effects, to manufacturing and distributing adulterated drugs. They also found cases of companies providing kickbacks to medical professionals, pricing violations and bribing foreign officials. There were a lot of familiar names on the list, with GlaxoSmithKline paying overall fines of nearly $10 billion, Pfizer on the hook for $2.9 billion and Johnson & Johnson paying $2.6 billion in penalties. Eli Lilly, Merck, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis were also among the names identified in the study as being fined for illegal activities. In many of these situations, court cases drag out for years, with pharmaceutical companies appealing to higher courts when they are hit with unfavorable findings. This can make it very difficult for patients and other victims to hold them accountable. It's also important to note that although you may hear about some of these convictions if you are willing to seek out the information yourself, there are also numerous settlements that never come to light, with companies paying money to their victims without admitting any guilt. Covering up unfavorable studies and ghostwriting journal articles One of the more blatant examples of pharmaceutical company wrongdoing was seen with Merck's anti-arthritis drug Vioxx, which was used by as many as 80 million people around the world at its peak popularity. Although it was marketed as being a safer alternative to other anti-inflammatory drugs, it was later revealed – after patients suffered from heart attacks – that a study funded by Merck found a sevenfold increase in heart attacks, but they went on to gain approval by the FDA anyway. Another study funded by the company found a fivefold increase in heart attacks, but the company failed to include some of them in the data they submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine , leaning to a “misleading conclusion” about the risk of the drug. There have also been cases involving journals that were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and made to look like independent scientific journals containing articles that were ghostwritten by Merck employees and attributed to doctors. The evidence is out there, and if we assume that what we’re aware of represents only a fraction of their wrongdoings and that they have likely done even more but haven’t been caught, it’s horrifying to think of the damage that could be done. Many doctors who pushed COVID-19 vaccines said that they believed they were safe because they thought that pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t do anything to hurt people, but apparently, they just weren’t paying enough attention.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-singapore-launches-quarantine-and-vaccination-campaign-monkeypox.html,Singapore launches quarantine and vaccination campaign for monkeypox,"In response to the global rise in monkeypox cases, Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Sept. 4 that it will be reintroducing mandatory quarantine and vaccination measures – much like those implemented during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This decision follows the World Health Organization 's (WHO) declaration of monkeypox, or mpox, as a public health emergency of international concern in August. (Related: Here comes the fear: The WHO warns that the new mutant strain of monkeypox is an emergency ""for the entire globe."" ) The MOH has categorized mpox cases as Clade I and Clade II. Clade I is considered the more serious strain – with a higher potential for severe outcomes, while Clade II generally results in milder symptoms. The MOH has made it mandatory for all health care providers in Singapore to report mpox cases. To manage the outbreak, designated hospitals in Singapore will test suspected Clade I cases using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The MOH acknowledged, however, that there are currently no rapid diagnostic tests for mpox that are reliable enough for widespread use. Once a case of Clade I mpox is confirmed, close contacts will be quarantined for 21 days in government-designated facilities. This lengthy quarantine period is reminiscent of Singapore's stringent COVID-19 protocols in 2020 and 2021 that were aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. The ministry emphasized that it is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to respond swiftly if necessary – working in coordination with international health organizations. Singapore mandating monkeypox vaccinations In addition to quarantine measures, Singapore has authorized the use of the Jynneos vaccine to combat mpox. This vaccine will be administered to two specific groups: healthcare workers who are at the highest risk of exposure and individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed mpox cases. The MOH explained that the Jynneos vaccine is a live attenuated (non-replicating) vaccine. It is recommended that close contacts receive a single dose within 14 days of exposure to reduce the risk of developing the disease. Furthermore, close contacts under quarantine will be offered the vaccine during their isolation period, though details on whether individuals will have the option to refuse the vaccine were not provided. The MOH assured the public that it has an adequate supply of the Jynneos vaccine to meet the current needs of its vaccination strategy. It also pledged to adjust its approach as the situation evolves both locally and globally. As of Aug. 22, Singapore has confirmed 13 cases of mpox in 2024 – all of which were of the less severe Clade II strain. The MOH also confirmed that no cases of the more virulent Clade I strain have been detected in the country so far. However the MOH continues to advise caution and urges travelers to remain vigilant – particularly those returning from regions with high mpox activity. While the threat of mpox, particularly the deadlier Clade 1b strain, remains a global concern, health experts in Singapore have reassured the public that quarantine is unnecessary for returning travelers unless they exhibit symptoms or have been in direct contact with infected individuals.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-why-you-should-stock-up-on-honey.html,Prepping essentials: Why you should waste no time stocking up on honey,"Honey is a remarkable gift from nature that has been cherished for centuries. Not only is it nutritious, but honey also lasts indefinitely when stored correctly. Beyond its role as a natural alternative to sugar, honey serves as a valuable tool in medicine and for food preservation. Honey is an essential item for preppers and survivalists. If you're in the process of building your survival stockpile, now is the time to start stockpiling honey. Here are a few key reasons why: Bee decline: a growing concern Bees are facing a serious decline in population worldwide, with major consequences for agriculture and ecosystems. One major cause is habitat loss driven by urban development and intensive farming practices, which destroy the natural foraging and nesting areas of bees, according to Alexandra Zissu of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). (Related: Bees declared ""the most important living being on the planet,"" but they may soon be extinct .) Other major threats to bees include the use of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, and diseases like colony collapse disorder (CCD). These issues lead to high mortality rates and reproductive problems among bee populations. (Related: Neonicotinoids and pyrazoles are killing off honeybees, scientists discover .) Bees are essential pollinators for a large portion of flowering plants, including key crops like almonds, apples and berries. Bee population decline threatens crop yields as well as global food security and biodiversity. To combat this decline, efforts are underway which are focused on restoring habitats, reducing pesticide use, supporting organic farming and advocating for policies that protect these crucial pollinators. Surge in honey prices In recent years, honey prices have been steadily increasing due to economic and environmental factors. The main cause is the decline in bee population, which directly affects honey production. As bees continue to suffer, honey supplies also decrease, leading to higher costs for beekeepers. According to The Honey Association, poor harvests in key regions like Australia, Eastern Europe and the U.S., combined with rising demand in countries like China and India, have also contributed to the global honey shortage. Additionally, growing consumer preference for organic raw honey has further driven prices up. With demand rising and supplies shrinking, honey prices are expected to keep climbing. Investing in honey now could be a smart move as prices are not likely to drop any time soon. By buying from reputable sources that support sustainable beekeeping, consumers can enjoy high-quality honey while helping protect bee populations. Hidden crisis of ""fake"" honey The global honey industry is facing a significant but underreported issue: fake or adulterated honey. It is estimated that 30 percent of the honey on the global market is mixed with sugars, and up to 70 percent of honey sold in the U.S. could be fraudulent, according to Pass the Honey . This surge in counterfeit honey, which is often diluted with sugar syrups, poses a major challenge to both consumers and genuine honey producers. Such practices not only degrade the quality of honey but also shake consumer confidence in the product . China has been highlighted as a significant source of fake honey, with reports showing that much of its honey exports are either adulterated or mislabeled to cut production costs. Fake honey lacks the nutritional value of real honey, being low in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, and may even contain harmful substances. To ensure you’re getting the real deal, buy honey from reputable sources that disclose their production methods. Labels like ""raw"" or ""unfiltered"" suggest minimal processing, which means the honey is more likely to be authentic. Opting for local honey can also help guarantee quality and purity. Honey in your prepper pantry As a survival item, honey offers many advantages: Infinite shelf life. One of honey’s most notable benefits for individuals prepping for the long term is its incredible longevity. Honey's impressive shelf life is due to its unique properties: Its low moisture content and high acidity provides an unfavorable environment for bacteria and other microorganisms, making honey perfect for extended storage. When kept in a cool, dry place, raw honey can last indefinitely. Nutritional value . More than just a natural sweetener, honey is a nutrient powerhouse. While its nutrient content varies depending on several factors, honey consistently offers a wealth of essential nutrients and health-supporting phytonutrients, such as amino acids, enzymes, flavonoids and phenolic acids. A tablespoon of raw honey typically provides 64 calories plus carbohydrates (primarily simple sugars), vitamins A, C, D and E and B vitamins like thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3) and pantothenic acid (B5). Honey also delivers important trace minerals, such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and zinc. (Related: Manuka honey: A versatile superfood that does not expire .) Instant energy source. Honey is a versatile and valuable resource for preppers. It can serve as an excellent energy booster -- thanks to its carbohydrate content -- especially during emergencies. You can consume honey directly or add it to recipes for a quick boost in energy. Unlike sugar or corn syrup, honey offers both fast-acting glucose for immediate energy and slow-absorbing fructose for sustained fuel. With a lower glycemic index than table sugar, raw honey is a better choice for managing blood sugar levels. Medicinal properties. Honey’s medicinal properties are another major benefit. Its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory qualities have been known for centuries, with the ancient Greeks and Romans using it to treat wounds. In survival situations where medical care is limited, honey can be used to protect wounds from infections. Many types of honey, especially Manuka honey, produce hydrogen peroxide, which helps inactive microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and fungi. Beyond wound care, honey has been used historically to treat digestive issues like vomiting and diarrhea. Honey is also a great natural remedy for chapped lips and cracked fingers and works well on wind-burnt skin. Culinary versatility. Honey’s natural properties make it an effective food preservative. Its high sugar, low moisture content and acidic pH create an environment that inhibits bacterial and mold growth, helping to preserve food and extend its shelf life. Honey antioxidants also contribute to maintaining food quality over time. Choosing the best honey To get the most out of honey, it’s important to choose the right type. Raw honey is the top choice, as it’s full of pollen, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that offer both nutritional and medicinal advantages. Its naturally cloudy look is a sign of purity, and whether it’s liquid or crystallized, raw honey is great for medicinal use. (Related: Food supply 101: How to buy and store honey, the ultimate survival food .) Commercial honey , which is often pasteurized and filtered to give it a clear appearance, may look appealing, but it lacks the medicinal properties of raw honey. Another option is comb honey , which comes directly from the hive and includes raw honey stored in wax cells. It offers the same benefits as raw honey, and you can sometimes buy it with a piece of the comb in the jar. To ensure your honey is truly raw and natural, try these simple tests: Heat test. Light a matchstick and touch it to the honey. Raw honey won’t burn, but processed honey might because it’s been liquefied. Thumb test. Place a small amount of honey on your thumb. Raw honey should be thick and should stay in place without running off. Vinegar test. Mix a bit of honey with distilled vinegar. If it foams, it’s likely pasteurized or refined, not raw. Water test. Drop some honey into a glass of water. Raw honey will sink to the bottom without dissolving, while processed honey will spread out and dissolve quickly. Honey is a valuable addition to your survival stockpile due to its many uses, so stock up on raw honey while you can and maintain a generous supply. When stored correctly, honey can last indefinitely. When buying honey, opt for raw, unfiltered honey that is sustainably sourced and harvested by local beekeepers.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-un-pact-for-the-future.html,"UN ‘pact for the future’: Digital IDs, vaccine passports, massive censorship","World leaders will convene later this month in New York to discuss proposals that critics believe will enshrine global digital ID and online censorship and give the United Nations (U.N.) secretary-general unprecedented emergency powers. (Article by Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) Proposals to be discussed at the 79th U.N. General Assembly include the Pact for the Future , described by the U.N. as an “opportunity to create international mechanisms that better reflect the realities of the 21st century and can respond to today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and opportunities.” The proposed Pact for the Future encompasses 11 policy proposals . These include proposals for the establishment of a U.N. “ Emergency Platform ” and a “ Global Digital Compact ,” and policy proposals on “ Information Integrity ” and “ Transforming Education .” Also among the U.N.’s proposals is the “ Declaration on Future Generations .” Under these proposals, the secretary-general would have “ standing authority ” to declare “an Emergency Platform in the event of a future complex global shock of sufficient scale, severity and reach.” Discussions for the Pact for the Future will take place under the auspices of the Summit of the Future , described as “a high-level event , bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future.” The proposals are part of “ Our Common Agenda ,” an initiative described as “the Secretary-General’s vision for the future of global cooperation.” ‘Lack of checks and balances is very worrying’ Critics of the proposals warned The Defender that they threaten personal and health freedom, will grant the U.N. unprecedented powers and may lead to an internationally binding treaty. Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst said the U.N. is attempting to attain “more executive power.” Francis Boyle, J.D., Ph.D. , professor of international law at the University of Illinois, told The Defender, “What the secretary-general is trying to do is an end run around the United Nations charter and delegate to himself all the powers he can possibly assume.” “The lack of checks and balances is very worrying. The member states will have very little or no power,” Terhorst said, noting that these proposals are drawing increasing opposition as they threaten national sovereignty . The emergency powers and other proposals contained in the pact may have ominous consequences for humanity, Boyle warned. “The most pernicious [outcomes] would certainly be extremely dangerous vaccines that probably would violate the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation , such as these mRNA vaccines , and then also censorship , outright censorship for anyone who dissents ,” Boyle said. Other experts warned the U.N. is not being fully transparent. According to independent journalist James Roguski , “The U.N. is not being fully transparent about the process leading up to the Summit of the Future. At this time, a consensus agreement has not been reached and the status of the three documents has not been honestly presented to the general public.” Roguski noted that a fourth revision of the Global Digital Compact was drafted Aug. 27 but “has not been made publicly available on the U.N. website.” And according to Dr. Meryl Nass, founder of Door to Freedom , the pact “puts the U.N. ‘at the center’ of international affairs, giving the U.N. unspecified powers.” It contains no definitions for the terms used, “allowing it to be interpreted later in ways citizens may not like.” A means of ‘turbocharging’ the ‘Great Reset’? Critics also connected the U.N.’s proposals to the agendas of other international organizations, such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), which promoted the “ Great Reset ” and “ Fourth Industrial Revolution .” “In spirit, the Summit and Pact for the Future is a relaunch of the Great Reset,” said Tim Hinchliffe , publisher of The Sociable . “Both talk about reshaping our world, which includes a desire to transform the financial system and to implement global governance surrounding issues such as climate change, healthcare and all things related to the SDGs” ( Sustainable Development Goals ). “While the WEF has no direct, authoritative or legislative power to carry out its agendas, the Pact for the Future would be signed by member states whose governments wield actual executive and legislative powers,” Hinchliffe said. “What they are trying to do is to take the WEF agenda … and turn it into solid international law and from there into solid domestic law,” Boyle said. According to Michael Rectenwald, Ph.D. , author of “ The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty : Unraveling the Global Agenda,” the U.N.’s proposals “have been written in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the ‘global governance’ regime that it aims to establish.” Rectenwald said the proposals involve “accelerating the achievement of the SDGs” and represent the U.N.’s continued “attempt to establish a global socialist world system that is ‘inclusive’ and ‘equitable.’” “‘Inclusion’ is achieved through such technological means as closing the ‘digital divide,’ which depends on the universal adoption of a digital identity system . Digital identity is the means by which one is ‘included’ and without which one essentially does not exist. Thus, there is to be nothing outside the system — i.e., totalitarian governance ,” Rectenwald said. Global Digital Compact calls for digital IDs, vaccine passports Accompanying the Pact for the Future is a proposal for “A Global Digital Compact — an Open, Free and Secure Digital Future for All .” Published May 2023, the proposed compact sets out “principles, objectives and actions for advancing an open, free, secure and human-centred digital future, one that is anchored in universal human rights and that enables the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.” However, the compact contains proposals for the introduction of digital ID , “ digital public goods ” and “ digital product passports ,” and calls for “ addressing disinformation ” and preventing the “misuse” of online tools. “With digital ID, it is easier for governments to censor and threaten voices with a different opinion,” Terhorst said. “In the U.N. proposals, suppressing ‘disinformation’ or ‘hateful speech’ is mentioned. Who is to decide what information is right and what is wrong?” “ Information Integrity on Digital Platforms ” policy brief goes further, specifically addressing “threats to information integrity,” such as so-called “misinformation” and “disinformation.” It also calls for “empirically-backed consensus around facts, science and knowledge,” but does not clarify how this “consensus” would be determined. Similarly, a policy brief on “ Transforming Education ,” proposes “incorporating practices that strengthen the ability of learners and teachers to navigate the increasing flow of false and fake information.” The compact also proposes “Novel platform-based vaccine technologies and smart vaccine manufacturing techniques … to produce greater numbers of higher-quality vaccines.” Terhorst said the goal of digital ID is to introduce global vaccine passports that would “overrule the right of everyone to say no to a vaccination .” Hinchliffe noted that the U.N. has “established principles for a ‘ Code of Conduct ‘ that calls on not just member states, but private groups such as stakeholders , digital platforms, advertisers, and news media to crush narratives that go against the U.N. and the SDGs.” Secretary-general ‘trying to set himself up as the UN dictator’ According to Boyle, the U.N. secretary-general is “supposed to function as a secretary in charge of the secretariat,” but these proposals are trying to “set himself up as the U.N. dictator.” He noted that the U.N. is composed of six independent organs , but said these proposals may usurp their independence. “He would have authority over them and arguably could exert authority over U.N. specialized agencies like the World Health Organization. That ties in with the International Health Regulations and the Pandemic Treaty ,” Boyle said. Boyle argued that by specifically referring to the Pact for the Future as a “pact,” the U.N. is intentionally “trying to turn this into an international treaty that is binding” under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties . “If you call it a pact … that would clearly fall within the terms of the Vienna Convention,” Boyle said. “We’re in the fight of our lives here. The world has to be alerted to the dangers of this pact.” Read more at: ChildrensHealthDefense.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-kamala-supports-gender-mutilation-illegals-detention-centers.html,Kommie “Freakshow” Kamala supports U.S. taxpayer-funded GENDER MUTILATION SURGERY for illegal immigrants at detention centers,"Many young people today are being brainwashed by social media that they “surf” all day, not only damaging their vision, their cognition and their concept of reality, but their image of self. Since nearly all social media is run by extreme liberals, it is a hub of lecherous and salacious content, chock full of the latest transexual and “gender fluid” posts, pictures and propaganda convincing them that it is normal and trendy to think about sex, sex partners, sexuality and “switching” genders. This includes foreign children and teenagers migrating to the United States in hope of a better life, lifestyle and opinion of themselves. In comes Kommie “Freakshow” Harris, the U.S. southern border “Czar” with her perverted agenda , billions of taxpayer dollars to push it, and the most extreme plan for perverting every child and teenager in the country, including illegal immigrants who are temporarily stuck in detention centers. You can’t make this stuff up. In fact, most people would immediately claim this is a conspiracy theory, until they see the policy plan literally published and posted on Kommie Kamala’s campaign position list and aired out on CNN. Kommie Kamala’s communist ways of wrecking the nuclear family, children’s dreams and a normal life are all documented and real, unfortunately Does anyone really want a President who is “all in” for children, teenagers and young adults to get genitalia mutilation surgery, take cancer-causing hormone drugs, and become promiscuous at very early ages? Make no mistake, this horrific influence Kamala propagates is perverted and part of a much larger agenda that fosters human trafficking, sex slavery and people who regret their gender alterations so badly that they consider and/or commit suicide. Kommie Kamala has campaign positions that will not change, though she has recently claimed some will, just to win votes. She is an extreme liberal, a Marxist, and totally supports the gender-mutilation-surgery movement that is ruining people’s lives, including young kids who don’t understand the dangerous implications and consequences. In 2019, the Harris campaign position supported “taxpayer-funded gender care and transition surgeries for detained migrants.” Let that sink in for a minute. As she decreases funding for ICE (border security), she increases funding for illegal immigrants to undergo gender “transition” surgery while in detention centers, and then releases them into the custody of unvetted “agencies” who can easily turn them into prostitutes, sex slaves, abused minors and trafficked victims (who often disappear or get killed). Plus, many kids and teens who get their penis removed, breasts removed and permanent surgery performed on their facial features end up regretting it, unable to use the bathroom properly, suffer complete libido loss and damage to their self-esteem, forever. With all the illegal aliens entering the United States who are criminals, drug dealers, rapists and mental cases (released from other countries’ prisons around the world), Kommie Kamala would rather spend billions in U.S. taxpayer funds to mutilate kids’ genitals at detention centers than to prevent this national security disaster from continuing. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican or Independent, you should be very concerned about this, and voting against it. This could affect yours and your children’s livelihoods directly, permanently, and regrettably if you don’t act now to stop it. Tune your internet dial to Gender.news for updates on extreme liberals with hidden agendas trying to turn normal kids, including illegal immigrants, into gender-confused, genitalia-mutilated freaks. #StopKommieKamala "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-japan-destroy-world-self-amplifying-rna-vaccine.html,How Japan plans to destroy the world with new “self-amplifying” RNA “vaccine”,"At some point in the next few weeks, Japan will unleash a new abomination that could be the final component in the trans-humanizing of the planet. Known as Replican, this new ""self-amplifying"" RNA injection makes copies of itself in perpetuity before producing proteins that scientists claim will cause the human body to produce antibodies to disease. Different from the spike protein-based mRNA (modRNA) ""vaccines"" unleashed through Operation Warp Speed, Replicon is able to self-replicate itself without altering cell DNA, though it can still result in reverse transcription and DNA alteration. ""The current COVID-19 mRNA injections don't officially have the ability to self replicate (unless they get integrated into a person's DNA),"" explains Dr. Daniel Nagase, M.D., on his ""Logical Surprises"" Substack. ""If the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA is reverse transcribed and alters a cell's DNA, only then does it attain the ability to replicate through cell division. (Every time a gene altered cell divides, it makes a copy of the Pfizer or Moderna gene(s)."" Check out the following video from Dr. Nagase in which he explains further how mRNA injections cause serious genetic damage: (Related: We we warned , this self-replicating RNA abomination is about to go live .) Destroying life by permanently altering the gene pool Only over the past couple of days did Dr. Nagase finally come to realize just how profoundly dangerous Replicon truly is. Based on naturally occurring alphaviruses, Replicon has the capacity to forever change the human genome of not just people who receive it directly, but also others who get ""shed"" on by someone who got jabbed. ""While I knew that a self replicating vaccine was dangerous, I initially thought that if people had pre-existing antibodies to naturally occurring [sic] Alphaviruses (that the self replicating vaccine is based upon), healthy people might be able to carry enough Alphavirus antibodies to neutralize any self replicating RNA shed from people who took the Replicon or other self amplifying RNA 'vaccines,'"" Dr. Nagase writes. ""Obtaining natural alphavirus antibodies would be most easily done by frequent natural exposures to mosquito bites. However, my thoughts about natural ways to protect against the Replicon 'vaccines' only looked at a part of the problem. There was another much greater danger that only occurred to me in the past couple days."" The fact that Replicon and the technology behind it was hatched in 2020 right around the time when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic"" was unleashed speaks volumes about what the globalist plan for humanity might really be. Dr. Nagase is concerned about the ""environmental hardiness"" of the alphaviruses used in the vaccine lends to the possibility that deadly new outbreaks will occur that can cross between species. He warns that once unleashed, these deadly abominations could result in the entire global ecosystem of life becoming permanently altered by ""artificial genes."" The scientists involved in developing self-replicating RNA technology have continually over the years ignored all warning signs that the end result could be a mass extinction event of unfathomable proportions. It is almost as if this was the plan all along. The recombination potential alone of the many alphaviruses used in the technology suggest that the final solution is to destroy all life by chemically and genetically altering the entire planet. ""Because alphaviruses in the wild cross species into other animals and mosquitoes, any human who gets a Replicon injection can transmit Replicon genes not just to other people, they can transfer Replicon genetic material to other species,"" Dr. Nagase warns. ""This can happen either through a mosquito, or through recombination when a Replicon patient gets an infection with another species like coronavirus, influenza virus or other alphavirus species. Every instance when someone infected with a Replicon gets another virus while that Replicon is still in the body, presents the Replicon an opportunity to exit the patient and infect another person or animal using that other virus.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-bill-gates-wants-ai-censor-vaccine-misinfo.html,Bill Gates wants AI algorithms to censor vaccine “misinformation” in real time,"Microsoft co-founder, eugenics proponent, and decaying wrinkle-face Bill Gates wants to merge his vaccine obsession with artificial intelligence (AI) to control what gets said online. In a recent interview with CNBC , Gates explained that while he is a vaccine absolutist, he feels much different about free speech and the First Amendment, which he wants to see curtailed through whatever means possible. Gates feels as though the U.S. Constitution and its free speech protections are no longer applicable, and that ""boundaries"" and ""rules"" are needed to stop the spread of ""misinformation"" online and elsewhere. The best way to rein in what people are allowed to say is to deploy an army of AI robots to immediately and in real time identify and remove everything from the internet that Gates and his friends feel constitutions ""fake news"" or ""incorrect information."" ""We should have free speech, but if you're inciting violence, if you're causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries that even the U.S. should have rules?"" Gates blathered during the interview. ""And then if you have rules, what is it?"" (Related: Did you know that Bill Gates is chomping at the bit to unleash climate ""vaccines"" on humanity?) Who does Bill Gates think he is? When pressed about who should have the authority to regulate speech, Gates was a bit more elusive, though he seems to think that he and people who think the same way as him should hold the levers of power. ""Is there some AI that encodes those rules because you have billions of activity [sic] and if you catch it a day later, the harm is done,"" Gates commented. Gates thinks so highly of himself and his own viewpoints and opinions that he is on a press tour right now promoting a new Netflix ""docuseries"" called ""What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates"" that we are told will have at least five parts. The guy apparently fails to realize that nobody likes him or cares what he thinks, but when has a billionaire ever been in touch with reality? Perhaps Americans would do well to consider ""the past with Bill Gates"" before they decide to take the plunge with him into some dystopian future ruled by AI robots with programmed censorship as their primary mission. ""We can see Windows, which he now tells CNBC he was allegedly naïve about and thought it would only be used for 'productive and responsible purposes' as most people would want to have a computer at home,"" writes Didi Rankovic for Reclaim the Net . ""What they got with Windows, however, is a problem in its own way, – while Microsoft was seen by critics as going after open-source competition like a monopolistic, anti-competitive corporate bully. But here is Gates now, to tell us what our future should look like."" Last year on his blog, Gates declared that ""The Age of AI has begun."" In a post, he wrote that AI ""will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other."" ""Entire industries will reorient around it,"" Gates added. ""Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it."" Gates feels as though AI can help children get a better education, especially ""Black, Latino, and low-income students."" ""AI can help turn that trend around,"" Gates contends. The biggest area where Gates wants AI to take control is with climate change. Gates believes that AI programmed to address ""the injustice of"" climate change will ""make the world more equitable.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-study-warns-hormone-disrupting-chemicals-skincare.html,Study warns of hormone-disrupting chemicals in children’s skincare products,"As our awareness of the toxins present in our daily lives grows, many parents are going out of their way to limit their children’s exposure, whether it’s by scrutinizing food labels or avoiding plastics. However, one area that is often overlooked is skincare, and an eye-opening new study shows that many common products geared toward young children contain dangerous hormone-disrupting chemicals. In a press release, George Mason University College of Public Health Professor Michael Bloom shared the findings of the study he led, cautioning: “We found associations between recent use of different skin care products and higher concentrations of phthalate and phthalate-replacement compounds.” Phthalates are known for disrupting the human endocrine system and interfering with hormones, which is something that is particularly concerning in children, whose systems are still developing. These chemicals are often added to skincare products to improve qualities such as absorption and lubrication and make their fragrances last longer. More than 600 children between the ages of 4 and 8 participated in the study across 10 clinical sites in the U.S., which entailed physical exams and urinalysis to detect the presence of phthalate byproducts in their bodies. The children's parents disclosed the skincare products that they had used on them during the 24 hours prior to examination, including shampoos, lotions, soaps, sunscreens and cosmetics. According to the researchers, the use of skincare products in the study's participants was frequent, with most of them using at least one type of lotion and soap. The study revealed that exposure to these toxins is linked to differences in immune function, neurodevelopment, body composition and pulmonary function. Although the researchers conceded that the evidence cannot be considered definitive right now, parents should proceed with caution given the many health hazards that have already been associated with phthalates. The researchers also broke down their findings based on race and ethnicity. They found that black children had the highest rate of phthalates in their urine, potentially because of how frequently they used products or the types of products they used. Parents need to be vigilant when it comes to the ingredients in children’s skincare products Bloom, who has worked on a number of other studies looking into the dangers of these chemicals, said that parents should check product labels carefully to identify any toxic ingredients and conduct research online to find out more about the skincare products they are considering purchasing. Some of the most common phthalates consumers might see on ingredient labels include monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP), but it is important to keep in mind that current FDA regulations do not require product manufacturers to list the individual flavors or fragrances they use in their products and their specific ingredients as this is considered proprietary information. This means that it can be hard to tell whether there are phthalates in the fragrances used in products. The best approach, therefore, is to avoid products that contain scents and flavors. It is also possible for these toxins to migrate from the plastic packaging of skincare products into the product itself. Bloom suggested that policy changes may need to be implemented to limit children's exposure to these chemicals. It is also worth noting that some phthalate replacement compounds that are used instead of phthalates may also be toxic. Bloom's study did not look directly into the health risks associated with these chemicals, but previous studies have shown their impact on hormone function as well as their ability to induce inflammation and oxidative stress. From metabolic disease to reproductive problems, numerous toxic effects have been linked to the use of these chemicals. Although more studies are needed, it can be a tricky topic to navigate given the ethical concerns involved in studying exposure to phthalates in children . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-family-lawsuit-colorado-daughter-share-bedroom-transgender.html,Family files lawsuit against Colorado school district for forcing daughter to share bedroom with transgender student during field trip,"A family in Colorado has filed a lawsuit against a school district that forced their daughter to share a bedroom with a transgender student . The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) stated that it filed a federal lawsuit against Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) for forcing several girls to share sleeping arrangements with a transgender student, contending that education officials have committed flagrant violations of parental rights. The incident occurred in December 2023, when JCPS assigned the 11-year-old daughter of parents Joe and Serena Wailes to share not only a room but a bed with a transgender student and directed her not to tell her parents about the student's gender status. Luckily, her mother had been a chaperone on the trip, and after some unsuccessful tries to move her daughter was able to have the gender confused student transferred to a different room. (Related: Minor girls labeled ""transphobic"" after speaking out against LGBT boys using their locker rooms .) ""This time, the chaperones agreed to move [the student] and one other girl to a different room but again lied about why, saying [a] sick roommate needed more space,"" ADF stated at that time in a demand letter seeking clarification of the district's policies. ""Throughout the entire evening, [the student's] privacy and feelings were always the primary concern of JCPS employees."" The Wailes sent two letters to the school district requesting JCPS permit parents to opt their children out of any policy ahead of an overnight trip that rooms children by gender identity rather than sex . They alleged the school district denied their request. Parent calls for complete transparency from schools on information directly affecting children Serena said in an interview with Fox News Digital that parents should have complete transparency from schools on information that directly affects their children. ""We never thought our daughter would be put in a situation like this, or we would be forced to ask our own school district to stop hiding information regarding our children's privacy and safety, but the need for transparency and trust toward our school district is critical,"" she said. ""Parents, not the government, have the right and duty to direct the upbringing and education of their children, and that includes making informed decisions to protect their child's privacy,"" ADF attorney Kate Anderson stated. ""This fundamental right is especially vital for parents to protect their children from violations of bodily privacy by exposure to the opposite sex in intimate settings, like sleeping arrangements or shower facilities."" ""If Jefferson County Public Schools is going to continue placing students of the opposite sex in the same room on overnight trips – as it confirmed it would – the district must let parents be the ones to make decisions about their children's privacy. And they must provide the information necessary and inform parents about the policy so parents can make the best decisions for their children,"" she continued. ""The district must grant our clients' reasonable request for accommodations that can be accomplished in a number of confidential ways that protect the privacy of all students.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-pharma-companies-bribing-doctors-early-in-career.html,Playing the long game: Pharma companies are reportedly BRIBING doctors early on in their career,"Pharmaceutical companies that make drugs and medical devices are reportedly giving subtle bribes to doctors early on in their career . A report published Sept. 9 in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) disclosed the extent of this corruption by Big Pharma. The said piece was written by Alice Fabbri of the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Quinn Grundy of the University of Toronto in Canada. ""Drug and medical device industries globally continue to target clinicians early in their careers – including during periods of training – to cultivate long-term, reciprocal relationships through payments, free meals and sponsored education,"" they wrote. ""Industry influence still threatens the integrity of healthcare and harms patients."" One study cited by Fabbri and Grundy examined payments to more than 5,000 cardiology fellows in the United States. The said paper published Sept. 1 in JAMA Internal Medicine looked at these fellows before and after graduating from medical school. The study found that of the more than 5,000 cardiology fellows examined, 73 percent received ""industry marketing payments"" (IMPs) in the year before graduating. Meanwhile, 88 percent received IMPs in the first few years after they graduated. (Related: 65% of doctors are getting cash ""kickbacks"" from big pharma. ) ""IMPs to physicians may compromise the objectivity and integrity of clinical decision-making, playing a role in non-recommended care, higher health costs and reduced patient trust,"" the JAMA Internal Medicine study stated. ""Payments to trainees merit scrutiny because these payments may be formative on future practice."" Fabbri and Grundy also referenced an internal company document from the late 1990s, which outlined a plan "" to influence physicians from the bottom up ."" The said memo published by drugmaker Parke-Davis sought to solidify the company's ""role in the resident's mind as [they evolve] into a practicing physician."" According to the BMJ piece, the Parke-Davis memo reportedly became public ""through litigation around off-label drug promotion."" Drug company Warner-Lambert acquired Parke-Davis in the 1970s, and Pfizer later acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 – with Parke-Davis included in the deal. Separate study finds 12 categories of IMPs (read: bribes) to doctors Meanwhile, a study published December 2018 in the Journal of Osteopathic Medicine (JOM) scrutinized data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database for calendar year 2015. The study authors found that almost 82,000 payments were made to approximately 12,000 cardiologists. These IMPs for 2015 amounted to a total of $13.9 million. The authors of the December 2018 study also found that upon closer scrutiny, IMPs to cardiologists fell into one of 12 categories . The categories are as follows: Charitable contribution Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program Compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a non-accredited and non-certified continuing education program Consulting fee Education Entertainment Food and beverage Gift Grant Honoraria Royalty or license Travel and lodging The JOM study also noted that a total of 45 companies submitted payments to a cardiologist for the year 2015. Anglo-Swedish drug company AstraZeneca made the highest overall payments, which were valued at $7.2 million. Its IMPs accounted for 51.85 percent of total payments to cardiologists for that year. Fabbri and Grundy noted, citing other papers on the matter, that IMPs influence doctors' decision making. ""Even the receipt of low value industry-sponsored meals is associated with increased prescribing of the promoted brand name medication,"" they wrote. The two ultimately warned in their BMJ report that increased drug promotion as a result of IMPs to doctors can negatively affect patients' health ""by contributing to over-, under- and mistreatment.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-15-kamala-supports-taxpayer-funded-transition-prisoners-migrants.html,CONFIRMED: Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained migrants,"A resurfaced 2019 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questionnaire with answers from Vice President Kamala Harris has revealed her support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners . Harris completed the ACLU questionnaire while she was running to win the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election. The questionnaire started making the rounds in August as Harris' campaign for the 2024 election took off. In the questionnaire, Harris was asked if, as president, she would use executive authority to ensure transgender and nonbinary people under state care, including those in prisons and immigration detention centers, have access to comprehensive medical treatments associated with gender transition. (Related: Kamala Harris to reduce illegal immigration by LEGALIZING it, not stopping it .) Harris affirmed her support, stating, ""Yes."" ""It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition. That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates,"" she explained in a detailed follow-up. ""Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment."" 2019 ACLU questionnaire reveals Harris' stance on other left-wing issues The 2019 ACLU questionnaire also revealed Harris' stance on several left-wing issues . Besides endorsing surgeries for transgender detainees, Harris also voiced support for decriminalizing federal drug possession for personal use and substantial cuts to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, including a pledge to ""end"" immigration detention. In that same questionnaire, Harris advocated for ending immigration detention facilities and private prisons, reducing funding for ICE and halting ICE detainers. Harris described the U.S. immigrant detention system as ""out of control"" and called for an end to the ""unfair incarceration"" of thousands of individuals, families and children. Harris also cited her early opposition to increased ICE funding following the election of former President Donald Trump in 2017. In 2018, Harris introduced the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act, which seeks to increase oversight of ICE detention facilities, reduce detention by at least 50 percent and prevent the construction or expansion of new facilities. She also pledged to end the use of ICE detainers at the time. ""As president, I will focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not tearing apart immigrant families. This includes requiring ICE to obtain a warrant where probable cause exists as to end the use of detainers,"" she wrote. The questionnaire also revealed Harris' progressive stance on drug policy reform. She called for the decriminalization of all drug possession for personal use and co-sponsored the Marijuana Justice Act to legalize marijuana federally. In her response to the ACLU, Harris stressed treating drug addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. ""Throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses,"" she wrote.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-pfizer-mobile-science-brainwashing-truck-children.html,Pfizer’s mobile science brainwashing truck targets children with “escape-room-like” vaccine production simulation,"Pfizer has become more blatant than ever in pushing vaccines on the masses with an absurd new mobile science brainwashing truck that convinces young people that their toxic jabs will somehow save humanity. It targets children aged 9 to 14 and boasts “a scientific adventure like no other.” In a promotional video, students in a rural North Carolina town can be seen taking part in what Pfizer calls the “School of Science Mobile Experience,” where a Pfizer robot dog greets them and interacts with them. The brainwashing truck promises a “fantastic, interactive, escape-room-like experience,” and as much as we’d all like to escape from any room where people are pushing untested vaccines on us, the idea here is that vaccines are the solution to a worrying pandemic outbreak that leaves people with lizard-like skin. During the exercise, children are taught various “lessons” in the scary trailer’s assorted rooms. For example, one teaches about vaccine manufacturing, while another explains the concepts of antigens. They also get the opportunity to meet Pfizer employees through the School of Science, even though we doubt this ranks on any child’s list of idols they’d like to meet one day. The North Carolina students ultimately “successfully produced a remedy that will be distributed around the world” in the simulation, according to the promotional video, and we suspect it has more than a few similarities to the company’s highly profitable COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer accused of directly marketing vaccines to children One educator accused the pharmaceutical company of shilling its vaccines to young people via the truck, with New York city educator and Teachers for Choice founder Michael Kane stating: “It’s definitely crossing a line from education to directly marketing or promoting their products to kids. It just feels so wrong.” A North Carolina parent, Beth Secosky, told The Defender that Pfizer should not be teaching science to children. She pointed out: “Pfizer has paid billions in penalties for false claims and safety violations. Why would schools invite a corporation that is notorious for putting profits over people to teach their children ‘science’?” Pfizer working hard to inculcate the next generation of customers The mobile brainwashing unit is part of the Pfizer School of Science , which has hosted middle school students at the pharmaceutical giant’s New York City headquarters, where they are subjected to 90-minute “courses” about subjects such as vaccine history, drug manufacturing, immunology and the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare, with Pfizer footing the bill. They also hear pitches from employees about future careers with the company. CEO Albert Bourla claims that more than 6,000 students from New York City with “diverse backgrounds” have gone to its headquarters for these programs, writing on LinkedIn that they go out of their way to brainwash as many young people as possible. “In some cases, this meant modifying our coursework to accommodate diverse needs, such as customizing classes to suit different learning abilities and language capabilities,” he wrote. They’ve been pushing hard to appeal to younger generations in recent years, celebrating their version of “science” not just with their School of Science but also in a Super Bowl ad that aired in January with famous scientists singing along to the Queen hit ""Don’t Stop Me Now."" At the time, their chief marketing officer, Drew Panayiotou, boasted that the “iconic Queen song … cuts across generations with the words ‘don’t stop me now,’ which is a great line for Pfizer.” Considering the record-breaking profits they earned thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines that were forced on so many people around the world, it won’t be surprising if Pfizer goes even further moving forward in their bold efforts to brainwash future generations of vaccine and drug customers.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-vaxxed-3-exposes-injuries-deaths-vaccines-hospital-protocols.html,Upcoming VAXXED 3 documentary exposes widespread injuries and deaths caused by vaccines and hospital protocols,"On September 18, 2024, Children’s Health Defense will be releasing “ Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill. ” This jarring documentary exposes widespread injuries and deaths caused by vaccines and hospital protocols that were mandated during the covid-19 scandal. The documentary includes serious testimony from over a thousand interviews with everyday people, including medical professionals, whistleblowers and family members whose lives were shattered by the hospital protocols and mandatory vaccines. The documentary is a culmination of testimonies gathered over a period of nine months, during which the Children’s Health Defense team traveled across the United States in a bus, documenting stories of vaccine injury, medical error and wrongful death . “These were fundamental violations of human rights,” said Kim Mack Rosenberg, CHD general counsel. These human rights abuses led to medical atrocities at scale. The reality of widespread iatrogenic error and vaccine holocaust cannot be censored From the documentary, these realities become imperative to understand during this government-mandated crisis*: The hospital protocols mandated by Dr. Anthony Fauci during the COVID-19 emergency declaration were systematically destructive to people’s lives. Widespread use of faulty covid-19 tests caused mass hysteria, leading to further isolation procedures that were harmful and/or unnecessary. The isolation procedures separated family members from one another, putting patients in a vulnerable position, with no one to speak on their behalf. These isolation procedures often denied patients the right to advocates and nurses who are instrumental in speaking up for patients and reporting medical malpractice. Many hospital patients also need faith leaders by their side to navigate the stark reality of suffering and dying, but isolation procedures created a faithless environment where many were left hopeless and alone in their final hours. In the isolation, mandatory government and hospital protocols did not address individual patient needs and failed to provide timely treatments and a variety of individualized treatments that could help the patient survive the infection or lessen its duration and severity. Due to all infections being labeled COVID-19 with a positive PCR test result, many underlying health issues and pathologies went unaddressed, and the wrong treatments were prescribed. This led to worse outcomes and suffering. Many immune-modulating therapies and efficacious treatments for infection were suppressed throughout the scandal, and things like remdesivir, ventilators and sedation were used by default, with deleterious results. Widespread use of ventilators perpetuated nosocomial pneumonia, which took the lives of unsuspecting individuals. Hospitals that used remdesivir were awarded $3,000 per patient, despite evidence that it was destroying patients' kidney function. Hospitals also received financial incentives for swabbing patients at their door and getting a positive test result, despite there being no symptom specific diagnostic criteria. The censorship of hydroxychloroquine , zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D , ivermectin and herbal antivirals caused viral load to worsen for many patients, and healthcare professionals often prescribed heavy drug protocols that did more damage to their organs. The censorship of early treatment was a calculated plan that paved the way for emergency use authorization of COVID-19 “vaccines” that caused even more health problems and hospitalizations. The vaccines were drastically unsafe and caused typical vaccine adverse events like Guillain Barr Syndrome, seizures and anaphylaxis, along with new cases of heart inflammation ( myocarditis and pericarditis ), enhanced respiratory disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and other neurological conditions, and organ failure. The vaccines have also destroyed human immune function, suppressing facets of the immune system that are designed to protect against cancer, while activating oncogenes and aggressive forms of turbo cancer . COVID-19 vaccines were NOT safe and effective , as was claimed by the media, the government and the medical community from the beginning. They did not stop transmission and oftentimes made people sick. The vaccines did not prevent severe disease -- a narrative that was perpetrated after medical authorities realized that the vaccines failed to stop transmission. Many people got severely ill from the vaccine and got severe infections in the weeks, months and years after being vaccinated. The unvaccinated were NOT responsible for the vaccines’ failures, as healthy immune response and recovery to infectious disease always confers a level of natural immunity that protects the individual, and therefore protects others who are immune-compromised. Patients were readily discriminated against by their vaccination status. Unvaccinated individuals were demonized to such a degree that they weren’t afforded the same level of care as those who complied with the hospital’s vaccine mandates. The COVID-19 vaccine, lockdowns and hospital protocols are linked with excess death worldwide . Military service members were persecuted, threatened with court martial and discharged for not going along with the vaccine mandates and lies. Some were injured and barred from speaking out. Some courageously found ways to stay in the military and remain unvaccinated. Individuals injured by vaccines were censored from public discourse online and were often dismissed by the medical community, leaving them voiceless and alone. Some individuals got the vaccine to comply with unlawful mandates, were injured by the vaccine and then were forced to continue getting boosters as a condition for continued employment. Many individuals were left injured and fired from their job, unable to work, and broke. Some vaccine injured individuals are in such pain that they have considered suicide. Healthcare professionals who resisted the government narratives were terminated, discriminated against/blacklisted and mocked, but many of these brave healthcare professionals are now giving a voice to those injured by mandatory hospital protocols and vaccines . Children's Health Defense and the growing health freedom community are uniting the people, as they fight for healing, liberty and justice.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-young-doctors-financially-enslaved-by-drug-industry.html,"Follow the money: Most young doctors are financially enslaved by the drug industry, and it’s destroying American healthcare","Those young, virtue-signaling doctors who went on social media to post a picture of themselves getting a COVID shot are the same types of doctors who sleazily accept gifts, freebies and bribes from drug companies, and then turn around and prescribe those drugs to you . A new study published in the British Medical Journal – Protecting early career physicians from commercial influence – finds a disturbing trend of young doctors being wined and dined and used as pawns to promote new drugs. This influence is pervasive, especially in the field of pain management and cardiology – two medical fields where underlying health issues are not properly diagnosed or treated. Study warns that drug companies are dictating healthcare through bribery The study finds that drug companies and medical device manufacturers target doctors early on in their careers. The doctors are enticed by lump sum payments, sponsored education, lavish meals and other career opportunities. In this corrupt environment, drug company representatives hope to “cultivate long term, reciprocal relationships.” “Ultimately, these relationships threaten the sustainability of healthcare and expose patients to unnecessary risk or harm,” says study authors Alice Fabbri, Ph.D., and Quinn Grundy, Ph.D. A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine tracked 5,533 new American cardiologists. A majority of them (73%) accepted “industry marketing payments” before they even graduated. A total of 88% of these went on to take checks from drug companies in the first few years after graduation. Only around 12% of new cardiologists remained independent of pharmaceutical industry influence. The drug industry influence expanded in medical fields that are “procedure intensive” and use more technology. The study found that 80% of doctors in these fields took money from Big Pharma before graduating, and up to 96% were taking money from drug companies in the first few years after graduation. More drug money payments are given to cardiologists than to any other type of specialist. In one of the studies, 184 of the 195 directors of cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories routinely took drug industry payments. Only 11 of these directors turned down Big Pharma money that calendar year. According to a 2018 analysis , industry payments received by cardiologists fall into 12 known categories, including: Food and beverage Entertainment Travel and lodging Consulting fee Gift Charitable contribution Compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a nonaccredited and noncertified continuing education program Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program Education Grant Honoraria Royalty or license Drug company money severely influences diagnostic and prescription practices of new doctors These payouts from Big Pharma ultimately influence a doctor’s decisions making, manipulating how they think, how they diagnose, and what they prescribe. “Even the receipt of low value industry-sponsored meals is associated with increased prescribing of the promoted brand name medication,” Fabbri and Grundy reported. A 2016 JAMA Internal Medicine study followed the prescription practices of 2,444 doctors and the influence of drug company propaganda on their prescription practices. The study found that as industry payments increased, doctors are more willing to blindly prescribe brand name statins. This hasty prescription practice can miss underlying factors and pathologies that are causing the cardiovascular issues in each patient. Blindly prescribing statins for every patient misses important cellular, hormonal and inflammatory indications, causing further health issues. Today, statins are being recommended to teenagers at age 15 if they show any sign of high cholesterol. The same trend can be observed with doctors increasing prescriptions of opioids for pain relief. Studies show that increasing drug industry payments encourages more doctors to prescribe opioids, ignoring the underlying issues for the pain and causing serious outcomes for patients. The same issues are going on in the cancer industry , the vaccine industry, etc. Medical schools complicit By design, medical schools fail to address this systemic issue , ignoring how this sleazy relationship harms the future of medical practices across the United States. By accepting drug company money, new doctors denigrate their own integrity, engaging in conflicts of interest that dumb down their potential, while threatening the future of patient care, as well as trust in the industry. “Educational interventions should challenge the common belief among health professionals that they are immune to commercial influence, teach them how to critically assess information received from industry … and point them to independent sources of prescribing information,” Fabbri and Grundy commented. Instead of accepting the collusion as normal, medical students must be trained to discern when relationships with the industry are hindering their ability to objectively address health issues in their patients.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-canadian-government-destroying-covid-mrna-jabs-eliminate-evidence.html,TOTAL RECALL: Canadian government DESTROYING all Covid mRNA jabs to eliminate evidence of genocidal crimes against humanity,"The authoritarian Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and his insidious health ministry cohorts at Health Canada are in the process of destroying every Covid jab they have in inventory right now. They claim it is happening because the shots are now worthless, since those strains of Covid are no longer circulating, and because they are preparing new clot shots for the next incoming wave of (insert Greek letter and number here) variants. But is that the truth? Most likely not. As Canada recalls, collects and destroys all their nanoparticle injections, including all those marketed by Pfizer and Moderna, many health analysts and reporters are calling it the greatest cover up and destruction of criminal evidence ever. When the masses of Canadians and other victims of vaccine violence around the world get wind of the cause of their injuries and forever symptoms (long-vax syndrome), and the deaths of the injected sheeple, there will be no evidence (besides autopsies) left to use in the new-age Nuremberg trials of the mass murderers who knew exactly what they were doing when they pushed these toxic jabs on the populace. Tens of millions of deadly Covid “vaccines” being recalled by the government for destruction now that the truth is coming out about self-assembling nanoparticles Leading government officials and politicians around the globe may be preparing for defending against their own prosecution for promoting and propagating the most violent and insidious weapon of mass destruction ever known – Covid “vaccinations.” In what appears to be a huge cover up and destruction of criminal evidence , health officials and politicians are collaborating to destroy every last Covid jab that still exists from the plandemic, so if and when they get caught for using them to kill millions of people, they won’t go to prison for life or get hung for it. For decades, vaccines (oral and injectable) have been found to be contaminated with all kinds of chemicals, live virus strains (think circovirus here), GMOs, infectious bacteria, human abortion cells, heavy metal toxins and much more. Now, scientists are discovering that mRNA jabs have the ability to cause rubbery vascular clots in the blood, invade vital organs and cause immense strain on the heart muscle. The problem is that Covid-19 “vaccines are synthetic gene therapy injections , and the technology does NOT meet the definition of traditional vaccines. They were never tested for long-term safety and failed the animal trials because vaccinated animals still died after they contracted the virus in the wild. Every day, thousands and thousands of humans are being injured and killed by these deadly gene-altering nanoparticle injections, and when the true death toll becomes obvious and published, the manufacturers and promoters of the jabs could be looking at serious prosecution for crimes against humanity, including genocide. Destroying evidence of these bioweapons is a violation of the criminal code in Canada, as it is in many other countries. As of last month, all provinces and territories in Canada were instructed to remove and destroy all current Covid-19 vaccine formulations (XBB) from all sites across their jurisdictions, according to a spokesperson at Alberta Health, as announced by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Someone, somewhere, needs to hang on to some of these death jabs for future reference as evidence of crimes against humanity for prosecuting these mass murderers.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-recognizing-the-early-warning-signs-of-stroke.html,Recognizing the early warning signs of stroke and how to prevent it,"A stroke is a serious condition affecting the brain’s blood supply. It happens when a blood vessel carrying oxygen to the brain becomes blocked or bursts, depriving the brain cells of essential nutrients and causing them to die. Recognizing the early warning signs of a stroke and taking preventive steps is crucial since strokes can strike suddenly. There are several different types of stroke, and all of them could be fatal : Ischemic stroke . This type, which makes up nearly 90 percent of strokes, occurs when the brain is deprived of blood flow because of a blood vessel blocked by a clot. Hemorrhagic stroke . This happens when a weakened blood vessel in the brain ruptures – often due to high blood pressure. It can be caused by aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Transient ischemic attack (TIA). Also referred to as a ""mini-stroke,"" a TIA is caused by a temporary clot. It is a warning sign for a future stroke and should be taken just as seriously as ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Cryptogenic stroke . This term is used for strokes that are idiopathic or whose causes are unknown. Brain stem stroke . A stroke in the brain stem can impact both sides of the body and may result in a ""locked-in"" state, where the person cannot move or speak below the neck. Key warning signs of a stroke To quickly identify a stroke , health care experts are advising people to remember the acronym ""F.A.S.T.,"" which stands for: Face drooping . Notice if one side of the face droops or feels numb. Ask the potentially affected person to smile and if the smile is uneven, this could be a warning of a stroke. Arm weakness . Check if one arm is numb or weak. Ask the person to lift both arms and if one arm drifts downward, it is another sign of a possible stroke. Speech problems . Listen for slurred or unusual speech when the affected person tries to repeat a simple sentence. Time to act . If the potentially affected person exhibits even just one of these stroke warning signs, call 911 right away so that the person can be taken care of immediately. There are many other symptoms to look out for, including chronic headaches, involuntary twitching of eyelids or facial muscles, memory lapses and difficulty focusing , numbness in the face or limbs, trembling, unexpected drooling or trouble walking. Tips to lower your stroke risk Taking steps now to reduce your risk can help people lower their chances of experiencing a stroke. Alcohol consumption Refusing to drink any alcohol at all would be the best way to mitigate stroke risk. Those who drink must do so in moderation, or no more than one drink per day. It may also be advisable to drink red wine, as it may offer some protective benefits against heart disease and stroke . Blood pressure control Maintaining healthy blood pressure is crucial for preventing strokes. Aim for a blood pressure reading of less than 120/80, although some individuals may need a slightly higher target. To maintain healthy blood pressure, avoid high-cholesterol foods, consume plenty of fish, fruits, low-fat dairy, vegetables and whole grains, and reduce salt intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams daily. Diabetes management Keeping blood sugar levels under control is vital for stroke prevention. Monitor blood sugar regularly and manage it through diet, exercise and following the advice of health care practitioners. Dietary choices Incorporating certain foods into the diet can significantly lower stroke risk. Garlic, particularly purple and solo varieties, can help clear clogged arteries. Onions, rich in flavonoids, offer anti-inflammatory benefits that reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Shiitake mushrooms contain compounds that protect against artery hardening, while whole grains like brown rice and wheat support heart health by improving blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Corn, a high-fiber food, aids in preventing cardiovascular diseases. Green tea, loaded with catechins, boosts metabolism and offers anti-inflammatory benefits. (Related: Bioactive compounds in GINGKO BILOBA found to improve cognitive recovery after stroke .) Quit smoking Smoking is a major risk factor for stroke. Those that have trouble quitting are advised to seek help, whether through counseling, medication or the use of nicotine replacements. Regular exercise Exercise at moderate intensity several times a week. Simple routines, like breaking workouts into shorter, more numerous sessions or taking the stairs instead of the elevator at work can also make a big difference.

(Article by Danielle republished from 100PercentFedUp.com ) The agency reported 65 illnesses and 24 hospitalizations across nine states. “Milo’s Poultry Farms, LLC. of Bonduel, WI is recalling all ‘Milo’s Poultry Farms’ and ‘Tony’s Fresh Market’ branded eggs because these eggs have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems,” an FDA alert read. “Milo’s Poultry Farms’ eggs were distributed in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan through retail stores and foodservice distributors,” the alert added. SALMONELLA OUTBREAK: 65 people sick in 9 states from eggs labeled with “Milo’s Poultry Farms” or “Tony’s Fresh Market."" Do not eat recalled eggs, throw them away or return them to the store.

All carton sizes of “Tony’s Fresh Market” branded eggs, all expiration dates. All cases of eggs for retail foodservice distribution, all expiration dates. The recall was initiated after the FDA informed the company that environmental samples tested positive for the bacteria. FDA also conducted whole genome sequencing and found that the samples were related to an ongoing Salmonella outbreak investigation. Milo’s Poultry Farms, LLC. has ceased production and distribution at this time and will undergo appropriate testing and sanitization of farms and processing equipment. According to a map posted by the CDC, the states where sick individuals lived include: Wisconsin Illinois Michigan Iowa Minnesota Virginia Colorado Utah California The FDA and CDC are investigating a salmonella outbreak linked to eggs. The eggs are now being recalled in nine states. https://t.co/Clx1yx12ps — Coloradoan (@coloradoan) September 7, 2024 Per USA TODAY : “The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC says. “This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.” The CDC investigation broke down the demographics of the 65 cases reported for the egg recall. People who contracted salmonella ages ranged from two to 88 years old. Fifty-six percent of the cases were females and 46% were male. The race majority for the 65 cases were white which accounted for 92%, followed by 5% African-American or Black and 3% Asian.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-maryland-abortion-clinic-murder-34-weeks-legal.html,Maryland abortion clinic tells caller she can murder unborn child at 34 weeks (8.5 months): “A needle is inserted through the (baby’s) abdomen and into the fetal heart”,"A young lady from Students for Life of America this week called a late-term abortion clinic in Maryland called the CARE Clinic to see whether or not the abortion claims of Kamala Harris at her debate with Donald Trump are true. It turns out that Kamala lied: Unborn babies in Maryland, at least, are being murdered right up to the point of birth. Watch the video below to see for yourself as the abortion clinic confirms the made-up story of the caller about how she is on the verge of giving birth but wants to terminate her baby's life because she is ""in a pretty desperate situation."" ""My boyfriend is kind of out of the picture now so I don't really have any support,"" the caller tells the abortion clinician. ""An abortion at any stage is actually much safer than delivering a term pregnancy,"" the clinician quickly and deceptively responds, affirming to the caller, who says she is 34 weeks, or 8.5 months, along in her pregnancy, that Maryland's CARE Clinics, in this case the location in Bethesda, performs late-term abortions right up to the point of birth. ""It's a four-to-five-day procedure,"" the clinician continued. ""We do some basic lab work on you and start to dilate your cervix. After that, we do what we call the fetal injection. A needle is inserted through the abdomen and into the fetal heart where lidocaine is injected. That will completely numb the fetus so there's no pain."" SHOCK VIDEO: Woman calls clinic in Maryland asking for an ab*rtion at 34 weeks. Clinic AGREES and explains how they stop the baby's heartbeat. This is SICK and once again proves Kamala lied, and ABC ran cover.

The gruesome process of late-term baby murder The gruesome conversation continues from there with the clinician revealing that the next step in the murder process is to ""inject a medication called digoxin and another medication called KCL into the fetal heart which will slow and then stop the fetal heartbeat."" ""And then on the fourth day, depending on how your cervix is dilated, we'll break your water, and then we'll give you a medication called misoprostol. Misoprostol will sort of induce contractions and increase the dilation of your cervix where you're going to have contractions and cramping, and then we'll assist you in sort of pushing in the induction and then remove all of the products of conception."" Notice how instead of calling the baby a baby, even after admitting that the baby can feel the pain of the abortion without drugs, the clinician at the CARE Clinic calls the dead baby ""the products of conception,"" referring to all of the different body parts that are removed and discarded. Because of the extreme pain involved for the woman, the clinician then revealed to the caller that she would be given fentanyl, the most potent and dangerous form of synthetic opioids, during the procedure. ""We specialize in late trimester care,"" the clinician continued, explaining that this is anything other than a rare procedure. ""Our doctor is very well-versed in what he's doing, and he's very good,"" she said, continuing that the facility does late-term abortions like this ""all the time."" Reactions to the call on social media were mixed, but most people seemed to agree that this is a horrific process that should not be allowed. ""Let's be honest,"" one wrote. ""This is legal murder.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-7-types-medications-that-damage-your-kidneys.html,7 Types of medications that can damage your kidneys,"The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located in the abdomen just below your rib cage. They are part of your urinary system and are tasked with filtering your blood, among other things. Your kidneys help clean your blood by removing toxins and waste and secreting them out into your urine . As one of the body's detoxification organs, your kidneys play a major role in processing toxic molecules and chemicals that enter your body, including medications. As such, they are just as susceptible as the liver – the body's main detoxification organ – to damage (nephrotoxicity) caused by drug toxicity. The detoxification process is a series of events that starts in the liver. The liver first breaks down substances present in your blood into their chemical components. While the beneficial ones are returned to circulation to be distributed throughout your body, the harmful molecules/toxins are further broken down by the liver, making them ready for the next stage of processing which happens in the kidneys. (Related: Help your liver detoxify: 4 Tips to remove toxins from the body .) The kidneys work like a sieve, removing waste, other unwanted substances and excess fluid from your blood so they can be flushed out of your body via your urine. Because your kidneys need water to clear out all the harmful chemicals from your bloodstream, sufficient water intake is vital to the success of your body's detoxification process. Your kidneys normally filter your entire blood supply between 20 and 25 times each day. How medications can harm your kidneys Although not discussed as often as it should be, many commonly used medications do in fact harm the kidneys even when taken in small doses or only occasionally. In fact, research suggests that about 20 percent of community- and hospital-acquired cases of acute kidney failure are caused by medications. There are many ways harmful prescriptions can cause kidney injury and impair kidney function. According to research, drug-induced nephrotoxicity occurs through the following mechanisms: Altered intraglomerular hemodynamics - This occurs when medications that affect blood pressure interfere with the activity of the glomerulus – the kidney's filtering unit – and decrease glomerular filtration rate. Under normal conditions and sustained intraglomerular pressure, the glomerulus filters about 120 milliliters (mL) of blood plasma per minute. Tubular cell toxicity - This occurs when medications impair mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress in renal tubular cells. These kidney cells, specifically the proximal tubule cells, are highly exposed to toxic chemicals because they are directly involved in concentrating and reabsorbing glomerular filtrate. Inflammation (glomerulonephritis) - Severe or prolonged inflammation, which can be triggered by oxidative stress or an allergic response to medications, can injure the glomerulus and renal tubular cells, leading to fibrosis and kidney scarring. The scarring process is said to cause loss of nephrons -- kidney structures composed of the glomerulus and renal tubules -- hyperfiltration and progressive decline of kidney function. Crystal nephropathy - Some medications produce crystals that are insoluble in urine. When these crystals precipitate, they can obstruct the flow of urine and cause an interstitial reaction that leads to fibrosis. Crystal nephropathy can impair kidney function or cause kidney failure. Rhabdomyolysis - This syndrome is characterized by the rupturing (lysis) of myocytes, or muscle cells. Certain medications, most notably statins, and commonly abused drugs, have been reported to predispose myocytes to injury, resulting in lysis of myocytes and the release of cellular contents like myoglobin. Myoglobin breaks down into chemicals that can harm the kidneys. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) - A life-threatening complication commonly associated with chemotherapeutic and antiplatelet agents, TMA can damage organs like the kidneys due to the formation of microscopic blood clots in small blood vessels . 7 Categories of prescription medications that can harm your kidneys Despite their intended use, modern pharmaceuticals have the potential to cause more health problems, especially with prolonged or incorrect use. In fact, many commonly prescribed medications are notorious for causing side effects that reduce quality of life for their users. While prescription drugs may help resolve certain issues, this does not change the fact that they are still made of synthetic chemicals that can cause toxicity to healthy cells and organs. Besides the liver, your kidneys are among the most susceptible to the toxic effects of certain medications. Here are seven categories of medications that are known to harm the kidneys: (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com ) Anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen are said to help reduce pain, fever and inflammation by blocking the production of prostaglandins . While the analgesic acetaminophen is thought to work in a similar way, it does not treat inflammation . According to studies, NSAIDs cause kidney injury via altered intraglomerular hemodynamics and glomerulonephritis. Acetaminophen and aspirin are linked to chronic interstitial nephritis, which impairs your kidneys' ability to filter blood and make urine . Blood pressure and heart medications Excessive use of diuretics, which help bring down blood pressure and get rid of extra fluid at the same time, can decrease blood flow to your kidneys, resulting in kidney damage. Meanwhile, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are used to manage hypertension, have been associated with altered intraglomerular hemodynamics. The antiplatelet (anti-blood clot) medications, clopidogrel and ticlopidine, have been found to cause TMA, while statins, which are used to lower blood cholesterol levels, are reported to cause rhabdomyolysis. (Related: Statins are the most prescribed drug with over-hyped benefits and downplayed side effects .) Antibiotics and antifungals Excessive use of antibiotics is linked to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Certain antibiotics are also known to cause kidney damage. For example, aminoglycosides, which are known as broad-spectrum antibiotics, are associated with tubular cell toxicity. Meanwhile, beta-lactams, which include penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins, have been found to cause acute interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis. Quinolones, a type of antibiotics that directly kill bacterial cells, have been reported to cause acute interstitial nephritis and crystal nephropathy. Amphotericin B, which is used to treat serious fungal infections, and pentamidine, an antifungal agent commonly used by HIV patients to prevent a serious type of pneumonia, are also linked to tubular cell toxicity. Antiviral drugs Many antiviral medications are known to cause mitochondrial injury in kidney epithelial cells . Acyclovir, which is used to treat chickenpox, shingles and herpes simplex infections, has been shown to cause acute interstitial nephritis and crystal nephropathy. Foscarnet, an FDA-approved antiviral for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, and ganciclovir, which is used to treat CMV infections of the eyes, have been found to cause crystal nephropathy and tubular cell toxicity. Antiretroviral medications, which are used for the management of HIV/AIDS, are also linked to tubular cell toxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, crystal nephropathy and rhabdomyolysis. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers Antidepressants are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Unfortunately, they are also some of the most harmful prescription drugs to the body, particularly the kidneys. (Related: STUDY: These prescription medications can increase your risk of depression .) Studies show that tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and doxepin, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine can cause rhabdomyolysis. Meanwhile, lithium, a mood stabilizer used for the treatment of depression associated with bipolar disorder , has been found to cause chronic interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis. Chemotherapeutic agents Drugs used in chemotherapy can harm more than just your kidneys because they do not selectively target cancer cells. These toxic chemicals also kill healthy fast-growing cells , such as those in your skin and digestive tract. Chemotherapeutic drugs like carmustine, which is used to treat brain tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cisplatin, which contains platinum, have been linked to chronic interstitial nephritis and tubular cell toxicity. Interferon-alfa, an immunomodulator, is said to cause glomerulonephritis. Methotrexate, an antimetabolite and immunosuppressant, can cause crystal nephropathy. Meanwhile, the antitumor drug mitomycin-C has been shown to cause thrombotic microangiopathy. Contrast agents Contrast agents are dyes used by radiologists to enhance the radiodensity of tissues. These chemicals work by "" altering the way that electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound waves pass through the body."" Contrast agents are known for their toxicity, which could lead to renal insufficiency (poor kidney function) or acute kidney failure. The use of contrast agents in clinical settings has been linked to tubular cell toxicity. The kidneys are important organs that help keep your body healthy by facilitating the removal of toxic substances from your blood. But because of this crucial role, your kidneys are susceptible to drug-induced toxicity. To keep your kidneys and other detoxification organs healthy , opt for natural medicines instead of synthetic drugs and formulations.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-13-plant-based-radiation-protection-tulsi.html,Plant-based radiation protection: Tulsi,"It's a radioactive world Radioactivity is a natural part of our environment and everyone is continually exposed to ionizing radiation from a vast array of natural sources such as the sun and radioactive elements within the earth. However, since Henri Becquerel and Madame Curie first described radioactivity at the turn of last century, humans have continued to concentrate natural radiation sources and use them for medical diagnosis and therapy, food preservation , power generation and the production of nuclear weapons. (Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com ) Concentrated sources of ionizing radiation are relatively new on earth, yet all living systems have had to deal with low levels of radiation. Thus, many plants contain a range of protective phytochemicals and this protection may be conferred to animals that eat them. Perhaps the most potent plants in this regard are the 'adaptogens' such as tulsi ( Ocimum sanctum or holy basil ), which confer protection against a wide range of environmental stressors. Tulsi has been celebrated within Ayurveda for generations as an 'elixir of life', yet it seems likely that the use of tulsi and other adaptogenic herbs will become even more important as the extent of global toxicity becomes apparent. Baby teeth and radiation leaks Over the past half century, humanity's use of radioactive material has led to widespread contamination of our environment. The global spread of radioactivity first came to light in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a citizen science, 'Baby Tooth Survey', collected tens of thousands of baby teeth from around the world. This survey, led by Dr Louise Reiss and scientists from Washington University, revealed that levels of strontium-90 in baby teeth increased more than 50 times after the commencement of nuclear weapons testing. This finding led to the recognition that nuclear material released in one region can be distributed globally and was instrumental in pressuring the US, UK and Russian governments to sign the 1963 treaty banning above-ground nuclear testing. Despite the abolition of above-ground nuclear tests, human-induced radioactive contamination of the earth has continued. The production of radioactive waste from nuclear power generation, use of depleted uranium in armaments and industry, and the unintentional release of radioactive material from accidents at facilities such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, have all contributed to an increase in human radiation exposure. The use of radiation in medicine has also increased sixfold since 1980 [ 1 ] and there is an ever present threat of radiological or nuclear terrorism, or further catastrophic accidents that could place innumerable human lives in peril. Radiation and random cellular events Radioactivity is highly toxic to living tissues and may exacerbate the adverse effects of exposure to other chemical toxins and pre-existing disease. Radiation also has cumulative effects and is of greater risk to children and the unborn fetus, as well as having impacts on reproductive capacity, so that effects can be felt for generations. The adverse effects of radiation are primarily due to the ionization of biological molecules and generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. These chemical species are unstable and damage cells due to uncontrolled reactions with fats, proteins and DNA. While random cellular events induced by radiation are credited with the creation of superheros such as the Hulk and Spiderman, in real life such events are highly damaging to living cells and are more likely to induce cancer than confer superpowers. Tissues that have a high cell turnover such as the skin, gut, blood and immune system are particularly susceptible to radiation-induced cellular damage, which manifest as burns, radiation sickness and cancer, such as the leukemia that killed Madame Curie. Chemical radio-protection While it is impossible to totally avoid exposure to radioactivity, there are chemical agents that can help to cope with, or counter, its effects. The use of radio-protective chemicals has been explored since the 1940s in order to protect against the effects of nuclear weapons and radiological/nuclear terrorism. Radio-protectants are also sought to protect nuclear industry workers and astronauts from radiation exposure, and protect normal tissues from the effects of radiotherapy . Chemical radio-protectants are based on the finding that antioxidants present at the time of irradiation help scavenge free radicals before significant cellular damage occurs. It has also been found that chemical agents given after radiation exposure may assist in DNA repair, reduce inflammation and persistent radiation-induced oxidative stress and facilitate death (apoptosis) of damaged cells. Currently, amifostine is the only approved radio-protectant drug and this is rarely used due to significant side effects. There are however, many natural compounds with radio-protective activity. Such compounds include sulfhydryl-containing compounds and anti-oxidant nutrients such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, N-acetyl cysteine and selenium, along with a range of phytochemicals found in plants such as Ginkgo biloba , Vitis vinifera (grape seed), Camellia sinensis (tea), Curcuma longa ( turmeric ), and Ocimum sanctum (tulsi or holy basil) [ 2 ]. Tulsi – general adaptogen and radio-protector Of the plants with radio-protective properties, tulsi is the most studied. Considered the most potent adaptogen within Ayurvedic medicine, tulsi is revered within India as being without equal for its medicinal and spiritual properties. Tulsi is also known to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and is recommended to be taken regularly to help the body adapt to a variety of stressors. Various laboratory and animal studies have found that tulsi's radio-protective effects include reducing the oxidative and chromosomal damage induced by gamma radiation and radioactive iodine [ 3-10 ]. This has led to research to develop radio-protective medicines from tulsi and phase II human trials are currently underway at the Defense Research and Development Organization in India [ 11 ]. The radio-protective effects of tulsi are, at least partly, attributed to its content of the water-soluble flavonoids, orientin and vicenin. Low doses of these flavonoids have been shown to protect against radiation-induced cellular damage in animal and human cells through increased anti-oxidant enzymes activity and free radical scavenging and reduced lipid peroxidation [ 4 , 12-16 ]. The finding that water-based tulsi extracts enhance survival of mice exposed to whole-body gamma radiation and are more radio-protective than alcoholic extracts [ 17 ], suggests that the radio-protective properties of tulsi are available when tulsi is taken as a tea. Regular consumption of tulsi tea may therefore increase resistance to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation, in addition to being recommended as a good strategy to promote longevity and enhance physical and mental health. Exposure metrics Knowing your radiation exposure can be difficult because radiation is invisible and exposure is cumulative and may occur through multiple routes including ingestion, inhalation, absorption and injection. There are also many uncertainties in estimating human exposure globally and despite more than 50 years passing since the Baby Tooth Survey held governments to account, there are currently no programs to monitor global human exposure to radiation. In light of many recent and ongoing world events, there is a growing need for a coordinated effort to monitor global toxicity due to radioactive contamination and other industrial wastes. The need for human biomonitoring may be realized through the power of the internet and the emergence of innovative personal devices such as the airqualityegg.com and mylapka.com that provide ongoing measures of human exposures. We may therefore be at the brink of a new era of citizen science where open-source, peer-2-peer platforms such as habitatmap.org allow citizens from around the world to collaborate on mapping global toxicity. Such initiatives may also serve to engage the world's brightest minds in developing measures aimed at mitigation and remediation measures. In the meantime, we must all accept that the world is increasingly contaminated and try to take steps to limit our exposure and ensure our body's cellular defenses are well supported. This involves adopting healthy and sustainable lifestyle practices that include daily consumption of herbs such as tulsi and phytochemically rich plants to provide our cells with an ongoing supply of radio-protective phytonutrients. While it is important to try to reduce exposure to environmental toxins, it may be just as important to reduce toxic stress. Therefore, any toxin reduction strategy should include not getting too caught up in Armageddon scenarios and focusing on positive attitudes and actions that will mitigate the effects of toxic mental and environmental stress rather than exacerbate them.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-massie-recorded-calls-cdc-lied-covid-vaccines.html,Rep. Thomas Massie says recorded phone calls prove CDC lied about COVID “vaccine” efficacy,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lied to Americans about the efficacy of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" unleashed through Operation Warp Speed, and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has proof . Rep. Massie caught the CDC lying in its official publication (MMWR) about COVID jab efficacy all the way back in December 2020. He further confirmed the lies by calling the CDC and recording the answers he received to questions about the shots. When the CDC refused to tell the general public the truth, Rep. Massie took it upon himself to share the recordings with investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson who exposed them publicly. ""The CDC, in a paper that had to be written by the vaccine makers in my mind, lied about what the studies found, which encouraged people who probably already had immunity because they already had COVID, to go out and get a vaccine that could give them side effects,"" Attkisson explains in the video below. ""So they created or worsened what could be considered a crisis by their misinformation ... And my big question is, the misinformation was signed off on by something like twelve members of this CDC expert committee. Did none of them read the original studies as I had and as Congressman Massie had? Do they just sign papers somebody else writes and not understand the data and the claims in it are wrong? I think this is a huge scandal and nobody's been held to account for that."" ? Sharyl Attkisson on How Rep.

""I hope a Trump administration will provide more transparency and open debate so that trust can be rebuilt,"" someone wrote on X in hopeful anticipation of some soon changes. Another X user added to Rep. Massie's claims by stating that he caught the government hiding vaccine deaths from the public by deleting what is known as Y59.0 from death records.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-autism-covid-jabs-destruction-of-good-gut-bacteria.html,The CONNECTION between AUTISM and COVID JABS could boil down to destruction of good gut bacteria,"There is no question that gut microbiota influences neurological disorders such as autism, where normal brain development is affected. This is well-documented, as most autistic people suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms . Many comprehensive and in-depth studies of the gut microbiome-brain axis help researchers and those privy to that research understand the mechanism that leads to the onset of neurological dysfunctions and disorders and may be the key to finding treatments for autism. Big Pharma and the Vaccine Industrial Complex (VIC) do not want anyone studying this, reading about it, or talking about it. Autism is one of the biggest cash cows for the VIC, and now it’s come to light that the Covid-19 mRNA jabs are contributing to the further spike in autism cases. Surprised? Big Pharma’s cash cow autism now “injected” with new major cause ­– Fauci Flu mRNA “vaccines” One of the most insidious ways Big Pharma bankrolls off human health detriment is via vaccines, and now there’s a new secret biological weapon for bankrolling off kids during their developmental years. Realize that babies are not born with autism . This should be parents' first red flag that something external is influencing the child’s inability to experience normal brain development, good communication skills, proper reasoning abilities and typical behavioral patterns from about 2 years of age through elementary school. Medical doctors are either puzzled by the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) “pandemic” or they know the main culprit and simply can’t talk about it, and don’t know how to “fix it” or at least minimize future damage (tell parents to stop administering most vaccines to the child). Families spend a fortune on doctors who try to alleviate autistic conditions with drugs, including antidepressants which are quite dangerous and interfere with serotonin uptake (SSRIs). Now research is revealing that the Covid “clot shots” that trick human cells into creating billions of microscopic virus-mimicking prions are contributing to the autism nightmare. Pile this onto all the other dirty vaccines infants and toddlers get injected with during their developmental years, and you’ve got a compounded, persistent issue with the biological seat of immunity – the gut. Now the CDC has ADDED the deadly, autism-causing Covid stabs to the recommended childhood vaccine schedule. It’s just medical insanity, and more profits for Big Pharma from their autism and vaccine cash cows. Clot shots are a cash cow for the Big Pharma autism scamdemic, driving ASD rates even higher over the past 3 years than they already were According to the CDC, the average lifetime cost for an individual with autism is around $1.4 million. For U.S. cases identified over the past three decades, families have spent over $7 trillion. Think about that for a minute. Here's how the Covid jabs are contributing to the autism rates. The spike proteins travel throughout the vascular system to the entire body, including the gut, destroying beneficial gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium infantis , that convert tryptophan into serotonin, regulating behavior and emotions. This is also destroying the proper production of antioxidants and neuro-protectant molecules in the gut. See what’s happening? The child’s immune system then believes that the gut is being invading by foreign intruders and pathogenic microbes (because it is, even though its own cells are creating them), and attacks them, leading to auto-immune disorders also. It gets worse. Then the infant or toddler’s gut is susceptible to being invaded by various pathogens, leading to the development of GI issues from the presence of bacteria called Clostridium bolteae ( Tsai et al., 2012 ; Rosenfeld, 2015 ). This would indicate a much higher risk and severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder, as this bacteria produces a neurotoxin (TeNT) that passes through the Vagus nerve to the central nervous system and blocks neurotransmitters in the brain. And that’s the low-down on clot shots and why all parents should question the safety of all vaccines, especially the mRNA “gene therapy” injections.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-moderna-admits-covid-vaccine-injections-cause-cancer.html,Moderna admits in patent filings that its mRNA COVID-19 injections can cause CANCER,"Cambridge, Massachusetts-based vaccine maker Moderna has confirmed that its mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections could cause cancer . The company made this admission in patent filings disclosed by Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, during a hearing led by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna's patent shows that its vaccine contains billions of DNA fragments and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer. The expert also mentioned that Moderna's patent acknowledges that RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines. However, the vaccine maker also acknowledges the contamination risk involved with its COVID-19 vaccine that was injected into the arms of millions. Malone testified: ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines. And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes [despite] problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. ""[The Food and Drug Administration ] FDA says they're not aware of any concerns. But Moderna, in its own patent, lays out exactly the same concerns that exist about DNA. So Moderna knows it – DNA is a contaminant . ""It is left in because of the way they make it. They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA. [Afterward,] they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA – and the process they are using is not that good."" According to the Daily Expose , scientists from the U.S. and Canada managed to procure unopened vials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with a clear chain of custody. They proceeded to take samples from these and examine them, discovering large numbers of DNA fragments in the RNA preparation. The scientists then applied standard reconstruction tools to see what the circular plasmid DNAs looked like. According to Malone, the findings suggest the presence of certain DNA sequences in the vials normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans – ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene."" Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine also loaded with cancer-causing CONTAMINANTS ""They include these sequences from Simian Virus 40 (SV40) – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences. [This] is exactly the thing that the FDA, in their older regulations, said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis,"" the mRNA vaccine technology inventor noted. But the problem isn't just present in Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 injection. Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, produced in cooperation with German company BioNTech, also contained the same contaminants. The New York-based Pfizer provided documentation about its COVID-19 injection to regulators in the U.S., Europe and Canada. However, the regulators deleted the little notation about SV40 sequences Pfizer wrote in filings – apparently in an attempt to hide it from the public. ""The FDA didn't take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps, and look at them themselves,"" Malone clarified. ""They just took for granted what Pfizer had given them. And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found."" (Related: Health Canada confirms that Pfizer COVID-19 injections contain SV40 DNA sequence that can cause CANCER. ) According to Malone, high-level people at both Moderna and Pfizer had to have known the dangers their COVID-19 vaccines pose to the world. The potential consequences for those injected with the poison shot include ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-canada-orders-clinics-destroy-pfizer-moderna-vaccines.html,"DESTROYING EVIDENCE: Canada orders vaccine clinics to destroy Pfizer, Moderna mRNA vaccine vials","The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has ordered provinces to destroy Pfizer and Moderna Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine vials provided last season to ""make way for updated shots"" that the federal regulator has yet to approve. Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta public health officials said they removed doses targeting the old omicron XBB variant. Provinces that ordered the jabs withdrawn as of Aug. 31 or Sept. 1 said they did so at the behest of PHAC. The new vaccines that are a closer match for the current variants are expected to be rolled out in late September or early October. Canada is reportedly in the middle of a late-summer wave of COVID-19, driven by waning immunity and a variant called KP.3.1.1, which accounted for an alleged estimated 62.2 percent of variants in Canada as of Aug. 25. In Ontario, Chief Medical Officer of Health Kieran Moore issued a memo on Aug. 27 saying that the PHAC ordered a market withdrawal of all doses targeting the XBB variant effective Sept. 1. Julie Kryzanowski, Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical health officer, issued a memo similar to Ontario's on Aug. 28. Dale Hunter, a spokesman for that province's Health Ministry, confirmed that ""all health care facilities, pharmacies and physician offices in Saskatchewan"" disposed of their remaining XBB shots on Aug. 31. In Quebec, the health ministry said some vaccine appointments would have to be canceled as a result of PHAC's withdrawal order but Quebec anticipates the access gap will last as little as two weeks. Meanwhile, the Manitoba government said it asked vaccine providers to return unused XBB doses to the province as of the end of August. ""Specific requests for patients that may still need a dose of the current vaccine within a short time frame can still be considered on a case-by-case basis,"" the province said in an unattributed email.

Oncologist: Do not destroy potential evidence of vaccines' ineffectiveness and inefficacy Meanwhile, oncologist and top cancer researcher Dr. William Makis discouraged authorities from throwing away the vaccine vials , as these may serve as future evidence of the vaccines' ineffectiveness and inefficacy. ""You may be wondering if one day you will be held accountable for injecting a toxic pharmaceutical product that you knew or should have known into people who were injured or have died suddenly, for injecting it into children and pregnant women, you were just following orders, just wanted a job,"" he said.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-early-warning-signs-of-kidney-disease.html,11 Early warning signs of kidney disease,"Your kidneys play a vital role in keeping your body healthy but the signs of trouble are often subtle and easy to miss – until it's too late. Kidney disease is a silent threat, creeping up unnoticed until it reaches a critical stage. However, catching it early can make all the difference. By recognizing the early warning signs and making lifestyle changes, you can protect your kidneys and potentially save your life. (Related: Cleaning the cleaners: Herbs that help maintain healthy kidneys .) Some of the early warning signs are easy to spot, such as your skin becoming sallow or taking on a more yellowish complexion, your lips darkening, your tongue turning a deep red shade with a bluish tint and thick wide coating, a strong odor of urine coming from your body and full-body swelling. Paying attention to what your body is telling you could help you catch kidney issues early before they become more serious problems down the line. Here are some of the other signs of kidney disease. Ammonia-like breath Ammonia-like odor on your breath could be a sign that your kidneys are not filtering waste effectively. When kidney function declines, waste products, including urea, can build up in the blood. Urea breaks down to form ammonia, which can cause your breath to have a distinctive, unpleasant odor. This symptom often appears as kidney function deteriorates. Blood in your urine Seeing blood in your urine is a serious signal or red flag that something might be wrong. Normally, your kidneys keep blood cells in the body when filtering out waste, but when their filters are damaged, blood cells can leak into the urine. Blood in the urine can be linked to kidney disease, as well as infections, kidney stones or tumors. Cold intolerance If you're feeling unusually cold all the time, it could be related to kidney disease. Reduced kidney function can lead to anemia, which decreases your body's ability to regulate temperature. Anemia, along with the overall metabolic changes that occur with kidney disease, can make you more sensitive to cold temperatures. Dry, itchy skin Your kidneys do more than filter waste – they also help regulate and maintain the balance of minerals and nutrients in your body, keep your bones strong and produce red blood cells. When kidney function is compromised and declines, your skin might start feeling dry and itchy due to imbalances in minerals and nutrients. This could be an early warning of bone and mineral disorders associated with kidney disease. Feeling more tired or foggy If you're feeling unusually tired, low on energy or struggling to concentrate, it might be more than just a rough day, days or week. As your kidneys lose their ability to filter waste from your blood, toxins and waste products can build up – making you feel exhausted and mentally foggy. Kidney-related anemia is another factor that can contribute to this overwhelming sense of fatigue or general body malaise. Muscle cramps Frequent muscle cramps could be linked to kidney issues. Imbalances in electrolytes, such as calcium and phosphorus, which are managed by your kidneys, can lead to cramping, great discomfort and pain. Puffy or swollen eyes Waking up with puffy eyes that don't seem to go away could be an early indication of kidney trouble. This puffiness can result from your kidneys leading protein into your urine – resulting to fluid retention around your eyes. Reduced appetite Losing interest in food can be caused by many things, but it is also a symptom of declining kidney function. As waste builds up in your body due to poor kidney filtration, you may find that you simply don't feel like eating. Restless leg syndrome Characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move your legs, restless leg syndrome (RLS) is often accompanied by uncontrollable sensations. It is commonly associated with kidney disease due to the buildup of toxins in the blood, which can affect nerve function. RLS can disrupt your sleep and significantly impact quality of life – making it another important symptom to be aware of. Struggling to sleep Trouble falling or staying asleep might be a sign that your kidneys are not doing their job. When they are not filtering properly, toxins and waste products remain in your bloodstream, which can disrupt your sleep. There is also a connection between kidney disease and sleep disorders like sleep apnea – especially in people who are overweight . Swollen ankles and feet If your ankles and feet are swelling up, it could be due to sodium retention from reduced kidney function. While this symptom can also be related to heart or liver issues or problems with leg veins, it is a common sign of kidney dysfunction. By recognizing these early signs, you can take proactive steps to protect your kidney health . If any of these symptoms resonate with you, it is important to seek professional medical advice and address potential kidney issues before they progress. Taking care of your kidneys is essential for overall health and it can be as simple as staying active and fit , avoiding smoking, eating a balanced diet and regularly consulting with your trusted health care practitioner.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-wef-admits-covid-test-obedience-globalism.html,WEF admits COVID was a “test” of public obedience to new globalist world order,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has quietly revealed that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic"" was a ""test"" hatched by the globalists to see how compliant and obedient the public is to globalist tyranny. On the ""My Carbon"" page of its website, the WEF makes a pitch for 15-minute ""smart"" cities as the solution to climate change. On that page, the WEF shows its hand about what COVID was really designed to do. ""COVID-19 was the test of society responsibility,"" the WEF openly admits. ""A huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were adopted by billions of citizens across the world."" ""There were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility."" In other words, the WEF was testing us all to see how we would respond to ridiculously pseudoscientific measures like avoiding other people and covering one's breathing holes with cloth and plastic. This ""new normal,"" as they called it, was meant to ease the world into a more permanent state of restricted living. ""They wanted to see how many of us would give up our individual freedom and individual sovereignty by complying with a 'new normal' that consisted of restrictions bordering on the absurd,"" Leo Hohmann writes on his Substack. ""Why, for instance was it 'safe' to shop at Lowe's or Home Depot but unsafe to shop at a small business or attend church? Why was it OK to go to strip clubs in Michigan but you couldn't buy seeds for a garden?"" (Related: Once the government's central bank digital currency [CBDC] is in place, it will be much easier for the deep state to control people during the next ""pandemic."") ""Sustainability"" is about forced obedience to tyranny When they first started using the term ""sustainability"" to describe a future free from excess waste and planetary destruction, the globalists had hoped that most people would simply buy in based on the name. Many people now realize, though, that sustainability is simply a code word for forced compliance with tyranny. In the ""sustainable"" world of the future, Americans will no longer have the constitutionally protected freedom to speak up and question anything. The expectation will be that everyone complies at all times with the government's orders without asking any questions, which is what we saw transpire during COVID. ""Would we be obedient in the face of idiotic new laws and regulations, like wearing face diapers to stop what was said to be an aerosolized virus, and standing six feet apart in public, and submitting to a never-before-used, unlicensed mRNA gene-based injection?"" Hohmann asks. ""They said it was good for you, so roll up your sleeve. Don't ask questions. If you did, you could lose your job and be treated as a societal outcast. Many people lost friends or even close family members to this monstrous 'test' of our willingness to unquestioningly do what we're told."" It has been nearly five years since COVID first appeared, and the WEF is finally fessing up to what many of us could see was the case all along: that COVID was simply an exercise in tyranny designed to traumatize the public and break down any remaining public willpower to fight back against the authoritarian police state. ""They wanted to find out how many of us would prove our servitude to the lawless, fascistic beast system by complying with 'unimaginable restrictions,' many of which were created out of thin air with absolutely no scientific evidence to back them up as contributing anything to public health,"" Hohmann says.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-therapy-logs-video-sessions-leaked-open-web.html,"Therapy logs, video sessions for 1.7 million American mental patients LEAKED to open web after data breach","Austin-based healthcare startup Confidant Health is in the news after an estimated 5.3 terabytes worth of the company's mental health data was leaked to the open web. More than 1.7 million activity logs including psychological profiles and therapy sessions for thousands of patients, including ""telehealth"" audio and video files, were included in the leak, as were patient driver's licenses. Since first getting off the ground in 2018, Confidant has been promising to build ""the next-generation of virtual care"" for mental health patients seeking treatment for addictions and behavioral problems. Instead, Confidant botched the security of its confidential patient files by storing them in a ""non-password-protected database."" Confidant currently offers clinical services to patients in Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, Virginia and Texas. The Confidant Health app is available on both the iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) platforms, having been downloaded some 10,000 times in the Google Play Store. (Related: Did you know that ""nearly all"" AT&T customers were hacked in a data breach earlier this summer?) People's deepest, darkest secrets shared with the world Cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler is credited with discovering the leak. He commented that the patient audio and video files contain ""some heartbreaking, really painful family trauma, personal trauma."" ""It's almost like having your deepest, darkest secrets that you've told your diary revealed,"" he added. ""It's things that you never want to get out."" As a show of respect for professional ethics, Fowler chose not to download any of the private medical information. He also did not attempt to access the password-protected databases, though he did say that a dedicated hacker could easily break in if he or she was so inclined. ""Cyber criminals have a range of tools at their disposal including brute force attacks and social engineering attempts that could potentially result in unauthorized access to those protected files and documents,"" Fowler further said. What Fowler did observe as part of his investigation was a trove of publicly visible patient documents that are clearly labeled as things like psychotherapy intake notes and professional assessments on individual patient health. There are also documents outlining patient histories of mental health, substance abuse, family issues, psychiatric history and other problems. There were also many other files included in the leak such as administrative documents and verification records, i.e., state-issued identification and insurance cards. Other files include drug tests, some with Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that show positive results for substances like cannabis and alcohol. Much of the leaked data had been collected by Confidant's proprietary chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI), meaning robots rather than humans were in charge of it. Confidant has long bragged about its advanced chatbots and AI programs, which the company claims are pros rather than cons. ""A data-centric environment like the one we are constructing lends itself to leveraging AI to make predictive suggestions,"" said Confidant's co-founder Sam Arsenault Wilson in a 2022 interview. ""That's where we're headed once the data reaches proper scale."" In a report he compiled for the security website vpnMentor, Fowler noted that in a random sampling of data he reviewed, the open and publicly accessible files ""contained what could be considered a very serious potential risk to the personal privacy and PII of those individuals."" Of the approximately 1,000 files he personally reviewed to better understand how the data breach occurred in the first place, Fowler revealed that he ""was able to view using only a web browser,"" meaning anyone can access the leaked files without any understanding of hacking. Fowler made note of the fact that maintaining an exposed database of documents without password protection like Confidant has been doing is highly unusual, especially in the healthcare industry.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-cambridge-university-children-15-statins-heart-attack.html,Cambridge University says children as young as 15 should take statins to reduce heart attack risk,"Researchers at the University of Cambridge have released a new study claiming that children as young as 15 should take statin drugs to reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke. With so many young people developing heart issues due to Operation Warp Speed, medical experts are apparently scrambling for solutions, even going so far as to push dangerous heart medications on young people. (Related: Did you know that statin drugs are actually mitochondrial toxins that cause heart disease rather than prevent it?) According to the research team, high or fluctuating cholesterol in childhood can lead to a condition of the heart called atherosclerosis. Fatty deposits build up over time in the arterial system causing blockages in the blood supply, which in turn can lead to fatal heart attacks and strokes. Lead author Prof. Ziad Mallat, a cardiologist, says minor children should start taking statin drugs for cholesterol if ""lifestyle measures have failed."" For their paper , Mallat and his team fed two groups of rodents a fat-rich diet full of ""bad"" cholesterol. The rats ate the high-fat food either intermittently or continuously. ""When I asked my group and a number of people who are experts in atherosclerosis, no one could tell me what the result would be,"" Mallat, a British Heart Foundation (BHF) expert in cardiovascular medicine, said. ""Some people thought it would make no difference. Others thought it would change the risk."" ""In fact, what we found was that an intermittent high fat diet starting while the mice were still young – one week on, a few weeks off, another week on, and so on – was the worst option in terms of atherosclerosis risk."" High cholesterol in childhood linked to clogged arteries as an adult Fluctuating cholesterol levels are dangerous because the constant change can damage protective immune cells known as resident arterial macrophages. When these macrophages become damaged, the early stages of atherosclerosis often manifest. Intermittently high cholesterol can prevent resident arterial macrophages from becoming protective like they are supposed to and instead accelerate the development of atherosclerosis. For the people portion of their research, Mallat and his colleagues looked at 2,000 people between the ages of three and 12 who were first recruited to participate in heart research back in the 1980s. Currently, these people are between 30 and 50 years old. All of the participants had ultrasounds on their carotid arteries as adults. Those who showed high cholesterol levels as children were more likely today to have the largest build-up of plaque in their arteries. ""What this means is that we shouldn't leave it until later in life before we start to look at our cholesterol levels,"" Mallat said. ""Atherosclerosis can potentially be prevented by lowering cholesterol levels, but we clearly need to start thinking about this much earlier on in life than we previously thought."" In speaking to the media about his findings, Mallat said that increased awareness about the risks is needed, followed by ""screening"" programs that look for artery blockages earlier in life so more children can be prescribed statins . ""Our studies suggest that we should think about increasing public awareness of the detrimental impact of high cholesterol levels even early in life,"" Mallat added. ""Increasing awareness is the first step, then this could be followed later by putting in place 'screening' programs at a much earlier age than it is currently done."" Mallat believes that the age range of 15-18 is a good time for children to start getting screened for heart problems as this is a ""sensitive"" time in a person's life.

Kennedy Jr. dropped a bomb about the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), calling it ""a criminal organization."" Before interviewer Calley Means could even get done explaining the corruption behind the AAP, Kennedy interjected that the organization is untrustworthy and not worth the advice it dispenses. ""That is a criminal organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, because doctors actually believe them,"" Kennedy shot back after Means revealed that the AAP wants the injectable weight-loss drug Ozempic, rather than proper diet, to be the first line of defense for 12-year-old children. ""So they're extremely dangerous,"" Kennedy continued. ""And the doctors don't know that they just work for the pharmaceutical companies and they work for the food industry."" ? Robert F. Kennedy Jr & Calley Means Expose the American Academy of Pediatrics RFK JR: “That is a criminal organization…Doctors don’t know that they just work for the pharmaceutical companies and they work for the food industry.” CALLEY: “The AAP actually did partnerships… pic.twitter.com/nZfstL5ujo — Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) September 7, 2024 (Related: Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are planning to end the globalist war on America's small farms in order to save the nation's food supply.) AAP maintains partnerships with Coca-Cola, other junk food companies Means responded in agreement to Kennedy's statements about the AAP. A former industry consultant himself, Means recalled seeing AAP corruption way back when during the early days of his tenure. ""It's a huge problem,"" Means explained. ""I'll take it to when I was an early career consultant for the food and pharma industries. The AAP actually did partnerships with Coke."" According to Means, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) also took millions of dollars from Coke. ""I helped funnel it,"" Means admitted about the role he personally played in facilitating cash transfers between the ADA and the junk food industry. ""Diabetes, which is literally caused by the weapon of mass destruction for blood sugar issues: liquid sugar, they didn't denounce Coke – they took money from them."" If the AAP and the ADA did not have statutory authority to act as government agents, their direct ties to Big Pharma and Big Food would not be nearly the threat they are. It is precisely because these groups hold so much power over what Americans eat and what kind of medical care is offered that the threat is more real than many imagine it to be. ""The problem is they have statutory authority in the United States, quasi-governmental authority, to make the standard of care,"" Means warns. ""So, if you're a doctor and you go against the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, you could lose your license. If you go against the American Diabetes Association, you could lose your license."" In 2018, the ADA did not even have any dietary guidelines at all. Its advice was simply to take pharmaceutical medications and eat whatever you want, which is terrible advice for diabetics. ""These groups fundamentally are organisms of pharma, which are fundamentally incentivized for more people to get diabetes, for more people to get heart disease, for more people to get obese, for more kids to get sick – that's just a raw economic fact."" In essence, the AAP and the ADA are advising the general public to do the wrong things for their health. And this is on purpose because a sick population is a profitable population from the perspective of the pharmaceutical and processed food industries.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-gain-of-function-viruses-funded-us-taxpayer-money.html,"GAIN OF FUNCTION research on viruses from bats, birds and monkeys funded with U.S. taxpayer money and nefariously created in Chinese Communist Party labs","As an American, one should expect that taxpayer money goes directly to helping this country and its citizens prosper, including top-notch public education; fully functional roads, tunnels and bridges; and a strong military in all aspects, among other services. Without feeling like a conspiracy theorist, nobody should have to question whether our taxpayer money might be used to outright harm Americans, and what’s worse, in ways that we would all, on the surface, believe are helping us. That’s where the White Coat Waste Project comes into play, with a recent investigation that exposed how the USDA collaborates with the Chinese Communist Party and their Academy of Sciences to fund and create gain-of-function viruses to make viruses that normally only infect animals now infect humans. Sounds insane, right? 18 Members of Congress now demanding answers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding millions of dollars spent creating new deadly viruses Who are the creators of these new viruses intending to kill? What other purpose could there possibly be for scientists to be creating “novel” viruses that leap from animals to humans and create pandemics? It’s obviously to create more biological weapons of mass destruction, going against the Geneva Convention and every ethical and moral obligation that modern medicine could violate. The letter from Congressional members to USDA boss Tom Vilsack reads, “We are disturbed by recent reports about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on bird flu research. This research, funded by American taxpayers, could potentially generate dangerous new lab-created virus strains that threaten our national security and public health.” It’s a fact that Covid-19 gain of function virus was made in the Wuhan lab using U.S. taxpayer funds that Anthony “Insidious” Fauci directed to them by the millions. That man should be in prison for life without parole for mass murder, but instead, new research is being funded to make MORE deadly viruses that can leap from bats, birds and monkeys to humans so we can all experience more plandemics soon. The White Coat Waste Project used the Freedom of Information Act to uncover USDA documents revealing this latest Bird Flu collusion between the U.S. and Communist China. Previously, under oath, the Secretary of Agriculture swore that the U.S. was NOT colluding with the CCP to make Bird Flu have gain of function ability, saying “It’s really not a collaboration per se… To my knowledge there is not [data] sharing...all of this is basically walled off, so everything we’re doing stays with us, it doesn’t necessarily go to the UK or to China.” Never forget, the original story of the origins of Covid-19 was that some Chinamen were eating some bat soup that was infected or contaminated, and they somehow got infected themselves. You can’t make this stuff up (well, they did). Now, the U.S. is funneling millions to CCP labs to make new pandemic-style viruses they can “accidentally” release or claim terrorists stole from their labs and released. Either way, it wouldn’t happen, nor have happened, if these scientists weren’t being handed millions in grant money to work on it all. Period. On one of the USDA documents exposed through the FOIA requests, written on official USDA letterhead, a USDA microbiologist said the U.S. is engaged in a “tri-country” partnership with the UK and China to study “transmission dynamics of newly emerging avian influenza viruses.” Sounds quite nefarious.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-republican-governors-will-not-comply-pandemic-treaty.html,26 Republican governors tell WHO they will not comply with Pandemic Treaty,"Twenty-six governors in the United States have publicly declared their opposition to the World Health Organization's (WHO) attempt at controlling the public health policies of America through its global Pandemic Treaty . ""The World Health Organization is attempting one world control over health policy with their new 'Pandemic Agreement.' Twenty-four Republican governors expressed concern over this development in a joint letter in May. Put simply, Republican governors will not comply ,"" the 26 governors, who are all Republicans, and the Republican Governors Association said in their joint statement released on August 29. (Related: Dr. Meryl Nass warns: WHO pandemic treaty is about global dominion by the few and total control of the masses .) In a May 22 letter to President Joe Biden , 24 Republican governors stated their concerns about the WHO's proposal. As stated in the letter, the WHO's proposed treaty would ""empower the WHO, particularly its uncontrollable director-general, with the authority to restrict the rights of U.S. citizens, including freedoms such as speech, privacy, travel, choice of medical care and informed consent, thus violating our Constitution's core principles."" Over the past two years, the WHO has been attempting to pass the Pandemic Treaty. In December 2021, the World Health Assembly established an intergovernmental negotiating body to create an international document under the WHO constitution to strengthen the agency's pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The U.S. federal government has backed the initiative with the Biden administration participating in negotiations with the World Health Assembly as one of the intergovernmental negotiating bodies. The WHO issued a second draft of the Pandemic Treaty in October 2023. Even though WHO negotiators disagreed on a final draft of the agreement during the latest World Health Assembly session, they did approve a set of amendments to the WHO's International Health Regulations. American states' actions ""central"" to defeating WHO's Pandemic Treaty push Dr. Meryl Nass, in an interview with The Defender , stated that the action taken by American states was ""central"" to defeating the WHO plan to centralize control of public health during declared emergencies. ""Children's Health Defense and Door to Freedom were central in devising this strategy. The Constitution's 10th Amendment reserves for the states all powers that were not specifically granted to the central government. Healthcare was never a federal authority,"" Nass said. ""Therefore, we urged citizens to contact their attorneys general, governors, legislators – and federal officials – to demand they not turn over authority for health to the WHO."" In May, in addition to 24 governors writing their letter of opposition, 49 senators called on the Biden administration to reject the WHO agreement. Moreover, 22 attorneys general informed Biden they would ""resist any attempt to enable the WHO to directly or indirectly set public policy for our citizens."" Several American states which include Utah, Florida, Louisiana and Oklahoma wrote a bill to prevent the WHO from overriding states' authority on matters of public health policy. ""I am certain that these efforts reverberated around the world and helped lead to rejection,"" Nass stated of the WHO's proposals.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-cdc-wants-inject-babies-with-covid-vaccines.html,CDC wants to inject BABIES with COVID-19 shots – but they aren’t licensed for kids under 12,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wants babies to get doses of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. However, no COVID-19 vaccine is licensed for children under the age of 12. According to the public health agency's guidance issued on Aug. 30, children as young as six months old should get injected with either two doses of the 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or three doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. For the latest Moderna injection, the CDC recommends that babies get the first dose at six months and the second dose a month after the first. For the latest Pfizer shot, the agency advises that the first dose should be given at six months. The second dose should be given three weeks after the first, and the third dose should be given at least eight weeks after the second. Following the CDC's guidance, nine-month-old babies must have been injected with the COVID-19 vaccine to be considered ""up to date"" with their vaccination. But the problem is that both the latest versions of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are not licensed for use on children under 12. This is because the Food and Drug Administration only granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the new vaccines. Children's Health Defense (CHD) CEO Mary Holland remarked that the CDC is ""absolutely misleading"" the public by asserting that COVID-19 vaccines granted EUA are safe and effective. This is because EUA vaccines are not held to the same safety or efficacy standards as licensed vaccines. ""By law, EUA products 'may be effective' and they have not undergone the safety testing required to permit licensing. This is one more horrific example of the CDC putting profits before people and acting as an unethical arm of Big Pharma's marketing operation,"" she said. ""The earlier COVID-19 shots have been proven unsafe and ineffective. Now we're asked to believe that newer versions are miraculously safe and effective?"" CDC still defends COVID-19 vaccines as ""safe and effective"" According to the CDC, ""the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known risks of COVID-19 and possible severe complications."" But Brian Hooker, CHD's chief scientific officer, begged to differ. He pointed to research showing the dangers of vaccine induced myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and pericarditis (heart lining inflammation). ""It is criminal that these untested vaccines are being recommended to infants and children, especially given the fraudulent tactics to market them to an unsuspecting public,"" Hooker said. He stressed that there are still no licensed COVID-19 vaccines available for children under 12, so all COVID-19 injections given to young children are EUA products. The Defender explained that if a parent takes her children to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine, her 12-year old could receive the fully licensed one. Meanwhile, her 11-year-old must get injected with the unlicensed COVID-19 vaccines available only under EUA. Hooker described the CDC's actions as problematic given that historically, regulatory authorities have interpreted the meaning of ""safe"" as the benefits outweighing the risks. He continued: ""With the risk to children of dying from a COVID-19 infection being statistically zero, it is unclear if there is any benefit."" Holland ultimately concluded that the CDC's new guidance is an insult to people’s intelligence. ""I pray that parents will have the good sense to say no to these dangerous and unnecessary shots for babies,"" she said.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-alberta-bill-protect-health-care-workers-euthanasia.html,Alberta proposing bill to protect health care workers from being compelled to euthanize patients,"Alberta is gearing up to introduce a new piece of legislation that promises to protect the rights of health care workers and hospices when it comes to euthanasia and assisted suicide. The proposed ""Alberta Bill of Rights"" seeks to ensure that medical professionals and facilities have the freedom to opt out of providing these services based on personal conscience. A draft of the proposed legislation has revealed a key section dedicated to safeguarding health care workers from being mandated to participate in the nationwide euthanasia program known as Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD). This section is part of a broader emphasis on ""freedom of informed consent and the right to make personal decisions,"" which also includes the right to refuse vaccinations and other medical procedures. The draft states: ""Health care professionals and private hospice facilities have the right to freedom of conscience when deciding whether to recommend or participate in providing medical assistance in dying."" This language clearly separates the responsibilities of health care providers from those of end-of-life care – reinforcing the principle that medical care should focus on healing rather than hastening death. (Related: Insanity: Canadian women seeking help for suicidal thoughts receives suggestion to commit ASSISTED SUICIDE .) The proposed bill is part of a broader push by the United Conservative Party (UCP) to enshrine personal health rights into provincial law. Alongside protections against being compelled to assist in euthanasia, the bill is expected to include the right to refuse vaccinations. This move follows the widespread controversy during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic , where vaccine mandates were implemented in various regions, including Alberta. Alberta Premier and leader of the UCP Danielle Smith has been a vocal advocate for personal medical choice. She has pledged that the new Bill of Rights will include amendments that ensure that Albertans have the right to make their own health decisions without fear of coercion or discrimination. This stance stems from concerns about how people were treated during the pandemic – particularly those who chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While the draft of the Bill of Rights is still subject to change, sources within the UCP indicate that it is being crafted by a small group working closely with legal experts and elected officials. The hope is that the final version will remain true to the draft's intent – providing robust protections for both health care workers and patients. Canada working to expand MAiD to allow mentally ill people to be euthanized The timing of Alberta's proposed legislation is particularly noteworthy, as it coincides with federal discussions on expanding MAiD to include individuals suffering solely from mental illness – a move that has been delayed until 2027 following significant pushback from various groups. Smith's support for these measures is part of a larger effort to enhance personal freedoms in Alberta. Earlier, she had proposed adding protections for vaccination status directly into the Alberta Human Rights Act. However, after receiving advice that this was not the appropriate legislation for such protections, Smith assured Albertans that a more suitable law would be introduced. Smith has publicly affirmed her commitment to these issues, stating that she believes every individual has the right to make their health assessments and decisions. She has promised that the updated Bill of Rights will reflect these values – providing a legal framework that upholds the rights of all Albertans. As Alberta prepares to introduce this Bill of Rights, the province may set a precedent for how medical freedom and personal choice are balanced with state mandates. This legislation could have significant implications not just for health care workers and patients in Alberta, but also for the broader conversation on medical ethics and personal autonomy in Canada.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-boosting-flexibility-can-help-you-live-longer.html,"Boosting your flexibility can help you live longer, study finds","Daily stretching could add more years to a person's life, according to recent research. Researchers have found an interesting link between flexibility and life expectancy in middle-aged people . Their findings suggest that those who are more flexible might face a lower risk of early death. Although it is well-established that physical fitness is essential for optimal health and longevity, most studies have focused primarily on cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength. This new research, however, shifts the spotlight to flexibility – a frequently neglected aspect of fitness – and explores its potential impact on how long people live. The researchers conducted a detailed flexibility assessment using a tool called the ""Flexitest,"" which measures the range of motion in 20 different movements across seven key joints in the study: ankles, elbows, hips, knees, shoulders, trunk and wrists. From these measurements, they developed a combined score, the ""Flexindex,"" to represent each person's overall body flexibility. Published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports , the study included nearly 3,139 middle-aged participants (2,087 men and 1,052 women), aged 45 to 65 years, from the CLINIMEX Exercise cohort in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The participants were monitored over an average of nearly 13 years to track their health and survival. People with higher Flexindex scores had a significantly lower chance of dying during the follow-up period. This link remained strong even after considering factors like age, body mass index (BMI) and general health. The impact of flexibility was especially noticeable at the extremes. For men, those in the lowest 10 percent of flexibility scores had a 21.2 percent death rate, while those in the top 10 percent had only a 7.8 percent death rate. Among women, the gap was even wider – a 15.4 percent death rate for the least flexible group compared to just two percent for the most flexible. Additionally, the study reinforced previous observations that women generally have greater flexibility than men. On average, women scored 35 percent higher on the Flexindex than men. Interestingly, women aged 61 to 65 were around 10 percent more flexible than men aged 46 to 50, despite being 15 years older. While the study doesn't conclusively prove that improving flexibility will extend life, it does indicate that flexibility could serve as an important indicator of overall health and lifespan. The researchers suggest that poor flexibility might be associated with other health conditions, such as chronic inflammation or stiff arteries, which could increase the risk of death. This study opens new doors for understanding the broader impacts of physical fitness on health. It implies that flexibility assessments like the Flexitest could be valuable in identifying individuals who may be at greater risk of dying early. Moreover, it prompts further exploration into whether targeted flexibility exercises might help boost longevity . Benefits of stretching regularly Regular stretching can improve your mobility, keep your body flexible and maintain independence as you age. Making stretching a regular habit brings many benefits – both mental and physical. Whether you enjoy cardio workouts or focus on strength training, stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine. Here are some key benefits of stretching regularly . Improved flexibility Increasing your flexibility through stretching makes everyday activities easier, such as bending down to pick something up, tying your shoelaces, or reaching for items on high shelves. It helps your body handle physical stress better and can improve your posture. Plus, having good flexibility reduces the risk of muscle cramps and can delay the loss of mobility that often comes with aging. Improved posture In today's digital world, many people spend hours sitting at desks in front of computers – often leading to poor posture like rounded backs or slumped shoulders. This not only affects your posture but also impacts blood flow and hormone levels over time–especially as you age. Stretching regularly can help correct these issues by easing tension in muscles that have adapted to these poor posture habits. It is important to note that fixing posture doesn’t happen overnight. Consistent stretching over time can gradually improve it and help align your body correctly. Muscle imbalances, which are quite common, can also contribute to poor posture. A study published in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science found that combining stretching with strengthening exercises for specific muscle groups can reduce pain and promote better body alignment , which, in turn, helps improve posture. Boosts physical performance Warming up with dynamic stretches before a workout can prime your muscles for activity – making you better prepared for physical exertion. Research published in Sports Medicine shows that warming up with stretches can help improve your performance in sports and other physical activities Builds muscle strength Contrary to popular belief, stretching is not just a light or mild form of exercise, it can help build strength. When you stretch, you lengthen your muscles, which can make your strength training more effective by allowing a greater range of motion. Additionally, stretching helps your muscles recover after a workout by reducing waste buildup and supplying more nutrients, which promotes muscle growth and health. Improves blood circulation Stretching before a workout increases your heart rate and enhances blood flow, delivering more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles. This enhanced blood flow helps prevent injuries as you exercise. Stretching also improves circulation throughout your body – benefiting your heart and kidneys. While pre-workout stretching is important, stretching during a workout can also be helpful. Doing static stretches mid-exercise can relieve tightness in your muscles. A study in the International Heart Journal suggests that regular stretching can boost circulation, speeding up recovery and reducing muscle soreness. Prevents and reduces lower back pain Lower back pain can be very limiting and painful, often caused by weak glute muscles or tight hip flexors, like the iliopsoas. These muscles play a role in relieving stress on your lower spine. Stretching them regularly can lower your risk of back pain . Tight muscles can restrict your range of motion, increasing the risk of muscle strains in your back. Stretching regularly can help heal existing back pain by loosening tight muscles and prevent future pain by keeping your muscles flexible and strong. Relieves muscle tension from stress When you’re stressed, your muscles tend to tighten, especially in areas like your neck, shoulders and upper back. Stretching these muscles can help release this tension, providing immediate relief from stress. By focusing on stretching the areas where you carry the most tension, you can help your body relax and reduce stress-related discomfort. (Related: Yoga and mindfulness-based therapy can help stressed-out employees improve their quality of life .) Calms the mind Stretching is not just about physical benefits; it also helps to calm your mind. When you stretch, you can focus on mindfulness and relaxation, which can help calm your mind and reduce mental stress. Activities like yoga combine stretching with controlled breathing and meditation , allowing you to slow down, find a sense of peace, and relax in today’s busy world.

In a recent interview about the new shot, Sir John, who teaches medicine at Oxford, seemed to suggest that one of the goals behind these injections is to mass sterilize the planet under the guise of protecting public health against the ""COVID virus."" ""These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilize a population,"" Sir John said with seeming disappointment during the interview. ""They're very likely to have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70 percent. We'll have to look quite carefully, and the regulators will have to look quite carefully to make sure that it's done what we need it to do before it gets approved."" A clinical trial for the shot is still ongoing and Sir John says there will be a ""delay"" between when the results are in and when regulators give the shot the green light for public release. Sir John was barely able to complete his sentence before the interviewer cut him off, apparently to keep him quiet from revealing any further incriminating information about the new Oxford shot. During a seemingly routine interview, Professor Sir John Bell, a key figure in the development of the Oxford vaccine, accidentally let slip a jaw-dropping bombshell that left the world in disbelief.

""Three developments have made the illness far less severe and essentially eliminated the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death in this historical order:"" Dr. McCullough wrote, emphasizing that the jabs are not one of those developments. ""1) Early multidrug treatment protocols 2) Natural immunity from prior strains 3) Mutation to less pathogenic Omicron variants"" Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, MD, agrees. She wrote in response to Dr. McCullough's post that the shots are ""all risk"" and ""no benefit."" ""Profits over safety,"" she added. ""The shots should have been pulled off the market a long time ago.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-deadly-mrna-clot-shots-military-project-by-nih.html,"DEADLY mRNA clot shots revealed to be a MILITARY PROJECT developed by NIH, not Moderna and Pfizer, as we were all led to believe","Did you know that military contractors created the experimental gene therapy injections that trick human cells into producing billions of toxic spike prions in the blood? Did you know that NIH owns 50 percent of the patents for the mRNA vaccines that Moderna and Pfizer pushed out on the populace? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is blowing the whistle on the whole operation, and should Trump win the presidency this fall, look for the crooks and criminals responsible for this plandemic tragedy to serve hard time in federal prison for it. In fact, Pfizer and Moderna were “paid to put their stamps on those vaccines as if they came from the pharmaceutical industry,” according to RFK Jr., because it was a military project from the very beginning. Why would the military be involved in developing heart-crippling biological weapons of mass destruction that were distributed and injected into 270 million Americans? There is a long history of the Communist Chinese Party (CCP) employing their People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to create biowarfare weapons, and now it appears that they partnered with National Institutes of Health (NIH) to use gain-of-function research to create Covid-19, create deadly vaccines to “prevent” it and its spread. Then, the CCP colluded with NIH and pretended that the pharmaceutical industry created the jabs to “save” everyone, even though the spike protein injections are military-grade biological weapons of mass destruction, designed to kill humans and were created for that reason by the military. Never forget the United States used small pox virus as a biological weapon to wipe out the indigenous Native Americans, so if you’re thinking this coverage of mRNA jabs as biological weapons used by the U.S. military and Big Pharma against Americans is too far-fetched, think again. U.S. Military, NIH, CCP collaborated to create and patent biological weapons of mass destruction to wipe out billions of humans across the globe Biological weapons are comprised of toxic materials produced from pathogenic organisms with the intention of wrecking biological processes of a host, thus incapacitating or exterminating that host, which in this case is human. There are unlimited types of microorganisms that can be used as biological weapons because they are highly toxic, inexpensive, simple to obtain, easy to transfer between humans and easy to disperse (think aerosols or vaccines here). Typical microbes used for biological weapons include viruses, bacteria (anthrax and botulism), fungi and toxins from plants and animals. As of late, Big Pharma is using venom peptides from poisonous animals (snakes, snails, spiders, scorpions, frogs) for prescription medicines. This is widely documented. The U.S. military is involved in distributing biological weapons of mass destruction on more fronts than just one. Yes, the Covid clot shots are like Trojan horses in that they sneak gene mutation “technology” into your cells, so they create microscopic prions that clog the vascular system like tiny weapons that destroy vital human systemic functions. The U.S. military also is responsible for disseminating aerosol toxins into the atmosphere known as “chem-trails,” and this is certainly a biological weapon of mass destruction, as human respiratory systems and our environment (including crops) are contaminated with heavy metal toxins, hospital hazardous waste, bacteria, viruses and the list goes on.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-vaxxed-3-exposes-widespread-injuries-deaths-covid-shots.html,"Coming Sept. 18: ‘Vaxxed 3 exposes widespread injuries, deaths following COVID shots, hospital protocols","A team from Children’s Health Defense (CHD) last year spent nine months traversing the country in a bus, collecting testimonies from families, medical professionals, whistleblowers and others whose lives were devastated by injury and death following COVID-19 vaccines and hospital treatment protocols. (Article by Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) A new documentary, “ Vaxxed 3 : Authorized to Kill,” premiering in theaters across the country on Sept. 18, compiles clips from over a thousand interviews with the everyday people who visited the bus to share their stories. The interviews reveal a radical consistency in the experiences related by those who were injured and by the families who lost their loved ones and in the descriptions of abuse and neglect perpetrated by practitioners and hospitals. “These were fundamental violations of human rights,” said Kim Mack Rosenberg, CHD general counsel. The film opens with mainstream media clips from throughout the pandemic reporting information that was later proven untrue — that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and effective, would stop transmission and end the pandemic, and that the unvaccinated were responsible for the vaccines’ failures. The information circulating in the media “didn’t add up,” said Polly Tommey, director of CHD.TV who led the project. So, she thought, “There’s only one thing left to do. We need to get on a bus and get back out on the road and find out what is going on because only the people will tell us the truth.” In the film, the bus interviews are interwoven with commentary from top legal and medical experts, including CHD CEO Mary Holland, Mack Rosenberg, Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Paul Marik, Dr. Paul Thomas, Dr. Ryan Cole, CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker, and others. Together, they offer insight into the lies told by public health officials, the profit incentives, the coercion and the “unrelenting propaganda and censorship” that led to what Tommey called “mass murder on a level that is difficult to comprehend.” Vaccine-injured people and their families share stories of paralysis, myocarditis , cancer , seizures, organ failure, Guillain Barré , postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and other adverse reactions . Many broke down in tears, some even experienced physical symptoms from their injuries during their interviews. They also shared their desperation. “This is not a quality of life,” one woman cried. “It is when you start thinking, OK, how do I end my life?” ‘There was so much death’ Families of those who lost husbands, wives and children sobbed as they shared stories of being separated from their loved ones who were left to die alone. “My father died alone in the worst possible way,” one woman told Tommy. “And it’s horrible because there’s no accountability and the guilt and regrets are left to us.” They told stories of following doctors’ recommendations and taking loved ones who were mildly ill with low oxygen into the hospital where they were put on ventilators or a cocktail of heavy drugs against their will and then died . Families reported that they weren’t informed their loved ones were being treated with heavy drugs. “I’m the healthcare power of attorney,” said one father, whose daughter died after five days on Precedex — which according to its label should not be administered for more than 24 hours. “Why wasn’t I told what they’re doing?” In an emotional testimonial, a medical coder and whistleblower — who reviewed patient records and assigned codes for diagnoses and treatments that allowed hospitals and physicians to get paid — explained how financial incentives for hospitals treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 led to mass testing. Positive COVID-19 tests were used to justify the use of ventilators — even when hospitals realized they were killing people — and the administration of remdesivir , which is known to cause kidney damage. Even the World Health Organization recommended against the use of remdesivir after finding no evidence that it improved outcomes. Yet Dr. Anthony Fauci determined it should be the standard of care in U.S. hospitals — at more than $3,000 per patient . Interviewees reported their loved ones were put on the drug and then died. Nurses told Tommey in interviews that they saw the same thing happen over and over. “The majority of hospital deaths “were actually caused by Anthony Fauci,” Cole said, because his National Institutes of Health issued protocols that, if adhered to by hospitals, led to “big bonuses, lots of money.” “I knew they were killing people in the hospital,” the medical coder said. “I would cry myself to sleep at night … There was so much death. It was almost unbearable.” “It’s unbelievable,” Tommy said. “You may be watching this right now and say, can’t be. I wouldn’t have believed it myself if I hadn’t heard it. Not once, twice, but hundreds and hundreds of times. And still now as I’m doing this interview, I have 40, 50 a week interviews of COVID hospital protocol deaths . How many did they kill?” Doctors and nurses provided detailed insight into the complex billing process that generated large profits for pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Many of them also shared how their care strategies changed, as they tried to help patients avoid hospitals. “We’d do anything we could to keep people out of the hospital,” one doctor said. “I was managing acutely ill people at their home, going to their home, doing whatever I needed to do to treat them,” said another. The film also covers the suppression of unprofitable treatments shown to be effective, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine — compiling clips from mainstream media calling it a horse drug and interviews with families detailing how their appeals for the drugs were denied and mocked. “They politicized it and demonized it,” Kory said, talking about ivermectin. “And many, many, many people died needless deaths because they didn’t know of its efficacy.” Kory called the media’s treatment of the drug a “disinformation campaign,” which he said was equally deployed around the vaccine and the demonization of the unvaccinated. Because of that demonization, he added, the unvaccinated weren’t afforded the same care as the vaccinated when they did go to hospitals. “So the patients were undertreated, mistreated, maltreated and died because of money. And it boils down to that. It really boils down to that,” Cole said. The film also honors the brave healthcare workers who did care for people, those who resisted the pressure to comply and offers hope for a growing number of people who have “woken up” to the dangers of a corrupt public health system, willing to sacrifice people to dangerous healthcare protocols for profit . “Thank God for those brave nurses that spoke about the disgustingness that went on the hospital because they really validated what the parents and the people who lost loved ones were saying,” one interviewee said. “Many lost their licenses and were told they would never work in healthcare again because of spreading misinformation. But they were just telling us simply what they saw,” she said. Another said she was scared for the future of medicine. “Now we are left with medical facilities full of people who don’t have a backbone to stand up and do the right thing.” Tommy said the people interviewed on the bus tour were just a fraction of those who have suffered and it is important to keep gathering and sharing their stories and raising awareness. “We are 8 billion people against a few thousand controligarchs ,” Holland said. “We will win this.” “We will continue, Children’s Health Defense will continue, until there is justice and this never ever happens again,” said Tommey.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-joe-rogan-blasts-media-real-numbers-covid-deaths.html,"Joe Rogan blasts media for failing to publish “real numbers” of people injured, killed by COVID jabs","Bret Weinstein, PhD, appeared on "" The Joe Rogan Experience"" the other day to discuss the mainstream media's handling of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccine"" injuries and deaths. During their discourse, host Joe Rogan went on a tirade about how the world does not even know the true numbers of injuries and deaths because the media refuses to publish the ""real numbers."" Rogan believes that the reason it is all crickets from the corporate media is because many pundits and reporters got the jab and are now ""probably freaking the **** out,"" to quote his crude statement. Weinstein agreed, adding that Big Pharma and government regulators at the FDA and CDC are also complicit. They made a lot of money pushing modRNA (mRNA) injections as ""medicine,"" and they are not about to stop after seeing the success of their deception. Most ""kind, intelligent"" people, Rogan told Weinstein, find it hard to believe that there are actually people out there who ""are willing to profit off of injecting babies with things that may very well **** them up for the rest of their life."" ""There's no way anyone's that evil,"" Rogan continued. ""Then when you start looking into the evidence, you read 'Turtles All the Way Down' or 'Dissolving Illusions' and it's just, like, wait, wait, wait."" (Related: Did you catch Joe Rogan's chat with Tucker Carlson earlier this year about how the FBI and CIA are enemies of the American people?) Vaccine injured are ""entitled to our compassion,"" says Weinstein Weinstein, who co-hosts ""The DarkHorse Podcast"" joined Rogan in debunking the myth that COVID jabs are somehow responsible for saving people's lives. The truth is the exact opposite: COVID jabs kill and nothing more. One would think that after all the revelations that have come out in recent years that the U.S. government would back off on pushing the experimental drugs. Instead, the FDA just emergency-approved yet another COVID jab for the latest ""strain"" of the ""virus."" Rogan recalled when musical artist Eric Clapton was injured by COVID jabs and spoke out about it. Instead of the public showing him sympathy, they called Clapton ""the most hurtful of words."" ""The gaslighting of the [vaccine] injured is insane,"" Weinstein added. ""How is it someone who suffers an adverse event is not entitled to our compassion?"" Big Pharma stands to lose a lot if ever held accountable for its crimes against humanity, which is why said crimes continue unabated. The government keeps giving the pharmaceutical industry the green light to churn out more jabs so the money flows, and nobody does a thing about it. ""Their real goal was to normalize the use of a gene therapy on a population that had never had that idea placed in its mind,"" Weinstein told Rogan. Now that most of the general public seems to not care whatsoever that mRNA has been unleashed, the drug industry will simply use the mRNA platform to ""reformulate every vaccine they've got to create a bunch of new vaccines,"" Weinstein says, warning that the estimated profits from this conversion will be well into the trillions. Weinstein and Rogan further discussed gain-of-function research and how it is being used to develop new COVID-like bioweapons for future release. They also discussed election fraud and other current affairs. ""Apart from all the money made by the pharmaceutical industry and all the other players involved in the Covid pandemic, it should be obvious that the other obvious objective is to kill people and to reduce the population,"" one commenter wrote about the discussion.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-dutch-healthcare-workers-worried-ukrainian-soldiers-superbugs.html,Dutch healthcare workers worried about Ukrainian soldiers potentially bringing SUPERBUGS into Europe,"Several European hospitals are on alert due to an alarming sudden increase in antibiotic-resistant infections among Ukrainian patients . The infections can't be treated with common antibiotics and have been linked to poor health care and the overuse of antibiotics in Ukraine. Reports have warned that the spread of these superbugs could pose a serious threat to public health across Europe. Experts are also worried that these resistance patterns might be linked to possible experimental biological testing on Ukrainian soldiers, which has also sparked worries about a secret bioweapons program . The superbugs are often found in Ukrainian soldiers undergoing treatment in the Netherlands, and healthcare workers are worried that they can be transmitted to Dutch patients who were previously unexposed to infections. (Related: UN report warns that SUPERBUGS could kill up to 10M people each year by 2050 .) Experts have also suggested that Ukrainian soldiers carry superbugs because Ukrainian doctors often prescribe antibiotics to patients, unlike their Dutch counterparts. According to reports, these superbug infections have occurred at least ""three times between February 2022 and August 2023."" The first case was announced in a research letter for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Germany in August 2023, when a Ukrainian soldier was diagnosed with several dangerous infections that were not treatable with antibiotics. According to the German CDC report, the first case was officially registered in Germany. The injured Ukrainian soldier was first taken from Dnipro to Kyiv. He was later taken to an American military hospital in Germany , where he was tested for infections and the unexpected discovery was made. Doctors took blood, urine, respiratory and peri-rectal surveillance cultures from the patient. Surveillance cultures grew A. baumannii , Enterococcus faecium , Klebsiella pneumoniae and two distinct morphologies of P. aeruginosa . The paper also revealed that blood cultures grew a third P. aeruginosa . Using the Vitek 2 automated system, doctors found that the gram-negative organisms were ""non-susceptible to almost every antibiotic tested."" Ukrainian soldiers carrying different types of resistant bacteria Data from the National Coordination Center for Patient Distribution also revealed that Dutch hospitals have treated 143 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Some of the soldiers have been treated for serious injuries. A Dutch clinical microbiologist warned that it is unprecedented for the Netherlands to ""see how many different types of resistant bacteria they already carry with them."" Russia has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was conducting illegal research in biolabs across Ukraine and other countries near Russian borders. Meanwhile, Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops said that Washington is working on a ""universal"" genetically engineered bioweapon designed to cause severe damage to enemies comparable to that of a ""nuclear winter."" According to a report from Russia's Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian military personnel were allegedly involved in experiments designed to detect the body’s tolerance for dangerous infectious diseases. The experiments included injecting test subjects with ""higher doses of antibiotics, which, in turn, lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in their bodies.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-how-your-body-tells-you-burned-out.html,How your body tells you that you’re on the verge of BURNOUT,"Licensed clinical psychologist Molly Burretts believes recognizing the early signs of burnout is crucial to prevent or manage it effectively. According to Burretts, burnout symptoms typically fall into three main categories: physical, emotional and behavioral . Burnout is a condition where a person feels emotionally, mentally and often physically drained due to long-term or recurring stress. Burnout can stem from various aspects of one's life, notably work, personality and lifestyle. A lack of awareness about the root cause of a person's burnout, combined with societal pressures and stereotypes, can make individuals feel like their struggles are personal failings. Consequently, they may be reluctant to share their challenges with others, hampering their recovery from burnout . Burnout can manifest through various symptoms. Here are some of the most common: Physical symptoms Changes in appetite. Burnout can cause fluctuations in appetite, leading to either overeating comfort foods or skipping meals . Research suggests a link between diet and burnout, though it is unclear which causes the other. Exhaustion. Feeling constantly drained is often seen as the hallmark of burnout. The recent lockdowns have intensified feelings of exhaustion, as people continue to struggle with navigating new challenges like remote work and virtual schooling. Frequent tension headaches. A 2023 study published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research found that 65 percent of people experiencing burnout reported frequent tension headaches , compared to 41 percent of those not experiencing burnout. Gut problems. Burnout can also show up as gastrointestinal issues. The same study noted that many participants experienced constipation, indigestion, gas, nausea and stomach pain. Sleep issues. Burnout and poor sleep are closely linked, with each potentially worsening the other. Improving sleep through better habits and mindfulness may help alleviate burnout symptoms. Vision changes. Prolonged stress can affect vision , leading to symptoms like blurred vision, dry eyes, eye strain and sensitivity to light. Emotional symptoms Tasks feel draining. Routine activities start to feel unusually exhausting and require more energy to complete than they should. Lack of challenge. When work becomes unchallenging. It can feel more burdensome, making each task seem harder than it is. Sense of uselessness. Burnout can diminish one's sense of effectiveness, leading to a cycle where people feel like they can't accomplish anything no matter how hard they try. Doubting the value of your work. Burned out people might start questioning whether their work matters, especially in fields like education or healthcare. Persistent feelings of ""What's the point?"" or ""Is my work making a difference?"" are strong indicators of burnout. Behavioral symptoms Signs of depression. Burnout and depression share similar symptoms like difficulty concentrating and losing interest in tasks. Cynicism and irritability. The World Health Organization identifies cynicism and irritability as key indicators of burnout. People who are burned out might start viewing their work negatively or feel more easily irritated. Everything starts to get on their nerves, and even minor inconveniences can feel overwhelming. The United States Surgeon General's 2023 Work in America survey found that 19 percent of U.S. workers experience anger or irritability towards co-workers and customers, signaling potential burnout. Seeking comfort in unhealthy habits. Burnout can lead people to turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as drug and alcohol consumption, excessive exercise or overeating. Difficulty focusing. People who are burned out may notice their minds wandering more frequently, making it hard to concentrate and complete tasks at work. How to prevent or recover from burnout Recognizing burnout is the crucial first step in addressing it. Here are some strategies to help people recover from and prevent further burnout . Embrace change. Be open to making changes in both personal and work life. Burnout often signals a systemic issue rather than a personal failure. Sometimes, the best option for one's mental health is to seek a new environment that can better support individual well-being. Limit screen time. Excessive screen time can worsen symptoms of burnout – contributing to depression and low self-esteem. It is often linked to overworking, such as constantly checking work emails. Setting clear boundaries and reducing screen time can help ease burnout symptoms . Prioritize self-care. Incorporate self-care into a routine. Burnout often stems from taking on too much at work without considering emotional well-being. Make time for activities that can feel rejuvenating. Take a break. Taking a break from work is one of the most effective ways to recover from burnout. Common triggers include conflicts with co-workers , emotional labor, poor working hours and unrealistic workloads. Whether it's reducing excess work hours or taking a short stay-cation or extended sabbatical, stepping away can help people recharge. Seek professional help. Consider speaking with a mental health professional about burnout. While it is not considered a medical condition, burnout can significantly impact mental health and overall quality of life. A therapist can offer coping strategies and stress management techniques. The feelings of cynicism, depression and fatigue typical of burnout often arise when individuals feel powerless over their responsibilities – whether at work, school or home. Tasks that conflict with a person's values or goals or the pursuit of objectives that don't resonate can further exacerbate these feelings. Without adequate support, burnout can lead to a host of mental and physical health issues , including headaches, digestive problems, fatigue and an increased risk of substance misuse. The consequences of burnout can be severe if ignored. Openly discussing these challenges with family members, trusted friends or a therapist is often the crucial first step toward managing symptoms, seeking help and preventing further negative outcomes.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-tv-drug-ads-not-what-you-get.html,"With TV drug ads, what you see is not necessarily what you get","Triumphant music plays as cancer patients go camping, do some gardening, and watch fireworks in ads for Opdivo+Yervoy , a combination of immunotherapies to treat metastatic melanoma and lung cancer. Ads for Skyrizi , a medicine to treat plaque psoriasis and other illnesses, show patients snorkeling and riding bikes — flashing their rash-free elbows. People with Type 2 diabetes dance and sing around their office carrels, tipping their hats to Jardiance . Drugs now come with celebrity endorsements: Wouldn’t you want the migraine treatment endorsed by Lady Gaga, Nurtec ODT ? (Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal republished from KFFHealthNews.org ) Drug ads have been ubiquitous on TV since the late 1990s and have spilled onto the internet and social media. The United States and New Zealand are the only countries that legally allow direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. (The European Union was furious when Lady Gaga ’s Instagram post promoting the migraine drug was visible on the continent, noting it flagrantly violated its ban on direct-to-consumer advertising.) Manufacturers have spent more than $1 billion a month on ads in recent years. Last year, three of the top five spenders on TV advertising were drug companies. Such promotion was banned until 1997, when the FDA reluctantly allowed pharmaceutical ads on TV, so long as they gave an accurate accounting of a medicine’s true benefits and risks, including a list of potential side effects. With those guardrails in place, few thought advertising would take hold. But the FDA underestimated the wiliness of the pharmaceutical industry, which invented a new art form: finding ways to make their wares seem like joyous must-have treatments, while often minimizing lackluster efficacy and risks. A 2023 study found that, among top-selling drugs, those with the lowest levels of added benefit tended to spend more on advertising to patients than doctors. “I worry that direct-to-consumer advertising can be used to drive demand for marginally effective drugs or for drugs with more affordable or more cost-effective alternatives,” the study’s author, Michael DiStefano, a professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Colorado, said in an email. Indeed, more than 50% of what Medicare spent on drugs from 2016 through 2018 was for drugs that were advertised. Half of the 10 drugs that the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration targeted for drug price negotiation this year are among the drugs with the largest direct-to-consumer ad spend. The government has, in recent years, tried to ensure that prescription-drug advertising gives a more accurate and easily understood picture of benefits and harms. But the results have been disappointing. When President Donald Trump’s administration tried to get drugmakers to list the price of any treatments costing over $35 on TV ads, for example, the industry took it to federal court , saying the mandate violated drugmakers’ First Amendment rights. Big Pharma won . Last November, the FDA issued requirements that ads give consumers a “non-misleading net impression about the advertised drug.” The agency stated that information had to be presented in a “clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner.” Ads must avoid “audio or visual elements that might interfere with the consumer’s understanding” and “text information is presented in a way that is easy to read.” But the language is disappointingly vague: What do “neutral” and “non-misleading” mean? Do the proscribed audio-visual elements include people hiking, or dancing to upbeat music? How quickly or slowly can the chyrons listing adverse reactions scurry across your screen? There is no FDA police force to decide how the language should be interpreted. I asked the agency for an interview to get some clarity on its plans, but instead got a three-page email that, well, left me worrying that the blizzard of drug ads is here to stay. It told me that ads are not vetted before airing unless the manufacturers voluntarily submit them because it is “the drugmakers’ responsibility to make sure they comply.” How do they catch ads that are noncompliant? Often, via consumer complaints, or when an agency staff member sees a booth with misleading information at a conference, the email said. Within the FDA’s watchdog arm, the Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch, “there are currently nine full-time employees, and a small percentage of their work includes review of DTC promotional communications, as well as other activities,” according to the agency email. If ads are determined to be noncompliant, the FDA can notify the manufacturer by sending it an “untitled or warning letter.” From 2019 to 2024, it sent a total of just 32. ...Read more at: KFFHealthNews.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-malone-explains-how-covid19-vaccines-cause-cancer.html,Dr. Malone explains how COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer in latest congressional hearing discussing vaccine injuries,"In a recent congressional hearing led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Dr. Robert Malone, a prominent critic of COVID-19 vaccines, explained how COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer by DESIGN . Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is actually a biological weapon that contains billions of DNA fragments that pose cancer risks. Malone suggests that the “vaccines” – which were pushed onto tens of millions of people worldwide – may carry potential health hazards that were not previously disclosed to the public. Dr. Malone lambasts Moderna and Pfizer for pushing vaccines with known cancer risks Dr. Malone’s statements were made during a hearing titled “ Injuries Caused by COVID-19 Vaccines ,” where he detailed findings from Moderna’s patent and independent research into the vaccine’s composition. According to Dr. Malone, Moderna's patent acknowledges that RNA is preferable to DNA for vaccine use due to the risks of ""insertional mutagenesis,"" which can activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes. “Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines, which explicitly states that RNA is superior to DNA due to the risks associated with DNA,” Dr. Malone said. “However, despite this, their mRNA vaccine has been found to contain billions of DNA fragments.” Dr. Malone criticized Moderna’s vaccine production process, arguing that the DNA contamination results from the method used to manufacture the RNA vaccine. “Moderna uses DNA to create RNA, and then they degrade the DNA. Unfortunately, their purification process does not fully remove the degraded DNA,” he explained. In addition to Moderna, Dr. Malone claimed that Pfizer’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine also contains similar DNA contaminants. He pointed to researchers from the United States and Canada, who conducted independent analyses of unopened vaccine vials. The researchers discovered DNA fragments in the vaccines, including sequences from the Simian Virus 40 (SV40), a virus associated with cancer. As Malone points out, these sequences are known to cause DNA damage, birth defects, and potential cancer development. Moderna and Pfizer have both responded to these claims by asserting the safety and efficacy of their vaccines. Moderna maintains that their vaccine meets all safety standards, and Pfizer has similarly defended the purity of its vaccine. Both companies have emphasized that their vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and review by regulatory agencies. However, the FDA has dismissed reputable, third-party laboratory findings on DNA contamination of the vaccines, ignoring the repercussions these findings have for public health. However, Moderna and Pfizer already knew that DNA is a contaminant in their vaccines. The FDA even allowed Pfizer to change their manufacturing process to make way for this undisclosed cancer nightmare. The very design of the mRNA vaccines requires the use of DNA to make the RNA. These companies know that the process of degrading the DNA leaves room for error, contaminating vaccine supplies with billions of fragments of cancer-causing DNA. The risk of insertional mutagenesis from this process is well known. This contamination can activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes, leading to aggressive cancers and new cancer diagnoses in younger people. Related: New studies add to growing body of scientific evidence linking COVID-19 vaccines to cancer . Researchers shocked to find DNA contamination in COVID vaccine vials Dr. Phillip Buckhaults, a cancer genomics expert, spoke about these findings earlier in the year in front of the South Carolina Senate Medical Affairs Ad-Hoc Committee on the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Buckhaults, who has a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology, studies how genes cause cancer. He and his team specialize in detecting foreign pieces of DNA in places where they can incorporate or interfere with healthy genetic expression. ""The Pfizer vaccine is contaminated with plasmid DNA. It’s not just mRNA, it’s got bits of DNA in it."" Prof. Buckhaults said in front of the South Carolina Senate committee. Prof. Buckhaults retrieved a vial of Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine from a colleague who was working with the vaccination program in Columbia, South Carolina. Professor Buckhaults sequenced all the DNA from those vials. He was shocked to see the DNA in the final samples. He said, ""You can kind of work out what it is and how it got there and I’m kind of alarmed about the possible consequences of this both in terms of human health and biology.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-video-exposes-connection-abortion-organ-harvesting-vaccines.html,"New Pro-Life video exposes disturbing connection between abortion, organ harvesting, and vaccine development","A new pro-life video released by CHOICE42 will bring tears to your eyes, as it reveals the connections between abortions, organ trafficking and vaccine development. The video, titled ""It’s OK,"" premiered on The Steve Deace Show on The Blaze Network, and is the third installment in a series aiming to expose the dark and hidden realities of the abortion industry, and its connection to today’s vaccines. Child sacrifice, Machiavellian science and the vaccine industry The video chronicles the short lives of five babies — Ellie, David, Johanna, Jordan and Bo — whose organs were harvested post-abortion to create fetal cell lines used in medical research and vaccine development. Opening with a haunting message from Ellie, who introduces herself as an aborted baby from 1962, the video illustrates how these cell lines were obtained. “The doctor worked with scientists, and they took my organs out as soon as I was aborted,” Ellie’s animated character explains. Laura Klassen, director and founder of CHOICE42, revealed in a statement that her initial awareness of fetal organ harvesting and its use in vaccine development came during the launch of mandatory COVID-19 vaccines. She expressed her frustrations with those who justify and rationalize the use of fetal cell lines for vaccine experiments. Fact checkers claim that only one baby was involved in the development of vaccines, and others justify the heinous act by claiming that the fetal tissue is dead and donated for scientific purposes. “The justifications are false,” Klassen asserted. “It’s not acceptable that it happened in the 1960s, and it’s not acceptable that it continues today.” The video asserts that hundreds of experiments are conducted on aborted babies before a viable cell line is obtained, with shocking details provided on the number of experiments performed on individual babies. These are death-camp like experiments reminiscent of the ones conducted in Auschwitz in Nazi, Germany. To develop WI-38 cells for vaccines, a married couple who felt like they had too many children elected to terminate their pregnancy at three to four months. The baby Ellie was one of thirty-two babies maimed at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden to get just the right lung cells for vaccine development. For Jordan, the mother wanted to get rid of the fetus out of her convenience. The abortion was conducted between 16-18 weeks at Leiden University in the Netherlands. An unknown number of babies were killed to establish the PER.C6 fetal line for medical research. For Bo — who would ultimately become the source for Walvax-2 cells — the mother aborted her baby at three months, giving up the baby’s lungs for vaccine research. There was a total of nine fetuses murdered to establish the Walvax-2 cells for vaccine development. The abortion was conducted at the Wuhan University in China. To develop the HEK-293 line for vaccines, at least 293 experiments were conducted; of which, Johanna was murdered at three months to get just the right kidneys for vaccine development. To develop the MRC-5 fetal cell line in 1966, a mother used “psychiatric reasons” to abort her baby David. At least five babies were killed to get just the perfect lungs from David. The abortion took place in the UK. These cells are commonly used for vaccines today. Live experiments on babies continue One particularly disturbing fact is that these babies are experimented on while they are alive, without anesthesia, to preserve the viability of the cells. Dr. Ian Donald, a pioneer in ultrasound technology, is quoted in the video recounting his observations of these gruesome procedures. According to Dr. Donald, “Experiments were being performed on near-term alive aborted babies who were not even afforded the mercy of anesthetic as they writhed and cried in agony.” The video also reveals that fetal cell lines are still being used in contemporary vaccine development, including mRNA COVID vaccines . Cell lines from Johanna and Jordan were utilized in the production of these biological weapons. The video argues that the practice of harvesting organs from aborted babies, far from being a relic of the past, remains a current issue, with even recent cases, like that of Bo in 2015, contributing to ongoing cell line supplies. The Center for Medical Progress has documented in undercover videos that the trafficking of fetal organs continues to this day, right inside taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood facilities. In response to the video, doctors and abortion advocates maintain that fetal cell lines are not obtained from new abortions but from existing cell lines. They argue that these cell lines are used to advance medical research without directly causing harm to new individuals. However, the video challenges this narrative, calling for a re-evaluation of the ethical implications of using such cell lines and urging a stop to the practice altogether. The cell lines that were invented decades ago do not replicate forever, and need to be replaced. Accessible abortion policies provide a steady stream of new fetuses to experiment on, ensuring that there is a fresh supply of organs and fetal cell lines for the vaccine industry to experiment with.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-usda-colluding-china-build-bird-flu-bioweapon.html,USDA colluding with China to build bird flu BIOWEAPON with gain-of-function research,"The United States government is once again colluding with communist China to build a deadly bioweapon, this time from circulating strains of avian flu. The White Coat Waste Project (WCW Project) recently obtained Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents showing that U.S. taxpayer money is being funneled to a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) laboratory on mainland China that is tampering with bird flu through highly controversial gain-of-function research. Before the proof came out, career politician Tom Vilsack, who currently holds the title of secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), lied under oath by claiming that the U.S. is not colluding with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to build more deadly bioweapons. Back in March during an exchange with Congressman Ben Cline, Vilsack vehemently denied any notion of ""collaboration"" taking place between the CCP and Washington. Vilsack said all U.S. data has been ""basically walled off,"" the suggestion being that the Chinese government has no access to it. ""It's really not a collaboration per se,"" Vilsack said. ""To my knowledge, there is not [data] sharing ... all of this is basically walled off, so everything we're doing stays with us; it doesn't necessarily go to the UK or to China."" (Related: Did you know that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $9.5 million to the University of Wisconsin – Madison to develop a new form of H5N1 bird flu that is transmissible to humans?) Vilsack's department ignored Congressional request for information To verify Vilsack's claims, Congress wrote him a follow-up letter a few weeks after the exchange with Cline requesting further information about the matter. As you might expect, Vilsack's department never responded. It took diligent sleuths at the WCW Project to file FOIA requests allowing them access to the 2021 grant application the USDA under Vilsack signed called ""U.S.-UK-China Collab: Predictive Phylogenetics for Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Newly Emerging Avian Influenza Viruses"" that proves Vilsack to be a liar. Said document shows that American researchers employed by the USDA traveled to China and disclosed all of the information that Vilsack claims was ""walled off."" So much for being the ""most open and transparent administration in American history."" It turns out that Vilsack flat-out lied about the very real collaboration that took place between Washington and China to develop a bird flu bioweapon. He also lied about U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for this bioweapon. ""Tom Vilsack is a liar who perjured himself and should be prosecuted for it,"" writes Ben Bartee for Armageddon Prose . ""More importantly, the milking of the public treasury to engineer dangerous new pathogens – particularly in offshore and opaque Chinese labs, given recent history – should be a non-starter, no exceptions."" As usual, the American public is completely in the dark about what is happening with their own tax dollars. More COVID-like bioweapons are being built in the background while the world waits for another ""pandemic"" to emerge as promised. ""This is not just malfeasance: it is complicit, treasonous evil,"" a commenter wrote about these developments. ""The CCP / global cabal death cult will duke it out for ultimate power once they have killed off 80 percent of the population."" ""The puppet regime put into power by our fraudulent 2020 election is poised to drive the final nail into our collective coffins (quite literally) with the 2024 election. They are flaunting their confidence by presenting the two most moronic clowns ever to be run up the preverbal flag pole as candidates to run this nation. It is the ultimate FU to the citizens and sheep here in the USA, designed to show us useless eaters / breeders that they can and will force anything down our throats, because we seem to lack the will to stop them.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-evolved-polio-infected-chinese-boy-leaked-lab-wuhan.html,Highly evolved polio strain that infected Chinese boy suspected to have “leaked” from same Wuhan lab as COVID,"Another deadly virus is in circulation after the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in communist China ""leaked"" a new deadly strain of polio called WIV14 that infected a young boy in China's Anhui province. A paper from France's Pasteur Institute suggests that this new ""highly evolved"" strain of polio was more than likely developed at the WIV. It is said to be 99 percent similar to the Saukett A strain of polio used in laboratory settings and in vaccine production. Dr. Maël Bessaud, who led the research, says WIV14 probably came from the WIV or another facility that handles polio. The only other possible origins of WIV14 include a natural reservoir or another lab. (Related: Did you know that polio vaccines are responsible for unleashing RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] into the population?) U.S. taxpayer dollars must stop flowing to communist China If WIV14 did come from the WIV, then this is just more evidence that lab safety protocols at one of China's highest security-level biosafety facilities is sorely lacking and in desperate need of reform before another Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is unleashed upon the world. U.S. taxpayer dollars also need to stop being sent to the WIV to continue this type of research. Thanks to Tony Fauci and other career criminals, the WIV has been on the dole of U.S. taxpayer-funded grant money for many years, which it uses to develop deadly bioweapons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also sends cash to the WIV to fund projects aimed at enhancing the virulence of avian flu, as one example. The claim is that manipulating viruses to make them more deadly will help researchers to develop ""cures"" in the form of more vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs. The same study found that Peter Daszak, the Fauci-linked researcher whose EcoHealth Alliance group was accused of participating in the Wuhan lab leak of COVID, continued to receive cash from the U.S. government up until this year. Daszak used that money to tinker with exotic viruses sourced from bats, pangolins and other wild animals. The only reason Daszak is no longer on the U.S. taxpayer dole is because Rep. Brad Wenstrup's (R-Oh.) Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic successfully argued that Daszak was non-compliant with the grant terms of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in that he completely disregarded the warnings not to conduct gain-of-function research, which is illegal on U.S. soil. ""The findings underscore the shocking unsafe state of global virology research,"" said Dr. Richard Ebright , a Harvard-trained molecular biologist, to the DailyMail Online about the research. WIV14 is believed to have evolved from a well-preserved strain of polio collected back in the 1950s for use in vaccine production. Somehow, it leaked from its source and infected a young child – and it could still be out there circulating. The close proximity of the WIV to the Anhui province where the WIV14 case was reported strongly suggests that the WIV is responsible for the release of this deadly new bioweapon. The World Health Organization (WHO) counted 125 positive samples of polio in Afghanistan last year, located to the west of China, along with 34 more -- so far -- in 2024. Afghanistan, Pakistan and even Gaza are said to be among the most prominent places where new strains of polio are appearing. In 2022, polio reemerged in the United States for the first time in more than a decade. According to reports, it was detected more than 70 times in New York's sewage. However, that could just be vaccine shedding. It sounds as though it might be time to shut down the Wuhan Institute of Virology for continuing to build and ""leak"" deadly viruses into the world.

Back in 2019, we were all warned. “ Human composting ” was legalized in the state of Washington in Bill 5001 entitled “Concerning human remains,” that legalized the “natural organic reduction” of human remains. No, we’re not talking about gelatin here, where the warped American food industry reduces pig, cow, turkey, chicken and other animal cartilage, muscles and other body parts humans normally don’t eat. We are talking about boiling down and incinerating dead people into powder, sludge and compost for inserting into the food supply, and nobody knows it’s happening right now. Alkaline hydrolysis, a.k.a. aquamation, used to reduce human flesh for fertilizing food, watering crops, and as calcium phosphate “filler” for cheap supplements Coroners and embalmers are blowing the whistle on one of the grossest atrocities now happening to American food, water and cheap supplements. Alkaline hydrolysis, also called liquid cremation, is the process of decomposing a human body using ultra-hot water and a strong base solution. Mainstream media claims there’s no human DNA, flesh or pathogens left after the big melt down, but then, who believes anything Big Food claims anymore. Remember, they’re the ones who say canola oil is “heart healthy” and fluoride in tap water is “good for building strong teeth.” Sure. This whistleblower coroner says this recycling of dead people into the food and water supply is happening in most U.S. states. Human bones are being ground up into powder and used as calcium phosphate for prescriptions that “treat” calcium deficiencies. If you still don’t believe this is happening, just ask Katrina Spade, the founder and CEO of Recompose, a company that uses this reduction process as an “urban, soil-based, ecologically friendly death-care option.” This is further covered in the feature film Biosludged . Who is already suffering from mad human disease, the human version of mad cow disease? Is that why dementia cases are on a sharp uptick? Combine that with millions of spike proteins lodging in the medulla oblongata and what have you got? People who believe the nightly TV news and are voting for a complete communist takeover -- that’s what. The billionaire psychopath globalists at the World Economic Forum and the Atlantic Council want everyone eating insects and lab-grown Franken-meat all day, and the only way humans would be dumb enough to succumb to this is if they were already going insane from cannibalism and mRNA clot shot syndrome. That’s why it is vital to eat organic food, filter your water, use natural medicine and read independent truth news. Otherwise, you might get in line with the sheeple in Kamala’s socialist bread lines and buy some Soylent Green that’s on sale now at every corporate food outlet in America.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-10-nebraska-greenlights-hearing-pro-abortion-ballot-initiative.html,Nebraska Supreme Court greenlights hearing of a pro-abortion ballot initiative,"On Sept. 5, pro-life advocates filed a brief with the Nebraska Supreme Court, alleging a pro-abortion ballot measure violates state law . This is in connection to the courts giving the green light to a constitutional challenge against the state's abortion expansion ballot initiative in August. The abortion expansion ballot measure proposes amending the Nebraska Constitution to prevent the state from protecting unborn babies from abortion until the point of fetal viability, or when the life and health of the mother is at stake. However, to legally appear on voters' ballots in November, the measure must address only a single subject. Thomas More Society attorneys argued in the brief that the ballot initiative contains "" remarkably misleading terms "" and is ""unconstitutionally riddled with separate subjects,"" in violation of the Nebraska Constitution's Single Subject Rule. The petition also seeks to roll back numerous popularly supported laws regulating abortion. The language of the proposed amendment would effectively repeal more than 50 years of laws the state has passed and have wide-reaching effects on many other fields of medicine, the conservative non-profit argued. The existing laws include the state's dismemberment abortion ban and the parental notification requirement for abortions on minors. Laws requiring physician involvement, physician availability for postoperative care, care of born-alive aborted infants, care of post-viability aborted infants and detailed informed consent requirements, will effectively be repealed if the abortion expansion ballot initiative is accepted by voters. The brief further argues that the abortion initiative opens the determination of viability to a large number of non-physician ""health care practitioners."" Under current Nebraska law, ""health care practitioners"" include not only physicians, but also psychiatrists, pharmacists, nurses of varying degrees, and many others. The pro-life advocates asked the state Supreme Court to hear their challenge to the law and they were granted only 15 minutes to state their case for why the ballot measure either satisfies or violates the criteria laid out in Nebraska state law. Meanwhile, Protect Our Rights, the lobbying group behind the ballot measure said that the ballot measure is needed to give Nebraska residents the power to control their bodies, health and future. On the other hand, Priests for Life stands with the Thomas More Society in this fight. ""We stand in strong support of the Thomas More Society, with whom we have worked closely for decades,"" said Priests for Life National Director Frank Pavone. ""If Nebraska's lawmakers and citizens were able to have an honest debate about abortion, this amendment would fail at the ballot box . But abortion advocates are never honest about what it is they are promoting – that is, the brutal death of an unborn child."" The organization added that abortion advocates have been able to lie about abortion for far too long. ""We can't let them continue to get away with it,"" it continued. States that outlawed abortion Abortion is one of the major talking points in the ongoing presidential election campaigns. Decisions as to who is going to be cast in the ballots are largely relative to where the state stands on this issue. Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to ""restore"" abortion rights federally while former President Donald Trump has said recently he will leave the issue to states. Some states are also voting in referendums specifically on abortion. (Related: Trump says he'll VOTE NO on Florida's pro-abortion amendment .) The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and rescinded the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022. That decision returned control over the procedure back to individual states. Some states have enacted total bans, while others protect the procedure throughout pregnancy. As of August, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions , banning the procedure at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier. Some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother. These states, including Texas, Florida and Alabama, are under Republican control with many clustered in the American South. Another eight states allow some access to the procedure. These states bar abortion sometime between 12 and 23 weeks of pregnancy. The other 25 states, plus the District of Columbia, protect abortion up until the point of fetal viability. Nine of these states, as well as D.C., go even further and do not restrict abortion based on gestational duration. Abortion bans cover both surgical and medication abortion, meaning healthcare providers in these states are prohibited from prescribing abortion pills. But in some cases, abortion medication has been used to circumvent these bans. Some medical professionals in abortion-friendly states have begun prescribing the pills and sending them by mail to patients in restrictive states. Abortion itself will be also on the ballot in several states. Eleven states, including Florida, Arizona, Maryland and Nebraska, have confirmed referendums on abortion access for November.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-billions-deficient-life-supporting-micronutrients-study.html,"Billions of people now deficient in critical life-supporting micronutrients, study finds","New research published in the Lancet Global Health journal reveals that more than half of the world's population is severely lacking in micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. An astounding 99.3 percent of the entire global population, including some wealthy one-percenters, is lacking in at least one vital nutrient the body needs for wellness, the paper explains. Researchers collected data from 31 countries and used methodology to extrapolate it as an estimate for micronutrient intake across 185 countries. They looked at 15 micronutrients in particular that are recognized as critical for human health. The team identified seven common micronutrients that people are most deficient in: calcium, iodine, vitamin E, iron, riboflavin (vitamin B2), vitamin C, and folate. In the United States, vitamin E, iodine, and vitamin C are among the most common micronutrient deficiencies. Throughout the world, children younger than five years old are generally lacking in iron, zinc, and / or vitamin A. ""Our study is a big step forward,"" commented Chris Free, a research professor and the study's lead co-author. ""Not only because it is the first to estimate inadequate micronutrient intakes for 34 age-sex groups in nearly every country, but also because it makes these methods and results easily accessible to researchers and practitioners."" Ty Beal, another lead author, called the findings ""alarming,"" adding that these major ""gaps"" in micronutrient levels are compromising public health and ""limit[ing] human potential on a global scale."" (Related: Be sure to check out our earlier report about the six essential macro- and micronutrients you need every day for optimal health.) Are you micronutrient deficient? Micronutrient deficiency can cause a variety of health problems depending on which micronutrients are missing. The following is a breakdown of the most common micronutrient deficiencies and what happens to the body as a result: 1) Iodine (68 percent): Vital for cognitive development in infants – pregnant and breastfeeding women especially should make sure they are getting enough iodine. 2) Vitamin E (67 percent): Muscle weakness and impaired coordination are common symptoms of vitamin E deficiency. 3) Calcium (66 percent): Without calcium, bones become brittle and weak. 4) Iron (65 percent): Iron deficiency is linked to anemia, which can damage the brain and cause a host of other problems. 5) Riboflavin (55 percent): Lack of vitamin B2 can cause eye sensitivity and neurological problems like seizures and migraines. 6) Folate (54 percent): Pregnant women need to take special care to optimize their folate levels, otherwise they risk stillbirth or bearing a child with severe birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. 7) Vitamin C (53 percent): Lack of vitamin C can cause gum bleeding, poor wound healing, and scurvy. Vitamin A and zinc are two other micronutrients that people are often lacking, though not as severely as those above. Vitamin A deficiency is linked to blindness while zinc deficiency spells disaster for immunity to disease. Women are more likely than men to be deficient in iodine, iron, and another critical mineral called selenium. Men, conversely, are generally more lacking in magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin (vitamin B1), and niacin (vitamin B3). ""Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, leading to impaired cognition and adverse pregnancy outcomes,"" the authors explain in their paper. ""Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness globally, affecting mostly children and pregnant women."" In the comments, someone added to the conversation that a lot of this was engineered to strip the human population of the ""fuel"" we all need for our bodies to work as they should. ""The U.S. has the worst food in the world,"" another added, referring to GMOs (genetically modified organisms), chemical preservatives, petroleum-based food colorings, and other toxic food additives that are banned in a lot of other countries but rampant throughout the U.S. food supply.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-christians-who-pushed-covid19-vaccines-should-repent.html,Christians who betrayed their faith and pushed abortion-tainted COVID-19 vaccines should repent for perpetuating mass murder,"Vaccines are widely regarded in the medical community as being synonymous with science. These biologics are so highly worshiped; their necessity and historical impact cannot be questioned – not by parents, healthcare providers, or the media. Parents who question vaccines are often dismissed from pediatric offices and denied healthcare for their children. Healthcare providers who question vaccines are often stripped of their license and/or fired from their position. Moreover, the media parrot’s vaccine industry propaganda, elevating vaccine “science” to an authoritarian orthodoxy that demands obedience and forever compliance. Many Evangelical Christians tend to fall in line with the vaccine narrative. During the implementation of communism in 2020, many Christian churches fearfully and cowardly closed their doors. Some churches eventually opened their doors back up, only to mass vaccinate their community with abortion-tainted vaccines . Christians must realize that vaccines are made from the most brutal, calculated types of abortion There is nothing scientific, nothing honorable about harvesting a child’s organs in utero to mass produce a biological product that comes with some grandiose promise of “immunization.” But this is exactly the history of vaccination: these biologics are developed from child sacrifice -- from strategic abortions that seek specific organs and tissues. Christians who learn about the history of vaccines should repent and begin rebuking this sordid industry. In order to obtain the organs and cell lines for mass production of vaccines, the most unethical forms of abortion are necessary. This is a cold reality for most people to fathom – especially Christians, who want to comply with authority and believe that everything will work out for God’s glory. During these strategic abortions, healthcare providers work to preserve the child’s biological functions in utero to meticulously harvest their organs and tissues so the body parts can be kept in the best condition possible. There’s nothing scientific, moral, or ethical about these organ harvesting procedures. A pro-life organization named CHOICE42 produced a video titled “ It’s OK. ” This video tells the true stories of women who are coerced to give their child up to the altar of science. The video shows how the babies are delivered live and then dissected on the operating table. The video tells all, how the organs are strategically harvested and how fetal cell lines are manufactured from these horrors, so that vaccines can be mass produced. The latest COVID-19 vaccines, for instance, were developed from the HEK-293 fetal cell line. The term fetal cell line is a fancy term that disguises the horrid trail of organ harvesting that takes place to procure the organs necessary for vaccine manufacture. These cell lines are predicated on the brutality of evacuating a baby from a mother and cutting that baby apart, limb by limb, tissue by tissue. One of the babies of the HEK-293 fetal cell line was dissected alive at Leiden University in the Netherlands in 1972. Under the direction of Dr. Alexander van der Eb, this little girl was slain after having her organs removed one by one. The little girl was not sedated before she was picked apart, because this would have disrupted her biological functions. Christians commonly support abortion and mass murder by pushing vaccines When Evangelicals shuttered their churches, reinforced fear in their communities, and converted their campuses to COVID-19 vaccination centers , they supported abortion and the brutality of child sacrifice, while perpetuating the mass injury and murder of the COVID-19 vaccines . Today, children are being injected with these products, and some are suffering and even dying from these shots, as the curse of vaccines continues to mar humanity. When Evangelicals pressured their brothers and sisters to get the COVID-19 vaccines because it’s “an act of love,” they gave their soul away, falling into the clutches of a false savior. When Evangelicals, motivated by fear and cowardice, segregated one another over an abortion-tainted product, they sold their soul to the devil. Yet, with so many chances to repent for misleading their congregants, most of these Evangelical churches and Christian societies continue to keep their mouths shut about the whole debacle. Prideful, many Christians will not confess or repent for obeying false authorities and falling for this deception. In this act of pride, many Christians have not only given away their conscience, dignity, and health, but also their faith.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-fda-authorizes-covid-vaccine-without-clinical-data.html,FDA authorizes yet another COVID “vaccine” – and once again WITHOUT clinical data to back it,"Novavax was just given the green light by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to start mass producing yet another new ""vaccine"" for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This latest jab is protein-based and targets the so-called JN.1 variant of the Chinese virus. Like the many others before it, Novavax's JN.1 injection was granted emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Though there is not a single human clinical trial to back the shot, the FDA says it must be allowed to hit the market immediately based on animal testing data that supposedly supports its use. ""Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization,"" announced Dr. Peter Marks, the guy in charge of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. (Related: Have you seen the proof that COVID ""vaccine"" shedding does, in fact, occur? This means the unvaccinated are at risk, too.) FDA also approves new mRNA injections from Moderna, Pfizer So as to not leave out the other major COVID jab players from raking in another windfall, the FDA also granted fresh EUA licenses to the latest modRNA (mRNA) injections from Pfizer and Moderna, which were granted just days prior to Novavax. The FDA apparently no longer requires human clinical trials to be conducted on the latest and greatest COVID jabs because the ""emergency"" is just too serious to bother with all that science stuff. ""The assertion rings hollow when FDA has not required manufacturers of the mRNA biological [products] to provide scientific evidence to the public that safety and effectiveness has been demonstrated,"" commented Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC). In support of his company's new injection, Novavax CEO John C. Jacobs issued a statement claiming that the shot shows ""robust cross-reactivity against JN.1 lineage viruses."" In case you have never heard of JN.1, it is the successor of KP.3, another alleged COVID variant that was circulating the last time Big Pharma needed another easy profit fix. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is doing its part to keep the variants coming, claiming credit for ""sequencing"" them every time the vaccine industry needs another excuse to create another high-dollar shot for easy money. The CDC claims that KP.3 closely resembles another strain of COVID called KP.3.1.1 that was supposedly responsible for four out of 10 new COVID cases in the two weeks ending on August 3. The CDC insists that KP.3.1.1 was the dominant COVID strain during the month of August. By making these declarations, the CDC communicated to both Pfizer and Moderna to churn out new injections of their own that supposedly target KP.3. The FDA had initially told Big Pharma to make new ""vaccines"" for JN.1, but later changed its recommendation to KP.3. The Novavax shot for JN.1 reportedly takes a lot longer to manufacture than Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA shots because it uses different technology. The FDA has told all of these companies to just go ahead and keep manufacturing whatever shots they have for whatever strains they chose to target because why not when there is money to be made? ""They already paralyzed and killed millions of people and somehow they're still trying to give people more shots!"" one upset commenter wrote. ""The individuals behind all this need to be held accountable for global mass murder,"" wrote another. ""They won't stop until everyone has been injected. That's how AI will be able to keep track of everyone. Revelation coming soon."" The last thing America needs right now is another COVID ""vaccine.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-fatality-rate-spikes-cardiac-inflammation-covid-vaccine.html,Fatality rate spikes to 9.6% for individuals diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis after taking the COVID vaccine,"A recent analysis of Japan's Adverse Drug Event Report database published in the Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy has uncovered a damning correlation between SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, severe heart conditions and a rising fatality rate from these serious vaccine injuries . Not only does the study link COVID-19 mRNA vaccines with rising rates of myocarditis and pericarditis, but it also shows that there is a staggering 9.6% fatality rate for these two conditions alone. Nearly 10% fatality rate detected from vaccine-induced myopericarditis in 64-day window The study analyzed 880,999 adverse event reports, of which 1,846 cases were identified as myocarditis and 761 as pericarditis. Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the surrounding tissue, are collectively referred to as myopericarditis. Disturbingly, the data demonstrates that these vaccines — specifically BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) — are directly responsible for a significant number of these cases. Furthermore, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) for myocarditis stands at a shocking 30.51, and for pericarditis, it's 21.99. The study further exposes that the majority of affected individuals are young men, aged 30 or younger. The onset of these serious adverse events typically occurs within eight days of vaccination, with the majority of those affected succumbing to myocarditis or pericarditis within just 64 days after vaccination. Notably, the study authors did not investigate outcomes beyond the 64-day post vaccination period and did not monitor progression of symptoms over time. This means that cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that did not resolve could have become worse over time, and the study did not pick up on it. This study is limited because it may ignore further complications past the 64-day post evaluation period, ignoring long term complications and possibly deaths caused by these long-term heart conditions. Study authors downplay severity of widespread heart damage and death from covid jabs Despite the severity of these findings, the study's authors chose to downplay the reality of mass injury and death from the vaccines, reporting that ""overall outcomes were good"" for most cases of myocarditis. This has drawn sharp criticism from experts, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a prominent cardiologist and author of over 1,000 scientific publications. McCullough has voiced concerns that the authors’ conclusions are dangerously misleading, given the high fatality rate associated with these vaccine-induced heart conditions and its implications for further harm. According to McCullough's analysis, out of 1,014 reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, 97 resulted in death, yielding a fatality rate of 9.6%. The study found that among 759 myocarditis cases, 84 (11%) were fatal, and among 255 pericarditis cases, 13 (5%) were fatal. This is unacceptable and warrants accountability. What should be done to the governments and medical authorities that coerced young people to submit to this harmful medical experiment? “This is an astronomical and clinically unacceptable fatality rate for a vaccine side effect, particularly among young, otherwise healthy men,” McCullough stated. He criticized the study’s conclusion that ""overall outcomes were good,"" arguing that such a conclusion is inappropriate when facing a 9.6% case fatality rate within a mere 64-day follow-up period. Moreover, the risk of heart damage with each booster dose has only exacerbated heart damage across populations. Another limitation of the study: it only looked at symptomatic myopericarditis cases that were reported to Japan's pharmacovigilance system. For one, medical authorities have generally disregarded vaccine injuries since the rollout of the COVID-19 jabs, so the number of reported cases of myocarditis are inevitably smaller than the actual amount. Two, the cases reported to Japan’s pharmacovigilance system focus on symptomatic myopericarditis within a short follow up period. McCullough points out that some cases of heart damage are actually asymptomatic, with runaway mRNA spike protein damage manifesting later as serious conditions like cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that causes the heart to struggle pumping blood to the rest of the body. According to McCullough, “These data are just the tip of the iceberg,” as prior studies suggest the risk of heart damage goes up roughly 2.5% with each successive booster and that half of myopericarditis cases may be sub-clinical.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-minor-girls-transphobic-lgbt-boys-locker-room.html,Minor girls labeled “transphobic” after speaking out against LGBT boys using their locker rooms,"Young girls who attend public school in Washoe County, Nev., which covers areas north of Carson City near Lake Tahoe, are under attack by the LGBT mafia for not wanting to change in locker rooms with boys and men who identify as ""transwomen."" Parents and students within the Washoe County School District are horrified that boys who want to be ""girls"" have invaded girls' locker rooms where they get to strip naked and watch real girls do the same. ""He also gets a front-row seat to view naked females,"" commented a grandmother whose granddaughter attends Spanish Springs High School. A student at the same school told the media that girls ""feel uncomfortable in locker rooms under any circumstances, but especially when they have to share the space with someone who is biologically different from them at birth."" ""A minor cannot have a sip of alcohol, that's good,"" another parent said in a public comment during a hearing about the scandal. ""But in Washoe County schools right now, a minor male can change in the locker room in front of minor females."" (Related: Remember when CVS went woke and told its employees to use whichever washroom or locker room ""that is appropriate to the gender they identify with?"") Washoe County Schools set up separate changing areas ... for girls, not transgenders On August 27, a meeting was held where students, parents, grandparents and anyone else in the area were free to speak their minds. The issue arose after school district trustees determined that trans-identifying males have a right to access female spaces under Administrative Regulation 5165, which allows anyone to use locker rooms that ""correspond to their gender identity."" ""Every parent should be notified that the male is invading the girls' locker room, irrespective of any law that permits,"" one angry parent yelled at the meeting. It gets worse. Washoe County Schools, in an attempt to quell all the controversy, decided to build new changing areas ... for the girls rather than the transgenders. However, any girl who actually uses these separate changing areas will basically end up slapping a giant scarlet T on their shirts that stands for transphobic . Since much of the staff at Washoe County Schools sounds like it supports the transgender invasion of girls' sports and locker rooms, using these alternative changing areas is likely to make girls feel ostracized by their LGBT-affirming superiors. ""I believe in my heart that telling girls to [undress] with a boy and making them feel like they are excluding somebody or discriminating by speaking up by saying they are uncomfortable – by doing that, you are teaching the children silence,"" one parent rightfully said. Such madness is spilling over into general society, too. Up in Washington state, for instance, Julie Jaman had a horrific experience at a YMCA in which she discovered a naked man showering alongside her in the next stall. ""While showering after my weekly swim, I heard a man's voice,"" Jaman wrote. ""Peering past the billowing curtain, I saw a biological man in a woman's swimsuit looking at two little girls. I was flabbergasted. My immediate reaction was instinctual and protective. I'm a mother of daughters."" ""Within seconds, a YMCA staff person appeared. I asked her to get him out. Without any inquiry, she immediately accused me of discrimination, banned me from the pool for the rest of my life, and?called the police.?Instead of protecting the little girls or trying to understand my concerns, I became the accused. I was the culprit."" It is truly a shame that children today cannot even go to school without having LGBT perversion constantly thrown in their face. Learn more at Transhumanism.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-podcasters-ordered-delete-episode-misgendered-trans-woman.html,German podcasters ordered to delete an episode where they “misgendered” a transwoman or pay a $276K fine,"A German podcast has been ordered by a regional court in Germany to either remove an episode or to pay a 250,000 euro ($277,000) fine after the show's hosts referred to a transgender woman as ""a man"" and repeatedly referred to the person using male pronouns. The podcast ""Hoss and Hopf,"" hosted by entrepreneurs and internet personalities Kiarash Hossainpour and Philip Hopf, spent some time discussing a trans woman identifying as Laura Holstein, previously known as Nicholas. Holstein gained attention recently for demanding access to female-only spaces, such as a female-only gym in Bavaria, with her attempts to intrude upon these spaces garnering support from Germany's federal Anti-Discrimination Agency . The regional court of the city of Frankfurt claimed that the ""misgendering"" was a violation of Holstein's rights , and sentenced the podcast hosts to either delete the podcast episode or face a fine of up to 250,000 euros for non-compliance . The podcast episode has since been deleted. (Related: Popular French author faces criminal charges for “misgendering” a male mayor with gender dysphoria by calling him “a man” – which he IS .) Furthermore, both Hossainpour and Hopf were forbidden from referring to Holstein as a man ever again. Hossainpour decries Germany's censorship Hossainpour took to X to comment on the issue, posting the court order that forbids the podcast hosts from ""distributing, publishing or having third parties distribute or publish"" statements that mention Holstein as a man. ""Our podcast episode about the legal drama of a person who was born biologically male but wanted to go to a women's gym – with the support of the Independent Federal Commissioner for Anti-Discrimination – is now offline,"" Hossainpour said. ""The reason? A decision by the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court that redefines the boundaries between biology, identity and law."" ""In an expedited procedure, without an oral hearing, the court ruled in favor of the applicant, a transgender woman. Why? Our repeated designation as a 'man' was considered a violation of her personal rights, since she is 'legally and socially recognized as a woman,'"" Hossainpour added. Hossainpour also denounced the court's urgency in running the case, emphasizing how the court believed that the use of biologically correct terms represented an ""immediate danger that could not be delayed."" ""It is remarkable that the court saw an 'extraordinary urgency' here – as if the use of biologically correct terms represented an immediate danger that could not be delayed,"" Hossainpour wrote regarding the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court's ruling that became a viral post on X. ""One inevitably wonders whether other, perhaps actually urgent cases had to take a back seat."" ""This creates a fascinating dilemma: in Germany, a person born biologically male, who is legally considered a woman, can no longer be referred to as a man,"" Hossainpour added. ""An expression of opinion that the court classifies as a violation of personal rights and even as an attack on human dignity and sanctions in fast-track proceedings.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-wef-finally-tells-the-truth-about-covid.html,World Economic Forum finally tells the truth about COVID: It was a ‘test’ of our obedience to rapidly forming new world order,"I have long said that Covid 19 was launched by design by a small number of people in the globalist predator class for one reason and one reason only — as a beta test for the coming technocratic new world order. (Article republished from LeoHohmann.Substack.com ) Now, we’ve got the World Economic Forum coming out and all but admitting that was exactly why the Covid-19 “pandemic” had to happen. The WEF gleefully posted the following snippet to the “My Carbon” page of its website where they make a pitch for so-called smart cities, which is just another term for 15-minute cities. The first of three “developments” that the WEF says must be in place before the world can evolve into its utopian vision of “smart and sustainable cities,” is compliance with restrictions on our freedom. It writes: 1. COVID-19 was the test of social responsibility – A huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were adopted by billions of citizens across the world. There were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility. They were testing us. That’s what Covid was all about. They wanted to see how many of us would give up our individual freedom and individual sovereignty by complying with a “new normal” that consisted of restrictions bordering on the absurd. Why, for instance was it “safe” to shop at Lowe’s or Home Depot but unsafe to shop at a small business or attend church? Why was it OK to go to strip clubs in Michigan but you couldn’t buy seeds for a garden? What the WEF is implying with its above statement is that in order to be “sustainable,” people and societies will need to be compliant with a new more authoritarian global order. Don’t ask questions. Don’t resort to logic. Just obey. Would we be obedient in the face of idiotic new laws and regulations, like wearing face diapers to stop what was said to be an aerosolized virus, and standing six feet apart in public, and submitting to a never-before-used, unlicensed mRNA gene-based injection? They said it was good for you, so roll up your sleeve. Don’t ask questions. If you did, you could lose your job and be treated as a societal outcast. Many people lost friends or even close family members to this monstrous “test” of our willingness to unquestioningly do what we’re told. Nearly five years later, arguably the most powerful nonprofit public-private partnership in the world, the WEF, admits it was all a test of our wills and celebrates the fact that most of us failed the test (or passed with flying colors depending how you look at it). They wanted to find out how many of us would prove our servitude to the lawless, fascistic beast system by complying with “unimaginable restrictions,” many of which were created out of thin air with absolutely no scientific evidence to back them up as contributing anything to public health.

Tim Walz , Kamala Harris' running mate, for fraudulent use of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) relief funds. The House panel subpoenaed Walz in demand of documents related to the Minnesota Department of Education's (MDE) management – or rather mismanagement – of money intended to fund federal child nutrition programs (FCNP). At issue is the spending habits of Feeding Our Future (FOF), a Muslim-run Minnesota nonprofit organization accused of thieving $250 million intended for hunger relief efforts during the ""pandemic."" Commenting on what has been uncovered so far, the Department of Justice (DOJ) described the scheme as a type of exploitation whereby children in need of food were deprived of it so thieves could siphon the cash into their own bank accounts – and all under Tim Walz's watch. ""As the chief executive and the highest ranking official in the state of Minnesota, you are responsible for the MDE and its administration of FCNPs,"" wrote Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) in a strongly worded letter to Walz.

The OLA called the MDE's oversight ""inadequate"" and rife with opportunities for fraud. Government officials are also subpoenaing MDE Commissioner Willie Jett, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Inspector General Phyllis Fong as part of the investigation. These three have until September 18 to comply with the subpoenas. Many are skeptical that the GOP will actually follow through in holding Walz and other corrupt government officials accountable for their crimes in all this. As usual, there is a strongly worded letter followed by not much else , though we will give them the benefit of the doubt as this investigation is still ongoing. ""So much for his administration being the administration of the free lunch for all that he publicized,"" someone named ""Nonna"" (@Nonna3311461081) commented on X about Walz's empty promises. Another wrote that in 2022 when this was all taking place, the Minnesota Department of Education's hands were tied by a court order for it to resume food program payments despite concerns raised by the state. ""The FBI told the state to continue reimbursements while they investigated,"" this same person added, claiming that ""this is a partisan fishing expedition"" and not much else. Others could not help but notice that similar things are happening in Fulton County, Ga., with Fani Willis, who we have been reporting on for voter fraud ever since the 2020 election. ""And don't forget to investigate all those Congress people who took PPP loans,"" suggested another about how a full-scale investigation into all of government, both left and right, is needed to root out the criminal traitors.

An unearthed FBI report from 2023 contains screenshots from Gray's banned Discord account showing that he was extremely frustrated about so-called ""trans issues"" before eventually deciding that the only course of action was to go on a shooting rampage at his school. Not only that, but Gray's father told police that his son belongs to the LGBTQ+ community. ""It was very difficult for him to go to school and not get picked on,"" said Colin Gray, 54, about Colt's experience at Apalachee High School. ""It went from one thing to another ... I was trying to get him on the golf team ... [they were, like], 'Oh, look, Colt's gay. He's dating that guy.' They just ridiculed him day after day after day."" Like his son, Colin faces charges associated with the shooting, including several counts of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder because he purchased the weapon used in the killings as a Christmas present for his son last December. (Related: Did you know that an evangelical Christian school teacher in Ireland was just arrested for refusing to address a male student using ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns?) Colt's stated contribution to ""culture"" was to end his life Last year when the younger Gray was just 13, the local sheriff's office received a tip from the FBI that Colt ""had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow,"" that threat having been made on the now-deleted Discord platform. ""im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years,"" Colt allegedly wrote on Discord. ""I cant kill myself yet, cause I'm not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did."" In other words, Colt apparently felt his life was worth so little that he planned to contribute to society by ending it, along with ending the lives of others from his high school. Colt was apparently communicating with someone else on Discord who was in agreement with the plan, writing the words ""I'm ready"" in response to Colt's above text along with a photograph of two guns. Colt and the other person were reportedly upset about ""the acceptance of transgender people"" in society, meaning they feel as though there is not enough of it. When Colin spoke to police back in 2023 about his son, he revealed that there was a recent separation from Colt's mother. Colin revealed that Colt's mother ""took his younger two"" children away from him, leaving just Colt behind who at the time was attending Jefferson Middle School. According to Colin, Colt ""gets flustered under pressure"" and ""doesn't really think straight"" when that happens. At the time when Colin gave Colt the gun for Christmas, Colin says he was trying to teach Colt about weapons and encourage him to do more things outdoors to ""get him away from those video games."" Colin showed police officers a photo of Colt with blood on his face from shooting a deer. Colin described it as the ""best day ever"" that he got to spend with Colt. ""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,"" Colin said, adding that his son talked about school shootings ""quite a bit.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-sabine-hazan-gut-bacteria-erased-by-covid-vaccines.html,Dr. Sabine Hazan reveals that important gut bacteria are ERASED by COVID “vaccines”,"Gastroenterologist Dr. Sabine Hazan took a closer look at the gut microbiomes of doctors who got ""vaccinated"" for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) before comparing their composition to that of doctors who skipped the shots. What Dr. Hazan found is that COVID jabs kill off important gun bacteria like bifidobacteria that are essential for strong immunity. Instead of boosting one's immune system like government authorities and the media are still claiming, COVID jabs destroy the probiotic bacteria that the body relies on to process nutrients, neutralize toxins and promote strong immunity. ""I started noticing a month later, the bifidobacteria, this important microbe, is dropping in patients pre- and post-vaccinations,"" Dr. Hazan commented. ""Only a certain group of microbes are getting killed ... Bifidobacteria is a huge part of immunity ... I think [the vaccine] is creating a bacteriophage or bifidophage."" A bacteriophage or bifidophage is a type of virus that infects a person and starts replicating within their microbiome. Dr. Hazan found that bifidobacteria destruction appears almost immediately post-injection. At around the 90-day mark, the fully jabbed person's entire bifidobacteria population drops to zero. ""There was a persistence in the damage, not only [after] 90 days but six months, nine months later,"" she says. ""That was the thing that started to make me panic."" (Related: Dr. Hazan says she is considering suing Facebook over the social media platform's mistreatment of her during the Wuhan coronavirus [COVID-19] ""pandemic"" – she was only trying to help people survive rather than die from the ""virus."") Vaccinated mothers pass microbiome destruction to newborn children Another really disturbing thing that Dr. Hazan discovered is that pregnant women who get jabbed for COVID end up passing on the same damage and destruction to their newborn babies. ""As we were looking at the microbiome of newborns [of] mothers who were breastfeeding, we started noticing that there's no bifidobacteria in those newborns,"" she explains. ""Newborns are supposed to have a ton of bifidobacteria ... 90 percent of the microbiome of babies is bifidobacteria."" Keep in mind that one of the hallmarks of bifidobacteria loss in children is autism and autism spectrum disorders. This once again suggests that vaccines, in this case those for COVID, destroy probiotic bacteria and trigger autism in children. IS THE SPIKE KILLING GUT BACTERIA? Babies that were Born from COVID Vaccinated Mothers who were Breastfeeding had Zero Bifidobacteria. Is the Spike Protein Killing Gut Bacteria and causing Autism in those Babies? - Dr. Sabine Hazan @SabinehazanMD pic.twitter.com/RRtrWzu6d1 — Asher Press (@AsherPress) June 2, 2023 Dr. Hazan continued her research by collecting stool samples from her test patients. She observed that patients with extreme COVID symptoms had certain bacteria missing from their gut. Once again, the bacteria are none other than bifidobacteria. All that talk about the benefits of ivermectin for treating COVID are further confirmed by another amazing discovery by Dr. Hazan. She observed that taking ivermectin helps to repopulate the gut with bifidobacteria in 24 hours or less. You may not know this but ivermectin is a fermented product with a biological construct similar to that of bifidobacteria and common probiotic supplements. According to Dr. Hazan, ivermectin belongs to the same group of microbes as bifidobacteria – you can think of it like brothers and sisters in the microbiome world. This would explain why many are seeing incredible success overcoming COVID- and COVID jab-related health problems by taking ivermectin. It also explains why the establishment remains hellbent on keeping the public in the dark about ivermectin, as well as keeping it as inaccessible and unaffordable as possible.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-quackery-nytimes-lizard-venom-peptides-prevent-covid-deaths.html,QUACKERY: NY Times says injecting yourself with lizard venom peptides can prevent COVID deaths,"The media is abuzz with new claims that the popular obesity drug Wegovy is helping fat people to avoid death from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Like other GLP-1 drugs, Wegovy is synthesized from venom peptides of the Gila Monster reptile creature. As Business Insider reports , ""It all started back in the early 1990s , when government researcher Dr. John Eng discovered that Gila monsters have a special hormone in their venom."" This led to GLP-1 drugs being based on the venom peptides produced by the Gila Monster. ""We wouldn't have [GLP-1 drugs] without Gila monsters — their hunger-regulating venom inspired weight-loss drugs,"" says Business Insider. The New York Times ran a piece claiming that a large clinical trial found that people who injected themselves with lizard venom peptides during the ""pandemic"" are less likely than others to die from a COVID infection. According to the report, the Wegovy patients still tested ""positive"" for COVID at the same rate as non-patients taking a placebo. However, the death rate in the Wegovy group was 33 percent less than the placebo group, and for reasons that the Times says ""are not clear."" More than likely, it was a mere coincidence that the sample groups showed a disparity based on their usage or non-usage of Wegovy. What would lizard venom peptides have to do with a COVID infection anyway? Whatever the case may be, the Times wants its readers to know that taking Wegovy may prolong one's lifespan in the event that he or she tests positive for COVID. Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, wrote an editorial about the finding in which he called it ""stunning."" The paper in question was published in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology . (Related: Have you checked out our report about how Ozempic and Wegovy can trigger a devastating wave of organ failure in some patients? The damage, as you might expect, closely resembles the symptoms of snake bites .) It's probably just coincidence The study was not designed to look at the effects of Wegovy on people who test positive for COVID, by the way. It also did not determine that people who take Wegovy are any healthier than their non-user counterparts. ""It is a randomized trial and the infection rates were similar, so this represents top-notch evidence,"" claims Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University and editor-in-chief of the journal in which the study was published. When asked if he thinks Wegovy is having any direct effect on COVID infections, Dr. Benjamin Scirica, a trial investigator, cardiologist and senior physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital said that neither he nor his team members ever anticipated that there would be a drug effect. The trial, sponsored by Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk, was already underway when COVID struck out of nowhere. The actual goal of the research was to see whether the weight-loss drug prevents deaths from heart disease and heart attacks. In the process, researchers made a much different discovery that piqued the interest of the Times in tying Wegovy to reduced COVID deaths. The problem is that those who participated in the trial were already at higher risk of dying or becoming very seriously ill from COVID because of obesity and heart disease. Keep in mind that most people who take Wegovy are fat and more than likely sick. The reason they opted for the drug was to shed all that weight and regain some kind of normalcy in their lives. ""We had to make dramatic changes to make sure the study would continue and that the subjects would continue to get their medications,"" Dr. Scirica said about the complications that arose due to the ""pandemic."" The research may have also been skewed by the new ""touchless"" protocols that were introduced mid-study to keep investigators away from patients. ""Most of our studies in the cardiovascular world – with statins or other cardiovascular drugs – have a pretty good effect on cardiovascular deaths but don't affect non-cardiovascular deaths,"" Dr. Scirica added.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-anti-inflammatory-diet-helps-with-cardiometabolic-diseases.html,"Anti-inflammatory diet helps with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cuts dementia risk by 31%","Adhering to an anti-inflammatory diet could reduce the risk of developing dementia by 31 percent . A recent study published in JAMA Open Network found that anti-inflammatory dietary choices can influence brain health into old age, particularly for individuals with existing cardiometabolic diseases. Anti-inflammatory foods help with cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, reducing dementia risk The current study examined over 80,000 adults aged 60 and older, utilizing data from the UK Biobank. Participants were monitored for up to 15 years, with a median follow-up period of 12.4 years. The research specifically focused on individuals with cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), such as heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and stroke, which are known to increase dementia risk. Individuals with CMDs who followed an anti-inflammatory diet experienced a significant 31 percent reduction in dementia risk. This suggests that dietary modifications could play a crucial role in managing dementia risk , especially for those already vulnerable due to other health conditions. Dementia, characterized by a decline in memory and cognitive function, is often associated with damage to brain cells. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. Previous research has established a connection between diet and dementia risk, with certain dietary patterns potentially slowing Alzheimer’s progression. Cardiometabolic diseases are known to heighten the risk of dementia. Inflammation can stifle blood flow to the brain, cutting off oxygen and important nutrients, thereby starving the brain. Abigail Dove, the lead author of the study, pointed out that CMDs such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease are indicators of inflammation and both inflammatory conditions individually increase dementia risk by 1.5 to 2 times. This risk is compounded when individuals have multiple CMDs. The study suggests that anti-inflammatory diets significantly mitigate the risk by reducing systemic inflammation within the cardiovascular system, which is common in individuals with CMDs. Dove explains that inflammation can accelerate brain cell damage, leading to cognitive decline. For instance, CMDs like diabetes and heart disease can disrupt blood flow to the brain and damage brain cells, contributing to the development of dementia. Dove said that Type 2 diabetes exhausts the normal functions of the brain. “When excess sugar from the blood enters the brain, it can break down the protective coating that surrounds brain cells, making them less efficient and more vulnerable to damage,” Dove said, “Stroke occurs when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, essentially suffocating brain cells and leaving severely damaged tissue behind.” Anti-inflammatory foods should form the basis of government dietary guidelines For individuals interested in adopting an anti-inflammatory diet , Dove and other experts recommend including foods such as berries, nuts, fatty fish, avocados, green tea, olive oil, vegetables, turmeric and mushrooms. Conversely, reducing intake of sugar, refined carbohydrates, fried foods and alcohol may also help manage inflammation. In the study, researchers assessed participants' diets using a detailed questionnaire, analyzing 206 foods and 32 drinks. Instead of focusing solely on specific foods, the study evaluated the inflammatory impact of nutrients and used this data to calculate an overall inflammation score for each diet. Participants were divided into three groups based on their diet’s inflammatory impact: anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory and neutral. MRI scans were used to measure brain volume, revealing that lower systemic inflammation was associated with healthier brain markers and reduced dementia risk. The inflammatory diet was associated with neurodegeneration, loss of volume in the hippocampus region of the brain, which is responsible for memory processing. Anti-inflammatory foods like fish, nuts, roots vegetables, berries, herbs and mushrooms improved cardiometabolic diseases; whereas, sugary foods, fried foods and refined carbohydrates worsened these health conditions. Studies like these can help pave the way for new dietary guidelines. The USDA food pyramid desperately needs an overhaul. Instead of including 12 servings of bread, cereal and pasta, it should include things like spirulina , beet root, turmeric, hawthorn berry , pomegranate, blueberries, lion's mane mushroom , cinnamon and many other nutrient-dense foods. Anti-inflammatory foods should provide the basis of any diet, for longevity and healthy cardiovascular and brain function into old age.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-fda-grants-novavax-eua-without-clinical-trial-data.html,FDA grants emergency use authorization for updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine even without clinical trial data,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine despite the lack of clinical trial data. According to the FDA, the updated and protein-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is specifically designed to target the omicron variant JN.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 . The updated vaccine is produced using a similar process to earlier Novavax formulas and individuals receiving it may experience side effects similar to those reported with previous versions. This EUA applies to individuals aged 12 and older, with the updated vaccine featuring a monovalent component that aligns with the omicron JN.1 variant. Those who have never been vaccinated can receive two doses approximately three weeks apart, while previously vaccinated individuals can get a single booster dose. Meanwhile, the previous Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023-2024 Formula), will no longer be authorized for use. ""The COVID-19 vaccines have had a tremendous positive impact on public health, and vaccination continues to be the most effective method for COVID-19 prevention. COVID-19 remains a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine when eligible,"" claimed Peter Marks, the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. ""Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization."" (Related: FDA warns of CARDIAC INFLAMMATION risk linked to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine .) In line with this, the updated vaccine will soon be available after the Maryland-based company's product receives regulatory clearance. However, Barbara Loe Fisher, the co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, argued that the FDA should not claim safety and effectiveness in the absence of clinical trial data. ""The assertion rings hollow when the FDA has not required manufacturers of the mRNA biological [products] to provide scientific evidence to the public that safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated,"" Fisher stated. FDA: Novavax COVID-19 vaccine linked to cardiac inflammation risk and other side effects The original version of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine was not safe either. In fact, the FDA linked the vaccine to cardiac inflammation risk . In June, 2022, the agency released documents that revealed four cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, which occurred during clinical trials of the vaccine among 30,000 participants from December 2020 to September 2021. ""These events raise the concern for a causal association with this vaccine, similar to the association documents with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Post-marketing data from individuals receiving mRNA vaccines [has] demonstrated increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within seven days following the second primary dose,"" the FDA noted. ""Data from passive surveillance during post-authorization use in other countries also indicate a higher than expected rate of myocarditis and pericarditis … associated with the vaccine. Further evaluation is needed to inform the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, and their outcomes, as additional data emerge over time."" The FDA also cited other side effects associated with the Novavax vaccine, including tenderness at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, hypersensitivity and swelling of the lymph nodes. One case of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder known to be associated with other COVID-19 vaccines, was also reported during the clinical trials.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-global-catastrophe-self-replicating-mrna-covid-vaccine.html,Dr. Daniel Nagase warns of possible GLOBAL CATASTROPHE as Japan plans to roll out world’s first self-replicating mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,"NHK , Japan's biggest broadcaster, aired a special report on Wednesday, Sept. 4, about the side effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines – featuring stories from viewers who shared their negative experiences. But according to Dr. Daniel Nagase, the issues seen so far might pale in comparison to what could happen with a new kind of vaccine known as the replicon vaccine . He warned that these vaccines could trigger a global catastrophe. Nagase said if genes from these replicon vaccines escape into the environment – through birds, insects or other animals – they could spread uncontrollably, creating a nightmare scenario. (Related: GLOBAL EMERGENCY UNFOLDING: Japan will unleash Bill Gates-approved, SELF-REPLICATING mRNA vaccines starting next month .) Replicon vaccines use a special type of RNA that can replicate itself. This means the vaccine could produce viral proteins inside the body longer. While this has excited researchers for its supposed potential in treating diseases, like cancer, it raises concerns about the vaccine's ability to spread between humans and other species. In November 2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved its first replicon vaccine , the ARCT-154. Developed by American biotech firm Arcturus Therapeutics in partnership with Australian vaccine manufacturer CSL Seqirus, this experimental COVID-19 vaccine is designed to be more efficient than traditional mRNA vaccines by setting up a ""biological factory"" in the body and producing more proteins with a similar dose. Japan plans to roll out these vaccines in late 2024, but protests have already erupted over the rollout due to concerns regarding the World Health Organization's proposed pandemic treaty and the risks posed by these new vaccine technologies. Nagase believes this is a global issue that everyone needs to watch closely. Global threat of replicon vaccines Replicon vaccines, also known as self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, carry a unique risk due to their viral origins . These vaccines are based on alphaviruses – a family of viruses that can infect both humans and animals . What makes them concerning is their resilience – some can survive for long periods outside of a host and remain infectious. The potential danger lies in how these man-made genes could spread – not just between people but across entire ecosystems. Nagase raised alarms about the serious consequences of introducing these artificial genes into the environment. He points out that if these genes were to escape into nature – via mosquitoes or other animals – they could spread uncontrollably, making it nearly impossible to eliminate them. The real feeling is that replicon vaccines could recombine with other viruses – leading to the creation of hybrid viruses, or ""superviruses,"" that are more dangerous and harder to control . One of the biggest concerns is interspecies transmission. Alphaviruses are known to jump between species and if a human injected with a replicon vaccine passes the artificial genes to animals or insects, the virus could survive and evolve in these new hosts. This means the virus could remain deadly to humans while thriving in other species – creating long-lasting reservoirs of infection. In the worst-case scenario, these genes could spread globally – making containment nearly impossible. The ARCT-154 trials in Vietnam , where over 9,000 people were given replicon vaccines, didn't address the potential environmental spread of the vaccine. There was no follow-up to check if the vaccine’s genetic material had entered the ecosystem. If a similar situation were to unfold on a larger scale – like in Japan – Nagase said the only solution might be a complete quarantine of the country. Without drastic measures, the artificial genes could spread across the world , becoming a permanent fixture in multiple species and posing an ongoing threat to human health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-ai-tool-to-target-vaccine-skeptics-social-media.html,UPenn researchers developing taxpayer-funded AI tool to target vaccine skeptics in social media,"University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) researchers are using U.S. taxpayer dollars to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to target social media users who are posting negative things about the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. This information came from grant documents obtained by Children's Health Defense (CHD) via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is funding this $4 million effort through the National Cancer Institute. (Related: HHS deploys AI robots to ""inoculate"" social media users against HPV vaccine ""misinformation."" ) Associate Professor of Nursing at UPenn Melanie L. Kornides heads the team behind the study . Kornides ""specializes"" in researching vaccine uptake and anti-misinformation strategies, while others participating in this project are software developers, machine learning and communication experts, and social media analysts. Their task is to scour YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for user data and create an ""inoculation tool"" to pinpoint ""HPV vaccine misinformation"" as well as content expressing vaccine skepticism – ""whether or not the information in the post is true or false."" Mary Holland, co-author of ""The HPV Vaccine on Trial: Seeking Justice for a Generation Betrayed,"" told the Defender that the UPenn research on the part of the public health industry is ""a sign of weakness."" ""When you are censoring information, labeling it misinformation and smearing us, this is a sign that they've lost the science and are now in a verbal food fight. It's just a sign they are going to lose,"" she said. Parents are likely to refuse HPV vaccination for their children The grant is one of more than 50 grants totaling more than $40 million awarded by the HHS last year to universities, healthcare systems and departments of public health to increase HPV vaccine uptake. Nearly half of parents have heard stories of harm from HPV vaccination , according to the grant documents, and those parents are more likely to refuse vaccination for their children. ""Fueled by misinformation from the anti-vaccine movement through social media, parents' concerns about side effects and safety may foster reluctance to vaccinate their children,"" the documents said. In response, the researchers said they are training AI to identify misinformation using methods from Kornides' previous work identifying HPV vaccine misinformation on X, formerly Twitter. In that study, Kornides and colleagues identified tweets about the HPV vaccine using keywords and coded them for their misinformation content. Overall, tweets that were deemed ""misinformation"" raised the following concerns: the vaccine was ineffective, unsafe or caused serious adverse events; there was inadequate or falsified safety monitoring; the pharmaceutical industry was profiteering; the government conspired with interested actors to support their profiting; children were too young for the vaccine; mandates were unjust; and there were issues with vaccines in general. ""This just proves yet again that anything that deviates from the orthodoxy in public health is considered misinformation,"" Holland said. ""Truth is irrelevant. That's shocking and disturbing. And it can kill you, period. That's the bottom line."" Merck, the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine, is facing over 200 lawsuits in federal court from people who suffered a range of serious injuries after taking Gardasil, including autoimmune disorders, premature ovarian failure and cancer.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-maintain-optimal-brain-performance-people-over-60.html,3 Effective ways to maintain optimal brain performance for people over 60,"Research shows that staying physically active has a big impact on brain health – even for people over 60 . From sharper memory to better problem-solving skills, the advantages of regular exercise are clear. However, many older adults don’t participate in physical activities that are tailored to their needs. Low motivation and limited access to suitable exercises are common barriers. Often, caregivers resort to repetitive, low-impact activities, like gentle stretching, walking or yoga, due to seniors’ declining cognitive and physical abilities. While these activities are helpful, there's a growing understanding that combining various types of exercises offers greater benefits. (Related: How to keep your brain healthy and sharp as you age .) Researchers are exploring effective ways to enhance both the cognitive and physical abilities of older adults. The most promising strategies include three main components: Engage in complex physical activities Physical exercise is essential not just for the body but also for the brain – particularly as people age. For seniors, staying active through aerobic exercises, like cycling, swimming or walking, can lead to significant cognitive benefits. These activities improve blood flow to the brain, encourage the growth of new neurons and enhance attention and memory. Moderate cardio workouts are especially beneficial because they improve overall cardiovascular health, which, in turn, increases oxygen flow to the brain. This enhanced oxygen supply helps generate new neurons in the hippocampus, a crucial area for memory. To maximize these benefits, exercise routines should combine cardio with balance, coordination, flexibility and strength training. Activities that require complex motor skills and coordination are particularly effective in boosting cognitive functions , such as attention, memory and mental flexibility. Combine physical activity with cognitive stimulation Pairing physical exercise with cognitive challenges can greatly enhance brain health. Engaging the brain during workouts, such as by planning a move or remembering a sequence of steps, helps keep cognitive skills sharp. This combination of mental and physical exercise can produce synergistic effects – improving overall cognitive function more than either type of activity alone. The brain functions as the control center for all bodily movements, relying on cognitive abilities like adaptability, concentration, learning and reasoning. These skills help people interact with their environment and maintain a good quality of life. Contrary to common belief, the brain does not continuously deteriorate with age. While some decline is natural after people turn 45, the brain retains its ability to adapt and form new connections – known as cerebral plasticity – throughout life. A stimulating lifestyle can help build a cognitive reserve that mitigates the effects of aging. Activities, such as brain games and puzzles can also be effective as they help improve concentration, focus and memory and make people more alert in daily activities. Although they may not prevent cognitive decline, they can slow it down. It is crucial to keep these games challenging and varied to avoid the mind slipping into ""autopilot."" Additionally, changing up daily routines or learning new skills can further challenge the brain – keeping both the logical left side and the creative right side engaged. Participate in group activities that lead to social interaction Social interaction is another crucial component for maintaining cognitive health in seniors. Engaging in group activities, such as going on outings, joining clubs or volunteering, can help combat loneliness and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression. Social activities also provide intellectual stimulation and opportunities for new learning experiences – contributing to better brain fitness. Working out in groups, especially through cooperative and competitive sports, like basketball or handball, offers both cognitive and physical benefits. These sports challenge balance, cardiovascular endurance, coordination, flexibility and strength. They also create dynamic, ever-changing situations that require adaptability and quick thinking – promoting cognitive engagement and resilience. Recent studies have shown that team sports can improve memory and planning skills in older adults – making them an excellent choice for maintaining cognitive health. Another innovative approach is using ""exergames"" – video games that combine physical activity with cognitive tasks, These games, which became popular with consoles, like the Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii and Switch, encourage players to move while engaging in activities that require balance, offer an even more immersive experience by combining real and virtual elements – providing high physical and cognitive stimulation. Studies suggest that these interactive games may be more effective at improving cognitive abilities than traditional exercises. A study published in GeroScienc e explored the impact of this advanced type of exergame . The study compared an immersive wall exergame program to a traditional muscle strengthening and walking routine – finding that the exergame might offer superior cognitive benefits for seniors. The unique features of these new-generation exergames, such as their complex motor tasks, immersive environments, intense physical demands, opportunities for social interaction and virtual cognitive challenges, make them an exciting multi-dimensional training option for older adults. These qualities suggest that Interactive Wall Exergames could be particularly effective in enhancing both cognitive and physical health – providing a comprehensive and fun way to stay active. By combining real-world physical movement with digital gameplay, these games challenge players to think on their feet – improving mental agility and motor skills enjoyably. This multi-domain approach to training not only keeps seniors physically fit but also mentally sharp – offering a holistic way to combat age-related cognitive decline .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-rogan-rips-mainstream-media-for-failure.html,"Rogan rips mainstream media for failure to cover ‘real numbers’ of people injured, killed by COVID shots","In his latest podcast, Joe Rogan called out the mainstream media for failing to report on the injuries and deaths linked to COVID-19 vaccines. (Article by Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) Rogan didn’t hold back from using strong language to make his point to viewers of Wednesday’s episode of “ The Joe Rogan Experience .” He said: “We don’t even know what the real numbers are because it’s not something the mainstream media covers — probably because they’ve all been vaccinated and they’re probably freaking the f*%# out.” Rogan’s guest, Bret Weinstein, Ph.D. , also called out the pharmaceutical industry and its governmental regulators for generating wealth for themselves at the expense of children’s health. It’s hard for “kind, intelligent” people to imagine that there are people who “are willing to profit off of injecting babies with things that may very well f*$% them up for the rest of their life,” Rogan told Weinstein. Most people think “there’s no way anyone’s that evil,” Rogan said. “Then when you start looking into the evidence.” He added, “You read ‘Turtles All The Way Down’ or ‘Dissolving Illusions’ and it’s just like wait, wait, wait.” “ Turtles All The Way Down : Vaccine Science and Myth” was edited by Children’s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland and Publishing Coordinator Zoey O’Toole. “ Dissolving Illusions : Diseases, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History” is by Dr. Suzanne Humphries . People injured by COVID shot who spoke out were attacked Weinstein, co-host of the “ The DarkHorse Podcast ,” and Rogan debunked the myth that vaccines are responsible for saving people’s lives, historically and in the present. They discussed why mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 shots, are harmful to human health and how problematic it is that Big Pharma continues to push vaccines. Rogan recalled how people like musician Eric Clapton , who was injured by the COVID-19 vaccine, were attacked when they spoke out about their experience. Clapton was called “the most hurtful of words,” Rogan recalled. Weinstein said he thinks the terrible treatment of those injured by the COVID-19 vaccines was a way to gaslight them. “The gaslighting of the [vaccine] injured is insane,” Weinstein said. “How is it that someone who suffers an adverse event is not entitled to our compassion?” Weinstein: mRNA vaccine platform is Big Pharma’s ‘cash cow’ Rogan and Weinstein explained why they think the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded as it did. In Weinstein’s view, the pharmaceutical industry needed a public health emergency that would legitimize and normalize using mRNA vaccine technology — which Weinstein considers to be very dangerous — on the general population. “Their real goal,” Weinstein told Rogan, “was to normalize the use of a gene therapy on a population that had never had that idea placed in its mind.” They called the new gene therapy a “vaccine” since most people believed vaccines were historically beneficial and thus could be trusted.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-blueberries-miracle-medicine-heart-health-brain-function.html,Blueberries: Nature’s MIRACLE MEDICINE for optimal heart health and brain function,"Blueberries seem like just another popular fruit, but they're a powerhouse of antioxidants and phytonutrients that can do wonders for your body and mind. These tiny blue superfruits are more than just a sweet snack. Adding a handful of these berries to your diet could be one of the simplest, most delicious ways to enhance your health and prolong your lifespan. Blueberries are packed with important vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. They are a good source of vitamins like vitamins A, B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folate), C, E and K1 (phylloquinone). They are also loaded with essential minerals, such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Just one serving of these berries can give you a big boost toward your daily nutritional goals – providing 36 percent of your vitamin K needs, 25 percent of manganese, 24 percent of your vitamin C and 14 percent of dietary fiber. Also, blueberries are naturally low in cholesterol, saturated fat and sodium, making them a heart-healthy choice for any diet. Blueberries improve brain health and cognitive function The antioxidants in blueberries, especially anthocyanins and flavonoids, help protect your brain from damage caused by free radicals. A 2023 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that consuming the equivalent of 178 grams of fresh blueberries daily in the form of wild blueberry powder led to noticeable improvements in cognitive function for older adults at risk of cognitive decline. This suggests that polyphenols in wild blueberries can enhance memory and executive functions . Supporting these findings, a 2021 review from the International Journal of Molecular Sciences highlighted that the antioxidant anthocyanins in blueberries help guard against factors that accelerate brain aging and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. The review found notable improvements in memory and some reported enhancements in attention, executive function and psychomotor speed. Furthermore, a 2019 review of 11 studies published in The Journals of Gerontology, Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences linked a higher intake of flavonoid-rich foods, such as blueberries, to better brain performance . This includes cognitive processes, such as executive function and improved memory in children aged seven to 10, and enhanced executive and psychomotor functions in adults aged 60 and above. (Related: Blueberries: Superfood that can help you improve brain health .) Blueberries improve heart health and cardiovascular function Thanks to their high soluble fiber content, these little berries help your body manage cholesterol levels by binding to cholesterol and bile in the gut and removing them from the body. Since bile contains cholesterol, bile acids and other components, getting rid of it is crucial for keeping your cholesterol levels in check, which is important for maintaining heart health. In addition to fiber, the anthocyanins and polyphenols in blueberries reduce inflammation and improve blood flow by helping clear plaque from arteries. Research published in The British Journal of Nutrition found that blueberries can help prevent the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol, which is a significant step in lowering the risk of heart disease. Moreover, blueberries support healthy blood pressure. They are packed with nutrients, like calcium, magnesium and potassium, which are vital for regulating blood pressure. These fruits are also a natural source of nitric acid, a molecule that helps relax blood vessels – further contributing to lower blood pressure.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-researchers-develop-new-technique-producing-water-moon.html,Researchers develop a new technique for producing water on the moon,"Plans to explore the moon have resulted in researchers developing a unique method that produces water from hydrogen on the moon . China and the State Corporation for Space Activities (Roscosmos), the state corporation of the Russian Federation responsible for space flights, cosmonaut programs and aerospace research, have announced plans to create the International Lunar Research Station (ILRSP). The construction of the permanent base in the moon's southern polar region will start its operations with the delivery of the first surface elements by 2030. Activities are expected to last until about 2040. The ILRSP base is set to allegedly rival NASA's Artemis Program, which will include the creation of the Lunar Gateway in orbit around the moon and the different surface elements of the Artemis Base Camp. However, aside from the cost of building these facilities, many considerable challenges must be addressed by the space agencies involved. For example, the crews operating on the lunar surface for long periods will require regular shipments of supplies. While the International Space Station can easily be resupplied in as little as several hours, sending resupply spacecraft to the moon will take at least three days. Because of the longer delivery time for supplies, NASA and other space agencies are working on methods to harvest resources directly from the lunar environment through a process called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). According to a recently published paper, a research team with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has discovered a new method for producing massive amounts of water through a reaction between lunar regolith and endogenous hydrogen. The research was conducted by Professor Wang Junqiang and his team at the CAS Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering's (NIMTE) Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices. The research team also included scientists from the Center of Materials Science and Optoelectronics Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. The paper is titled ""Massive Water Production from Lunar Ilmenite through Reaction with Endogenous Hydrogen"" and was published in the Chinese journal The Innovation . Researchers have already confirmed that there is water on the moon Since the time that the Apollo missions brought samples of lunar rocks and soil back to Earth for analysis, researchers have confirmed that there is abundant water on the moon. These findings were confirmed by several robotic sample-return missions that followed, including China's Chang’e-5 mission. But much of this water consists of hydroxyl (OH) that is formed because of the interaction of solar wind (ionized hydrogen) and elemental oxygen in the regolith. Additionally, researchers have reported that water in the form of ice can be found in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). PSRs include the many craters that cover the South Pole-Aitken Basin. However, the lunar regolith contains very little hydroxyl that can be converted into water, ranging from 0.0001 percent to 0.02 percent. The icy patches found in cratered regions are also mixed with rocky material, or regolith , forming layers that reach beneath the surface. This makes extraction more difficult regardless of where the water is coming from. After scientists studied the samples returned by the Chang'e-5 mission, the team led by Wang found that the highest concentrations of water were contained in ilmenite (FeTiO3), a titanium-iron oxide mineral found in lunar regolith. The researchers explained that this is because of ""its unique lattice structure with sub-nanometer tunnels."" Next, the researchers conducted several on-site heating experiments that revealed how hydrogen in lunar minerals could be used to produce water on the moon. The findings revealed that the process consists of heating lunar regolith to temperatures exceeding 1,200 K (~930 C; 1700 F) with concave mirrors. This then resulted in the formation of iron crystals and water bubbles in the material, with the latter being released as water vapor. The chemical process is expressed mathematically as FeO/Fe2O3 + H –> Fe + H2O. The resulting water vapor is then reclaimed at a rate of 51 to 76 mg of water for every gram of lunar soil. That means it can produce 50 liters (13.2 gallons) of water for every ton of processed regolith, which experts suggest is enough water for at least 50 people daily. In their paper, the research team reported that ""this amount is ~10,000 times the naturally occurring hydroxyl (OH) and H2O on the moon."" Aside from drinking water, the newly discovered process could provide the necessary irrigation water for growing crops on the moon, another important task for future lunar settlements that will help reduce their dependence on Earth. This same process could also be used to chemically separate hydrogen and oxygen gas from regolith, which could then be turned into propellant, such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX), or used as fuel and for maintaining supplies of breathable oxygen for astronauts. (Related: Declassified documents reveal current and former senators believe the government has secretly recovered UFOs of non-human origin .) The method could also offer another benefit because it is driven almost entirely by focused sunlight, meaning solar arrays can provide the additional power that drives the retention process. However, there is one limiting factor to the process: It will only be possible during a lunar day in the southern polar region , which is where NASA and other space agencies all plan to build their bases. This means that the facility could run for two weeks straight followed by a two-week lull in production. Experts suggest that this hurdle could be addressed by stationing processing facilities away from the polar regions or by creating a series of strategically placed solar mirrors or satellites that can direct light toward the southern polar region. The water-producing method can also potentially be used to harvest water on the moon in a cost-effective way compared to heating regolith in industrial furnaces and could be paired with ice extraction and processing to guarantee that future settlements have access to plenty of water.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-horrifying-link-between-abortion-and-vaccine-development.html,The horrifying link between abortion and vaccine development,"On this week’s episode of The Van Maren Show , Jonathon speaks with Christian Hacking of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform U.K. about his recent research on the gruesome connection between abortion and vaccine development. (Article republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) After diving into Hacking’s background and how he came to the pro-life movement, Jonathon asked him about what public pro-life activism looks like in the U.K. Hacking emphasized that the country is tragically very “pro-choice,” with people in the U.K. generally supporting a woman’s “right” to kill her child if they believe the circumstances warrant it. But one sign of hope is the large number of Britons who feel ignored by globalist policies like mass immigration and others who don’t trust the government, political institutions, and media because of how they handled the COVID pandemic . “It’s that group of people that I think are more pro-life than less,” Hacking said. The activist added that these segments of people see the low birth rate and realize that that’s one reason why there’s mass migration into the country. Lowering the abortion rate might start to solve that problem as the country increases its native population. Meanwhile, the other segment realizes the authorities and institutions don’t really care about them and are fed up with the system. “[I]f those two segments of society can be galvanized and directed, or simply informed, I think the U.K. is rife for reform inconceivable to the current nodding heads of Labor and Conservative.” Jonathon then asked about Hacking about his research for a recent animated video for the pro-life organization CHOICE42 entitled “It’s OK.” The horrifying video told the true stories of babies who were delivered and dissected alive, their organs harvested, and their fetal cell lines used for vaccine research. Hacking first expressed what a privilege it was to work with CHOICE42’s director and founder, Laura Klassen , and praised her diligence in putting the video together. Hacking said he began his research as the COVID vaccines were coming out. “They were rolling out this vaccine, and they were telling everyone to get it. And lots of evangelicals were coming forward and coming up with these crazy ideas of proximity to evil and pushing for people to get vaccinated as being a way to love our brothers and sisters. And, we thought, ‘Wow, there seems to be a lot wrong with this.’” The activist then explained what he started finding after being given the research task. “I basically just started doing a deep dive on HEK-293 [fetal cell lines] and how these cell lines are created. … Even a fetal tissue cell line is a euphemism that really disguises the brutal reality of how these cell lines are originally derived.” This led him to discover the story of Johanna – one of the unnamed babies depicted in the animated video – who was dissected alive at Leiden University in the Netherlands under the direction of Dr. Alexander van der Eb. “So, we’re talking about a little baby girl dying from having her organs removed one by one. And the issue being is that they don’t want to sedate the child, they don’t want to do anything that would disrupt the biological function of the baby, and so it’s just the most barbarous procedure, it’s something that you think would happen in a Japanese experimentation camp or in the scientific department of Auschwitz. But it’s happening in [respectable] European universities in the [1960s] and ’70s.” Jonathon jumped in, asking Hacking to clarify if these experiments were done after the baby was delivered, which he confirmed was correct. The activist noted how, going back to the 1950s, doctors thought they should make use of aborted children in some way and so would use their organs to develop fetal cell lines. “And we’re talking, not just [about] dissections on living babies, but in some of these procedures, the babies were delivered in hysterectomy, to preserve the child [for organ harvesting]. And the whole notion of consent was dubious because the records were all lost.” For more analysis from Christian Hacking, tune in to this week’s episode of The Van Maren Show .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-video-exposes-disturbing-creation-fetal-cell-lines.html,Video exposes the disturbing creation of the fetal cell lines used by the medical industry,"A new pro-life video follows the short lives of the babies aborted and experimented on to create the fetal cell lines used today in the medical industry. (Article by Clare Marie Merkowsky republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) On July 2, pro-life organization CHOICE42 released their latest animated short video titled “It’s OK,” which details the origins of five different fetal cell lines and how they were created from the victims of abortion. “That’s me,” the video opens, with an animated picture of an aborted baby. “I’m Ellie. Don’t feel bad. It’s okay. It was a long time ago, 1962.” “I just thought maybe you don’t know about me,” Ellie continued. “My parents didn’t want me, anyway. The doctor worked with scientists, and they took my organs out as soon as I was aborted.” “It had to be done right away because the organs need to be fresh,” she continued. The video is the third in a series of pro-life animated shorts which reveal the ugly truth behind the abortion industry. The previous two episodes described surgical abortions?and?IVF. The new video was premiered on The Steve Deace Show on The Blaze Network. “I first became aware that fetuses were killed and harvested for fetal cell lines during COVID,” Laura Klassen, director and founder of?CHOICE42 explained. “When I began to research and explain my findings to others, they were always telling me, ‘Well, it’s ok because…’ and went on to list their justifications,” she continued. “Some said, ‘There was only one baby used in the 60s’. Others, ‘There aren’t any more babies being aborted for this today.’ Still others, ‘The doctors just used the dead tissue post-abortion.’” “All false and none of it is ok,” she declared. “We need to stop justifying what happened to these 5 babies (and many others) and take a closer look at what is going on in the medical research world. It’s not ok that it happened in the 60s, and it’s not ok that it’s happening now.” The video follows the short lives of Ellie, David, Johanna, Jordan, and Bo; five babies whose organs were harvested to produce fetal cell lines. The cell lines have since been used in various medical experiments, especially in the production of vaccines. Cell lines from both Johanna and Jordan were used in the creation of the mRNA-based COVID vaccines. Doctors and abortion advocates argue that the babies’ organs were harvested once and using cell lines from aborted babies does not lead to more babies being experimented on. However, the video revealed that hundreds of babies are experimented on before a cell line is obtained, with 32 babies being experimented on in Ellie’s case and a total of 293 experiments being carried out to obtain Johanna’s cell line. The most recent cell line comes from Bo, a baby killed in 2015 to replace the depleting cell line supply. Horrifically, the aborted babies’ cell lines are still for sale today. Even more disturbing is the fact that the babies were experimented on while they were alive and were not given pain medications as it would “ruin the cells.” Dr. Ian Donald, the pioneer of the ultrasound scanner, who witnessed the experiments carried out on Ellie, revealed, “Experiments were being performed on near-term alive aborted babies who were not even afforded the mercy of anesthetic as they writhed and cried in agony, and when their usefulness had expired, they were executed and discarded as garbage.” Read more at: LifeSiteNews.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-new-zealand-covid-vaccines-increased-mortality-rates.html,New data from New Zealand confirms COVID-19 vaccines significantly increase all-cause mortality,"New data from New Zealand shows that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine significantly increases a vaccinated individual's risk of dying . Data from Health New Zealand , the main public health government body in the country, indicates that 85.5 percent of New Zealanders over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated , and significant portions of New Zealand society have also received first and second rounds of booster vaccinations. The data presented by Health New Zealand does not warn of the increased risk of all-cause mortality. Instead, the government webpage that provides data on COVID-19 vaccinations only has a one-paragraph reminder that the COVID-19 vaccine may cause ""usually mild"" side effects. (Related: New Zealand legalizes FORCED VACCINATIONS – refuses to be tied to beds and forcibly injected .) ""Like all medicines, the COVID-19 vaccine may cause side effects in some people,"" Health New Zealand warned. ""These are common, are usually mild, don't last long, and won't stop people from having the second dose or going about daily life. Serious allergic reactions do occur but are extremely rare."" Researcher Steve Kirsch and his team analyzed the data using methodology used by governments around the world. Through this investigation, he notes that it has become very clear that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing all-cause mortality to increase. ""When seasonal mortality is strongly declining, the mortality of the vaccinated is increasing. When seasonal mortality is strongly increasing, the mortality of the vaccinated is increasing even more,"" wrote Kirsch on his Substack blog. ""In short, if you chose to get vaccinated, your mortality increased. The mortality increase happened every time you got a shot. It's crystal clear."" COVID-19 vaccines reason for spike in all-cause mortality in New Zealand According to the data, when the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began in New Zealand, all-cause mortality in New Zealand increased from its baseline by 11.8 percent. Kirsch noted that the New Zealand government told the public that deaths were up at the time because the population grew, which is technically accurate. ""But they deliberately misled the public because the deaths per capita (which is what matters) increased,"" wrote Kirsch. ""So even though the population increased, deaths increased even more."" In 2020, the number of deaths per 100,000 was 639. In 2021, that number rose to 682.7 deaths per 100,000 people, and by 2022 it surged even more to 748 deaths per 100,000 – a per-capita death rate not seen in over two decades. ""When they deliberately deceive the people like this and the press lets them get away with it, it is an indicator of a very high level of corruption,"" warned Kirsch, who lamented the lack of transparency regarding the COVID-19 vaccines in New Zealand. ""The entire system is corrupt and bought off … there isn't any transparency of public health data,"" he continued. ""This should make everyone furious. Every mainstream media outlet should be calling for … transparency so that the public learns the truth about the vaccines . But they are all silent. There is absolutely no excuse for public health authorities not providing this.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-irish-teacher-arrested-refusing-address-male-student-she.html,GENDER WARS: Irish teacher ARRESTED for refusing to address male student as “she/her”,"Another educator's career was ruined after a male student in Ireland suffering from gender dysphoria complained that teacher Enoch Burke refused to refer to the student using ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns, resulting in Burke being arrested and imprisoned. Burke, a Christian man, has been jailed three times over his refusal to play gender pronoun games with his students and coworkers. Burke's faith requires him to reject the mental delusions of LGBTs who often respond by bullying him as retribution. The High Court in Dublin has ordered Burke to be committed for contempt after he appeared at Wilson's Hospital School in County Westmeath after being told via an injunction that he is prohibited from entering the premises. Back in August 2022, the evangelical Christian was suspended from his job for refusing to use a transgender student's preferred gender pronouns. That suspension was later dismissed following appeal, and Burke will remain on the school's payroll until a ruling is issued. (Related: Did you know that Joe Biden's 2024 Title IV revisions threaten to criminalize students who are caught ""misgendering"" their LGBTQ classmates?) LGBTs persecuting normal people On September 2, Justice Michael Quinn ruled that Burke remains in ""ongoing contempt"" of previous court orders demanding that he stay behind bars at Mountjoy Prison until he agrees to obey the Cult of LGBTQ and its demands. Burke continues to argue that the school and the courts are trampling his religious rights by trying to force him to play the transgender pronoun game, which he refuses to do out of obedience to God. ""This is a mockery of justice,"" Burke told Justice Quinn, arguing that he is being punished by the state for his Christian beliefs. Amazingly, Burke has thus far spent more than 400 days in prison with multiple previous incarcerations, all of which were predicated upon his refusal to refer to boys as ""girls,"" and vice versa. Burke's most recent release was back in June when the school where he teaches was closed for summer break. At the time, he released a video statement – watch below – explaining the toll his legal battle is taking on him and his family. ""I've been here for 400 days consecutively and two years of my life have been taken from me,"" Burke explains in the video. ""It's a sad place, Mountjoy Prison. A lot of very genuine people who have been let down, I would say, by the state, by the government, and in some cases by the courts."" Wilson Hospital School, a boarding school located about 55 miles (88 kilometers) west of Dublin is historically part of the Church of Ireland. The school still claims to honor its Church of Ireland heritage by ""fostering Christian practice and teaching."" How can this be true, though, when Burke, a Christian himself, is being persecuted by the Wilson Hospital School and some of its students? When the summer break ended and Burke returned to class on August 22, the Wilson Hospital School board tried to get him arrested again – so much for ""fostering Christian practice and teaching,"" eh? Burke is continuing to fight the false allegations against him and continues to try to battle his way out of persecution with an appeal. The school's leadership, meanwhile, is arguing that Burke's mere presence on campus is disruptive to both staff and students and that he must be removed immediately. The world economy is currently in the throes of what appears to be an impending total collapse but LGBT extremists are much more concerned about policing the pronouns that other people choose to use in reference to them – can you say misplaced priorities and hypocrisy?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-diversity-nutritionist-says-unprocessed-whole-foods-racist.html,Diversity nutritionist says unprocessed whole foods are RACIST,"A ""Queer. Black. Fat-positive dietitian"" from California is on a mission to stop the war on ultra-processed food because she believes that opposing junk food means opposing ""people of color"" (POC). Jessica Wilson, MS, RD, has apparently convinced herself that unhealthy eating is a normal part of being a POC, and that those who suggest healthier whole food-based diets are guilty of racism. TIME wrote a piece about how Wilson was irked by the 2023 release of Ultra-Processed People , a book by Dr. Chris van Tulleken that highlighted how a junk food diet wrecked his health. ""What happened to me is exactly what the research says would happen to everyone,"" van Tulleken wrote about how his health declined after switching to a diet mostly composed of chips, soda pop, bagged bread, frozen food and cereal. Eating all that junk caused van Tulleken to feel sluggish and gain weight. His hormone levels got thrown all out of whack and MRI scans showed that even his brain got damaged. Wilson, however, feels as though van Tulleken is exaggerating and over-sensationalizing what the junk food did to his body because she feels that processed foods are a normal part of people's lives, as least the lives of POC whom she says tend to eat more junk food than white people. Non-whites tend to have lower incomes and live in ""food deserts"" where there are fewer grocery stores carrying fresh produce and a whole lot more fast-food joints that serve fried, ultra-processed food-like substances. Wilson claims that this differentiation between healthy foods and unhealthy foods is a form of ""food apartheid"" that makes no sense to her. ""How can this entire category of foods be something we're supposed to avoid?"" she asked. (Related: Remember when Joe Biden tried to ban data for being ""racist,"" claiming that information all by itself is a form of white supremacy?) Full meals of ultra-processed foods made Wilson feel better Wilson conducted her own experiment to contrast with that of van Tulleken. She traded out her haphazard attempts at eating whole foods randomly throughout the day with set meals comprised of more ultra-processed things. Instead of eating morning eggs, for instance, Wilson opted for soy chorizo. She also swapped out of homemade ""thrown-together"" lunches with Trader Joe's ready-to-eat tamales. Then there was the cashew ""milk"" yogurt with jam, Costco pupusas, and chicken sausage with veggies. After making the switch to a more ultra-processed diet, Wilson claims she started to feel better with less anxiety and more energy. She drank less coffee and felt better than she had before, which she attributes to eating full meals with more calories. Unlike van Tulleken, Wilson did not get any bloodwork done to see what her dietary changes did to her body. She simply reported that she ""felt better"" after doing her experiment. ""I finally understand where this sudden push in defense of ultra-processed foods comes from: the desire of the psychopaths to replace meat and other healthy foods with fake products,"" one commenter wrote. ""The obvious criticism would be that such artificial food-like products are ultra-processed garbage, and thus ultra-processed foods suddenly have to become 'healthy.' Duh."" The other obvious answer as to why ultra-processed food is suddenly in vogue among the pro-fat crowd is because it is cheap and generates large profits for the same multinational corporate interests that came up with the so-called ""food pyramid."" ""This is to keep the masses sick and weak,"" wrote another. ""Four out of five eugenicists surveyed prefer ultra-processed foods,"" joked another. ""The fifth died from myocarditis.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-ivermectin-outperforms-chemo-breast-cancer-treatment-study.html,"Ivermectin outperforms chemo in breast cancer treatment, study finds","Research out of Mexico has uncovered another use for ivermectin than just getting rid of parasites and coronaviruses. It turns out that ivermectin is also an effective remedy against cancer. Research dating back to 1996 shows a link between the two, with more recent research published in 2017 showing that ivermectin is an inhibitor of cancer stem cells. While tumor growth is generally driven by so-called bulk tumor cells, there is another subpopulation of cells within cancer tumors that present a stem cell phenotype. As such, these cells are referred to in the scientific literature as ""cancer stem-like cells"" or CSCs. What makes cancer stem-like cells such a threat is the fact that they have unlimited self-renew properties, meaning they just keep reproducing endlessly. This is how many severe cancers take over a person's body and lay it waste, often very quickly depending on the type. Back in 2009, researchers from MIT and Harvard found that salinomycin, another antiparasitic drug, helps to reduce breast cancer stem cells by more than 100-fold compared to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (Taxol). Salinomycin also inhibited the growth of breast tumors, the research team found. Building upon this earlier research, scientists from Mexico City in the more recent study from 2017 looked for the molecule most resembling salinomycin. They probed 1,623 compounds, only to learn that the one responsible for destroying cancer cells is none other than ivermectin. ""Ivermectin preferentially inhibits the viability of cancer stem cell-enriched populations compared with the total cell population,"" their research states. ""The opposite pattern was observed with paclitaxel treatment."" (Related: In order for ivermectin to work at its best, one must take the drug with high-fat foods for maximum absorption.) Ivermectin decreases expression of ""stemness genes"" expressed in cancer stem cells Another thing ivermectin does, according to the newer research, is prevent three different ""stemness genes"" from expressing themselves. These stemness genes are highly expressed in cancer stem cells, and by inhibiting their expression, ivermectin makes it a lot harder for cancer tumors to grow and spread. In their conclusion, the Mexican scientists declared that, based on everything they looked at, ivermectin preferentially targets the stem cell population in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, which are what they studied. ""Ivermectin has been demonstrated to be safe, following treatment of millions of patients with onchocerciasis and other parasitic diseases, which makes it a strong candidate for further studies investigating its potential use as a repurposed drug for cancer therapy,"" the study further concludes. All in all, ivermectin was found to work significantly better – up to 100-fold and with no serious side effects – than chemotherapy drugs. The drug selectively targets the cancer stem cells that not only interfere with conventional cancer treatments but also drive metastasis and breast cancer recurrence. ""Bottom line: Every advanced breast cancer patient should get ivermectin to eliminate cancer stem cells and reduce the risks of treatment failure, metastases and recurrence,"" tweeted Dr. William Makis, M.D., about the discovery. ""So why don't they? I think we all know the answer."" Keep in mind that mammograms only make the problem worse by smashing open the cancer lumps. This causes the parasites to get released and ""go wild,"" which in turn leads to serious cancer diagnoses. ""Ivermectin is proving to be an extraordinary drug with a wide range of potential benefits beyond its traditional uses,"" someone wrote in response to Dr. Makis' post. ""The research on its effectiveness against cancer stem cells, particularly when combined with other treatments like fenbendazole or menbendazole, is compelling. It's remarkable how a drug that's been around for decades continues to reveal its versatility and potential in treating serious conditions like cancer.""

In exclusive interviews with the newspaper National Catholic Register, clerics from all across sub-Saharan Africa decried the subversive attempts by Western NGOs, aid workers and even tourists to promote LGBT ideology and attract Africans into homosexual activity for money. ""It's just like the missionaries who went all over to evangelize,"" said Archbishop Renatus Leonard Nkwande of the Archdiocese of Mwanza in Tanzania. Except now, he lamented, the West is ""sending us missionaries of evil."" Archbishop Charles Palmer-Buckle of the Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Coast in Ghana told the newspaper how tourists would entice boys with money to pull them into homosexual activity . ""They've come to enjoy themselves and they are messing with our little boys on the beach, sexually abusing them for a little money,"" Palmer-Buckle said. ""They are already warped. And they are warping these young people. It's like, sorry to say, the devil trying to get more disciples."" Palmer-Buckle added that foreign aid workers have also often promoted LGBT ideology in classrooms and other venues despite prohibitions in their charters on such activism. ""As a teacher, it is not your right to expose the child to that which is harmful to them in the long run, as if you are proselytizing,"" he said. Kenya's encounters with activists for homosexuality are the same as what happened in Ghana where the Western NGO staff promote LGBT ideology in schools and pay youth to engage in gay sex, according to clergy. Meanwhile, in Tanzania, gay pornography propositions have become so common that the Archdiocese of Mwanza launched a task force geared toward teaching youth how to deal with invitations to engage in immoral sexual activity. ""We have decided to do it because we have seen a number of people coming, gathering young people, and entertaining them,"" Archbishop Leonard Nkwande said. ""At the end, they are like that."" The moves are consistent with the declaration of United States Department of State spokesman John Kirby last year that so-called ""LGBTQ+ rights"" are a ""core part"" of U.S. foreign policy and the December 2023 report that the U.S. had spent more than $4.1 billion in taxpayer money on LGBT-promoting initiatives around the world. The widespread reports indicate that this homosexual indoctrination is part of a large, coordinated plan, according to African archbishops. ""We don't speak about it openly, but it's intentional,"" Nkwande told the Register . Related: Transgender ideology comes ""from the depths of hell,"" warns Christian journalist .) Bishops warn Western secularization and hedonism are promoted by social media Social media has a great impact on the Western's promotion of LGBTQ+ ideologies. More than 60 percent of residents have a smartphone, a much higher rate than the average sub-Saharan country, especially in places like Kenya. Makumba draws a sharp distinction between the message brought by outside evangelizers decades ago and the Western messages of secularization and hedonism promoted in Kenya by the social media platforms of today. ""When the missionaries came, they came with the Good News,"" he said. ""Now, the culture coming through social media is not good news. It is bad news."" In Obala, Cameroon, Bishop Sosthene Leopold Bayemi Matjei said that social media content from countries like France, the central African country's former colonizer, is leading to a dramatic remaking of values among Cameroonian youth. Matjei added he is aware of reports that young boys are organizing sex groups after being exposed to the idea through online videos. ""These are things that I've never dreamt of,"" he said. ""But now we see that they are arriving."" Ideological proselytization in Africa at the personal and cultural level is moving in tandem with ideological colonization at the level of public policy, which Pope Francis has said ""destroys the human personality."" Abortion is illegal in Cameroon, but the bishop said the French embassy actively promoted it in March after France enshrined abortion as a ""guaranteed freedom"" in its constitution. NGOs also reportedly give grants to facilities in Cameroon to perform free abortions, which are tolerated by the local government. Meanwhile, several African nations have responded to the West's ideological push on homosexuality by drafting stringent measures meant to curb the spread of LGBTQ ideology. Some of these bills make it illegal to publicly identify as gay, while others carry with them harsh sentences for gay sex. In return, the U.S. sanctioned Uganda for passing a bill that makes homosexual activity a possible capital offense. There is speculation that Ghana's legislation restricting the spread of LGBTQ activism could lose the African country $3.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-05-voice-analysis-tech-detect-diabetes-speech-patterns.html,STUDY: Voice analysis tech can accurately detect Type 2 diabetes through speech patterns,"A groundbreaking new study from Canada suggests that doctors could diagnose diabetes by simply analyzing the voice of a patient from the initial conversation. Voice analysis technology is emerging as a powerful tool in medical diagnostics, offering a non-invasive method to detect various health conditions. It uses artificial intelligence to detect subtle changes in speech that are imperceptible to human listeners. The software can analyze recordings from regular phone conversations – focusing on aspects like melody, pauses, pitch and speech rhythm. By examining these elements, AI can identify specific vocal patterns associated with different health conditions. The recent Canadian study uncovered a novel link between blood sugar levels and voice pitch , suggesting new ways to monitor health without invasive procedures. Published in Scientific Reports in 2024, the study found that as blood sugar level rises, so does the pitch of a person's voice. This pattern was observed not only in people with diabetes but also in those with normal blood glucose levels – indicating a broader application for this discovery. The relationship was slightly less pronounced in individuals already diagnosed with diabetes. The human voice has up to 200,000 unique characteristics and AI algorithms can filter through these to find patterns linked to specific diseases. For detecting Type 2 diabetes , the AI evaluated brief voice recordings – only six to 10 seconds long – by analyzing variations in loudness and pitch. When combined with basic health information, such as age, gender, height and weight, this method can accurately indicate the presence of Type 2 diabetes. The results of this technology are impressive, with the AI achieving an accuracy rate of 90 percent for women and 86 percent for men. Researchers like Jaycee Kaufman from Ontario Tech University gathered over 18,000 voice samples from 267 participants – both with or without diabetes – to train the AI system. This research identified 14 specific acoustic features that vary between those with and without the condition, paving the way for more accessible diagnostic methods. Kaufman noted that current detection methods can be costly and require significant time and travel. In contrast, voice analysis could eliminate these barriers – making early diagnosis more accessible. Moving forward, Klick Labs plans to explore the potential of voice analysis to detect other conditions, such as hypertension and prediabetes – expanding its use in preventive healthcare. By studying speech patterns, researchers can identify early signs of diseases and conditions like heart problems, mental health disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and even post-traumatic stress disorder. This enables health care professionals to diagnose conditions sooner. In earlier research by Klick Labs in Toronto, AI was used to analyze short voice recordings to detect Type 2 diabetes. A study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health demonstrated that just a few seconds of recorded speech could determine the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes with a high degree of accuracy. This technology is particularly valuable in identifying undiagnosed diabetes , which affects an estimated 240 million people worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Most of these cases are Type 2 diabetes, a condition that increases the risk of severe health issues like heart attacks, poor circulation and strokes. Traditional diabetes tests, such as fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and oral glucose tolerance test, typically require visits to health care facilities and can be expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, voice analysis offers a faster, more convenient screening method – potentially increasing early detection rates and reducing health care burdens, Risks associated with voice analysis technology Voice analysis technology is being hailed as a fast and efficient way to detect various diseases using just a person's speech. However, there are significant concerns about its limitations and potential misuse. While AI-based tools can provide detailed insights from voice patterns, relying solely on a few voice samples is not enough to make a reliable medical diagnosis . There is a considerable risk of false positives or overdiagnoses, where conditions might be flagged incorrectly. Ultimately, a human professional should always review the results and make the final judgment. This is especially true for diagnosing mental health issues . For example, certain voice tones might suggest someone is experiencing depression, but a thorough evaluation by a trained professional is essential to confirm this. AI might detect changes in speech patterns that suggest disorganization or impulsiveness – potentially pointing to conditions, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, only a medical expert can accurately diagnose such conditions, ensuring that any findings are not misinterpreted. There are also serious concerns about how voice analysis could be misused. Privacy advocates warn that this technology could be exploited by employers or insurance companies without proper consent. This could lead to individuals being unfairly treated based on sensitive health data gleaned from their voice. Additionally, there is a risk that protected and personal health information could be hacked , shared or sold without the person's knowledge. (Related: Health apps are BAD for your privacy: 80% or more share your data, research reveals .) Given these risks, it is crucial to have clear guidelines and strict regulations to prevent misuse. While scientists can highlight these issues, setting boundaries and ensuring the ethical use of voice analysis technology is ultimately the responsibility of policymakers.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-04-uv-exposure-health-benefits-people-limited-sunlight.html,U.K. study: Increased UV exposure may offer health benefits for people in areas with limited sunlight,"A study suggests that higher exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays may offer health benefits for people in areas with limited sunlight . The research published in the peer-reviewed public health-focused journal Health and Place of the University of Edinburgh indicates that getting more sunlight could potentially extend life expectancy by lowering the risks of heart disease and cancer . The study analyzed data from 395,000 people across the U.K. and found that those in sunnier regions had a 19 percent lower risk of dying from heart conditions and a 12 percent lower risk of cancer-related deaths compared to those in less sunny areas. Using sunbeds (also known as tanning beds) was associated with a 23 percent lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 14 percent lower risk of cancer death compared to those who didn’t use them. However, the researchers pointed out that this might be due to a general tendency among sunbed users to spend more time in the sun overall. Despite the potential benefits, researchers emphasize the need to protect the skin from sunburn and skin cancer –especially in areas with strong UV rays. The study focused on individuals of White European descent, highlighting the importance of balancing UV exposure with skin protection in public health guidance, particularly in low-sunlight regions. While the study did find a slight increase in melanoma cases with higher UV exposure, it didn’t lead to a rise in deaths from the condition. The findings are most relevant to those living in areas with less sunlight and the researchers call for further studies in regions with higher UV levels to better understand these effects. Public health advice typically focuses on the dangers of UV exposure – especially regarding skin cancer. However, this study adds to the growing evidence that in areas with low sunlight, the benefits of UV exposure might outweigh the risks. Guidelines should consider both the risks and benefits of UV exposure, especially in regions with less sunlight. This approach could help lower the rates of disease and increase life expectancy. The Australian Skin and Skin Cancer Research Center has also recommended a balanced approach to sun exposure . Caution advised due to health risks associated with using sunbeds Using sunbeds helps expose the skin to UV radiation to stimulate melanin production and darken the skin. However, this type of UV exposure is linked to an increased risk of skin cancer , including melanoma and other health problems. Despite these risks, many people still use sunbeds globally. In 2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified UV radiation from sunbeds as a carcinogen –placing it in the same dangerous category as asbestos and tobacco. This prompted the Society of Behavioral Medicine in 2014 to advocate for a ban on indoor tanning for minors (those under the age of 18)–a view also supported by the American Academy of Dermatology and Pediatrics. There is a false belief that UV rays from sunbeds are safer than those from natural sunlight. In reality, UV radiation from tanning beds can harm DNA in skin cells – increasing the risk of melanoma, as well as basal and squamous cell cancers. (Related: Feds push for mandatory cancer warnings on tanning beds (but not radiotherapy devices .) Besides cancer risks, sunbeds are associated with eye cancer, skin aging, skin burns and weakened immune function. The different UV wavelengths emitted by these devices add to their potential danger–highlighting the need for strict regulations. Sunbeds emit both UVA and UVB radiation. UVB rays directly damage DNA by creating specific genetic mutations, which can disrupt cellular functions. UVA rays cause indirect damage through reactive oxygen species, leading to further mutations. Although natural sunlight primarily consists of UVA rays, sunbeds emit UV radiation 10 to 15 times more intense than sunlight, making them much more harmful. Are tanning beds bad for you?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-04-japan-to-unleash-self-replicating-mrna-vaccines.html,"GLOBAL EMERGENCY UNFOLDING: Japan will unleash Bill Gates-approved, SELF-REPLICATING mRNA vaccines starting next month","Bill Gate's diabolical plan to change vaccines is being expedited once more. After supporting lockdowns and vaccine mandates to capitalize on his global mRNA vaccine initiatives, he now wants the world population to take vaccines with ""longer duration and greater coverage."" This is the promise for a new class of ""self-replicating"" vaccines that are designed to amplify in people, all on their own. By October 2024, Japan will become the first nation to introduce this controversial new type of COVID-19 vaccine called a self-replicating vaccine . The vaccine, known as Kostaive (ARCT-154), is a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine (saRNA) that replicates within the body, creating copies of foreign proteins and GENES for long-term encoding and long-term manipulation of antibody responses. New saRNA vaccines replicate genes for long term manipulation of the individual's immune response This new class of saRNA vaccines goes beyond the traditional antigen/adjuvant based vaccine model and takes the process of mRNA vaccines a step further, integrating the GENES needed for the replication and synthesis of the spike protein-encoding RNA. Unlike mRNA vaccines, which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists, saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This ""biological printing press"" could theoretically amplify the vaccine’s presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. If these saRNA vaccines are anything like the mRNA vaccines, then the heart and brain damage they impose will be ongoing and unstoppable – a precursor to suffering and early death. To make matters worse, the shedding process will be guaranteed for months and possibly years after vaccination, turning vaccinated individuals into toxic factories for spreading biological warfare. Self-replicating vaccines pose global risks to humans and other species The Japanese government approved Kostaive in November 2023, following a series of sham clinical trials that demonstrated its potential efficacy against the latest advertised version of COVID-19. Dr. Daniel Nagase, a prominent critic of the new vaccine technology, has voiced severe concerns about the potential global risks with this new technology, especially when it comes to prolonged occupational exposure to the shedding process of these foreign proteins and genes. According to Dr. Nagase, the artificial genes introduced by these vaccines could spread beyond human hosts, potentially contaminating the environment, negatively affecting other people and other species. He warned that this could lead to a ""worldwide disaster,"" particularly if these foreign genes enter ecosystems and transmission occurs between species . Nagase warns that once vaccine campaigns begin, it will be virtually impossible to prevent the “multiplied vaccine from entering the bodies of others.” Alphaviruses , the foundation for the saRNA vaccines, are known for their ability to cross species barriers and survive outside of hosts. This characteristic raises fears that the genetic material from the vaccine could recombine with other viruses or spread through insects like mosquitoes, further complicating containment efforts. There are 32 alphavirus species that infect various vertebrates, including humans, rodents, fish, birds and larger mammals, as well as invertebrates. These viruses can be either species-specific or capable of infecting multiple hosts. Mosquitoes are the primary means of transmission between different species , including vertebrates and humans. Earlier this year, thousands of Japanese citizens protested against the World Health Organization’s Pandemic Treaty and the introduction of mRNA and replicon vaccines. A letter from Motoyoshi Tokuna, addressed to various embassies in Japan, echoed these fears, suggesting that immediate evacuation and entry bans are necessary to prevent the spread of replicon vaccine genes. The letter warned that once these genes are introduced into the environment, controlling their spread could become nearly impossible. This next phase of transhumanism will introduce new genes to control immune systems and enable the runaway manufacture of biological weapons in people.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-04-90-pages-nashville-trans-shooter-manifesto-released.html,All 90 pages of Nashville trans shooter’s manifesto RELEASED: Here are some highlights,"The Tennessee Star just released all 90 pages of the Nashville trans shooter's manifesto, and it is as disturbing as you might expect. Steven Crowder shared a few tidbits from the manifesto, including one section in which shooter Audrey Hale blasphemously wrote that if God refuses to give her ""a boy body,"" then it must mean that Jesus, his son, is a member of the LGBT community. ""I can't be happy,"" reads another section in Hale's manifesto. ""I am meant to die."" The Star further revealed that the Covenant School shooter's journal, which was penned between January and March of 2023, contains many journal entries in which Hale referred to herself as ""Aiden,"" her chosen male name. ""Why does my brain not work right?"" Hale asked herself in another of the entries. ""Cause I was born wrong!!!"" All throughout the manifesto, Hale drew a strange octagonal symbol, including on her notebook cover. That same symbol accompanied many of her entries detailing how she planned to shoot up the school. ""Soon I will leave this world!"" Hale declared in her journal. ""You [and] your friends will be just fine. Does it even matter if I am alive?"" Next to one of the octagonal shapes she drew, Hale also wrote about it the following: ""No regrets by the gun!!!"" If you are interested, the full 90 pages of Hale's journal are available to view at TennesseeStar.com . (Related: Last year, federal officials described the manifesto as containing ""astronomically dangerous"" ideas.) Audrey Hale's disturbed ramblings Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake commented about the spiral notebook and its contents, revealing that it is so full of information that not even he has yet looked through all of it. ""In the manifesto, there's several different writings about other locations, there were locations, [it] talks about the school, there was a map of the school, a drawing of how, potentially, she would enter and the assaults that would take place,"" Drake said. ""It's quite a bit of writing to it. I have not read the whole entire manifesto. Our team and the FBI have been working on this."" It turns out that Hale kept an entire library of journals dating back to at least 2007. MNPD officers, accompanied by agents from the FBI and ATF, seized about 20 more of them beyond just the manifesto that Hale penned between 2007 and 2022. All in all, this collection of journals amounts to about 1,000 pages of journal entries. Authorities also collected numerous videos from Hale's parents' residence, as well as a suicide note and duplicate flash drives containing information that some believe Hale wanted the police to find during their raid. What authorities are now referring to as Hale's ""manifesto"" represents all of these various documents as well as other information and items seized from her parents' home. Altogether, this is what the media is referring to collectively as the ""manifesto."" ""Our reporting on the Covenant Killer investigation has served the public interest,"" commented Patrick Leahy, the Editor-in-Chief of The Star . ""We legally obtained writings by Audrey Elizabeth Hale, MNPD investigation documents, and MNPD crime scene photos from a source familiar with the MNPD investigation in June 2024. These documents and photos have helped us inform the public about the underlying reasons for this heinous attack, and have helped drive the public discussion of what should be done to prevent such acts of violence in the future. We have documented a massive failure of the mental health system as a root cause of Hale’s reprehensible actions.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-04-monkeypox-vaccine-secretly-being-shipped-nationwide.html,Trucking company owner claims MONKEYPOX VACCINE secretly being distributed ahead of November elections,"The monkeypox vaccine is secretly being shipped across the country ahead of the November elections, a trucking company owner is claiming. The business owner issued this warning during a recent episode of ""The Alex Jones Show"" on InfoWars . He reached out to Jones to spread awareness, telling the InfoWars founder that the order to distribute the monkeypox injection came from Big Pharma . ""All of a sudden, [my company] was blowing up with [inquiries] about 'Can you help us?' 'Can you send more trucks and drivers?' It is for the next three to four days and into next week,"" he disclosed. ""They must be pumping out a large volume of this what they called mpox (not monkeypox) vaccines."" The trucker answered affirmatively when Jones clarified if the orders specifically pertained to monkeypox vaccines. The caller continued: ""Specifically it will go onto our trucks to the airports and then onto cargo aircraft, possibly for a worldwide distribution, or at least throughout the country."" Another caller named David, a retired Department of Homeland Security employee, also exposed the secret distribution of the injections. David started a trucking company after retirement and shared to Jones that he also received calls from Cardinal Health. He was asked to transport the vaccines from La Vergne, Tennessee directly to Memphis, then Indianapolis and into an aircraft to be shipped throughout America at a record pace. David told Jones: ""I think, like the COVID-19 scare, this is going to be the next big scare, keeping people from the polls and inside their homes, forcing them to take a vaccination to keep their job, to buy groceries or whatever it might be."" Jones also confirmed that he talked to a reliable source who confirmed that infrastructure is being set up for a lockdown , civil unrest and civil emergency, which he said is a politically correct term for ""martial law."" The distribution of the monkeypox vaccine coincided with the increasing attention on the disease, particularly after the outbreak that occurred in recent years. The timing of these shipments, just as the country prepares for the 2024 presidential election, has led to speculation about whether the vaccine is being stockpiled or prepared for wider use soon, YourNews reported. UNICEF allows immediate access to mpox vaccines for countries with ""high cases"" Meanwhile, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recently launched an emergency tender for monkeypox vaccines to help countries hardest hit by the recent outbreak of the disease. ""The emergency tender is designed to secure immediate access to available mpox vaccines as well as to expand production,"" the UN agency said in a statement issued along with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (Related: Fearmongering as policy: WHO's Tedros mulls public health emergency declaration over hyped-up MONKEYPOX outbreak .) Depending on the production capacity of manufacturers, agreements for up to 12 million doses through 2025 can be made, according to the statement. UNICEF also plans to set up conditional supply agreements with vaccine manufacturers. This will enable UNICEF to purchase and ship vaccines without delay once countries and partners have secured financing, confirmed demand and readiness, and the regulatory requirements for accepting the vaccines are in place. The statement added that WHO is reviewing information submitted by manufacturers on Aug. 23 and expects to complete a review for an emergency use listing by mid-September. The agency is reviewing applications for emergency licenses for two vaccines made by Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics. On Aug. 14, WHO declared an international emergency over monkeypox amid the ""surge in cases"" of the new Clade 1b strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that spread to nearby countries. More than 18,000 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported in the DRC so far this year, with 629 deaths. Several outbreaks of different monkeypox clades have occurred in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk. In the past month, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of Clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighboring the DRC that have not reported monkeypox before – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. But experts believe the true number of cases to be higher as a large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-04-former-teacher-gets-5-years-in-prison.html,Former teacher gets 5 years in prison after threatening judge over pro-parental rights ruling,"A homosexual former teacher has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for threatening a judge over her decision against a challenge to Florida’s parental rights in education bill. (Article by Matt Lamb republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) “U.S. District Judge William F. Jung today sentenced Stephen Jay Thorn (66, Pensacola) to five years in federal prison for transmitting a threat to harm a federal judge and members of the judge’s immediate family,” the Department of Justice announced on August 28. “Thorn entered a guilty plea on May 16, 2024.” Pro-LGBT news outlets have reported Thorn is gay. Thorn reportedly left the hateful messages for Judge Wendy Berger, who had ruled against a challenge to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 . The law generally forbids teachers from discussing sexual topics with students in grades kindergarten through third. The bill has been modified to allow for some discussion of sexual topics, drawing criticism from parental rights groups, LifeSiteNews previously reported. Dishonest media outlets and opponents have labeled it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Thorn was angry that Berger ruled against a challenge and left threatening messages in 2022. “Let’s see how you would like it if somebody endangered your children in school or your grandchildren in school,” Thorn said, as reported by Reuters. “You are an embarrassment to the judicial system.” “Thorn said he had looked up where the judge, her husband and two children lived and said the judge was ‘very easy to track,'” Reuters reported. “I’m a retired teacher. I’ve taught in Florida. I’ve taught in California. I have seen the sheer hell those kids are put through and you have the gall to say that’s part of middle school or high school is to be picked on,” Thorn said in his voicemails, WFLA reported. The Florida outlet also reported: “This is for that stupid redneck, ****, judge, [redacted],” Thorn said in one message. “You are a cruel person. You think that it’s okay for LGBTQ kids to be bullied, which is what that law is allowing, that’s what it’s saying that they’re second-class citizens. Listen dumb***, you’re easy to track you down.” Thorn added, “I’m not a vindictive person and I wouldn’t hurt anyone just like you’ve hurt a whole community, thousands of LGBTQ kids in the state of Florida, a state of 22 million people, you ******* vicious ****.” In his apology letter, Thorn said he overreacted and should have waited. He also said he used to advise LGBT clubs in school and has an adult son who is homosexual. He wrote : I realize now that rather than react to one of her rulings rashly and angrily immediately after reading a newspaper article about her ruling, I should have waited a minimum of 72 hours to make my point with her in a polite and professional manner, instead of handling it the way I did. I am not attempting to justify my overreaction to her ruling, but please understand it was not coming from a place of malice in my heart and/or mind. I don’t feel this is necessarily the time or the place to go into my reasons for leaving her the voicemail message I did, but suffice it to say I spent a large portion of my teaching career advocating for LGBTQ+ public school students, and volunteering for LGBTQ+ youth advocacy organizations in both Florida and in California. I am also the parent of two adult sons, one of whom is gay. Consequently, this factored into my overreaction, as well. Prosecutors sought 30 months in prison, but Judge Jung doubled the sentence. “Threatening harm against public officials, or their families, is an intolerable offense,” U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg stated in the news release. “My office takes such threats seriously and is committed to investigating and federally prosecuting anyone who threatens this sort of violence.” Read more at: LifeSiteNews.com"

However, the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) health survey data finds that the number of Americans believing COVID-19 vaccination misinformation has risen and their willingness to take or recommend vaccination against coronavirus is lower than in the past. The 2024 Annenberg Science and Public Health (ASAPH) knowledge survey, a nationally representative panel survey of nearly 1,500 U.S. adults, suggests that many may be reluctant to get the updated vaccine.

The survey results detail the most recent wave of responses , which was collected in July from a nationally representative sample of 1,496 adults, most of whom have been routinely surveyed in the project since April 2021. Roughly 100 of the adults were added after 2021 due to attrition of the survey's initial participants. In addition to showing an overall decline in willingness to vaccinate, the results showed what the APPC press release called a ""greater acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation."" ""With the [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ] CDC reporting that COVID-19 infection remains an ongoing threat and an updated vaccine available, now is the time to ramp up awareness both of the value of vaccinating against COVID-19 and of the risks of contracting the disease,"" Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who directs the APPC and leads its survey efforts, claimed in a statement. Many U.S. adults believe it is safer to get COVID-19 infection than get a vaccine The percentage of U.S. adults who think the COVID-19 vaccine changes people's DNA rose from eight percent in April 2021 to 15 percent in July 2024. Jamieson said: ""Belief in these three misconceptions is associated with increased reluctance to vaccinate."" Survey results of the APPC revealed that relatively few are worried as only one in five people (20 percent as of July) are somewhat or very worried they or someone in their family will contract COVID-19. The figures are down from 25 percent in February and 35 percent in October last year. Under half of those surveyed, or 44 percent, said in February that they are ""somewhat likely"" or ""very likely"" to get a yearly COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended by the CDC. The numbers were down from 52 percent in June 2023. The poll also revealed that U.S. adults are skeptical about other vaccines, not just the COVID-19 injections. Nearly a third (32 percent) of U.S. adults said they were unsure of the effectiveness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Additionally, 23 percent were uncertain about the pneumonia vaccine, 19 percent doubted the shingles vaccine and 47 percent were unsure about the RSV vaccine during pregnancy or at age 60 and older (37 percent).

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-03-unprocessed-whole-foods-are-racist-nutritionist-claims.html,"Unprocessed whole foods are racist, diversity nutritionist claims","Jessica Wilson, MS. RD., per her Twitter bio , is a self-described “Queer. Black. Fat-positive dietitian.” She advertises her pronouns as “she/her.” (Article by Ben Bartee republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com) So we’re already off to a glorious start. Some background on this unique brand of hustle: two years ago, White House “nutrition advisor” Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, whom I exposed at the time as an industry hack funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Nestle, released a criminally wrong “ Food Compass ©” that ranked foods by their nutritional value, in which he concluded that Lucky Charms are actually much superior to chicken. Pseudoscientific nutrition advisers cloaking themselves in the auspices of Social Justice™ to peddle corporate propaganda has become a cottage industry. In a similar vein, Master’s Degree in Science Registered Dietician Jessica is now accusing advocates of whole food diets of “marginalizing” Persons of Color™, citing something called “food apartheid.” Via Time (emphasis added): “ Jessica Wilson is passionate about the pupusas from Costco . Not just because they’re tasty, but also because they’ve helped the California-based registered dietitian fight back against the mounting war on ultra-processed foods . It all started in the summer of 2023, when author and infectious-disease physician Dr. Chris van Tulleken was promoting his book, Ultra-Processed People. While writing it, van Tulleken spent a month eating mostly foods like chips, soda, bagged bread, frozen food, and cereal. “What happened to me is exactly what the research says would happen to everyone,” van Tulleken says: he felt worse, he gained weight, his hormone levels went crazy, and before-and-after MRI scans showed signs of changes in his brain. As van Tulleken saw it, the experiment highlighted the “terrible emergency” of society’s love affair with ultra-processed foods. Wilson, who specializes in working with clients from marginalized groups, was irked . She felt that van Tulleken’s experiment was over-sensationalized and that the news coverage of it shamed people who regularly eat processed foods—in other words, the vast majority of Americans, particularly the millions who are food insecure or have limited access to fresh food; they also tend to be lower income and people of color . Wilson felt the buzz ignored this “food apartheid,”* as well as the massive diversity of foods that can be considered ultra-processed: a category that includes everything from vegan meat replacements and nondairy milks to potato chips and candy. “How can this entire category of foods be something we’re supposed to avoid?” Wilson wondered .” *Never mind that “food apartheid,” if such a thing can be claimed to exist, is largely due to unchecked criminal activity in neighborhoods where no one with any sense would operate a retail establishment. As usual, any racism here is coming from the self-appointed champions of diversity: that BIPOCs are too stupid to understand what healthy foods are, or simply prefer eating garbage, so hence trying to explain healthy dietary habits to them in an effort to help them improve their lives would be patronizing and condescending — and, obviously, hateful. Continuing: “So she did her own experiment. Like van Tulleken, Wilson for a month got 80% of her daily calories from highly processed foods , not much more than the average American. She swapped her morning eggs for soy chorizo and replaced her thrown-together lunches—sometimes as simple as beans with avocado and hot sauce—with Trader Joe’s ready-to-eat tamales. She snacked on cashew-milk yogurt with jam. For dinner she’d have one of her beloved Costco pupusas, or maybe chicken sausage with veggies and Tater-Tots . She wasn’t subsisting on Fritos, but these were also decidedly not whole foods. A weird thing happened. Wilson found that she had more energy and less anxiety. She didn’t need as much coffee to get through the day and felt more motivated. She felt better eating an ultra-processed diet than she had before , a change she attributes to taking in more calories by eating full meals, instead of haphazard combinations of whole-food ingredients.” Note that van Tulleken backed up his assertion that binging on processed foods causes adverse health effects with some empirical data; bloodwork on hormones, MRI scans, etc. — which is backed up obviously by a cornucopia of publicly available research. There is no real argument here on the facts. On the other hand, diversity nutritionist Jessica reported that she “felt better,” which is good enough for TIME magazine.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-03-gluten-free-foods-loaded-glyphosate-agro-chemicals.html,"Food safety alert: Many gluten-free foods are contaminated with glyphosate and other agrochemicals, tests reveal","Recent tests on both organic and non-organic gluten-free food samples have produced disturbing results that could affect at least 20 million people who eat gluten-free food in the United States. Moms Across America tested 46 samples of gluten-free foods (including bread, pasta, crackers, snacks, flour, dessert mixes and chips) for glyphosate/AMPA, 236 pesticides, minerals and gluten. Approximately 600 million people worldwide avoid gluten, with many experiencing sensitivities and some having celiac disease, a condition that affects roughly one percent of the population. Celiac disease is an autoimmune system disorder that occurs when gluten – a protein found in barley, rye and wheat – is ingested. This condition can cause damage to the small intestine's lining, leading to various health issues and preventing the absorption of certain nutrients. The only effective way to manage celiac disease is by adhering to a gluten-free diet. Many people believe that gluten-free products are automatically healthier or safer , but these can actually be among the most misleadingly marketed and chemically contaminated foods on store shelves, according to the Health Ranger Mike Adams, author of ""Food Forensics: The hidden toxins lurking in your food and how you can avoid them for lifelong health."" (Related: Health Ranger Mike Adams warns of shocking levels of GLYPHOSATE weed killer in some organic foods .) Zen Honeycutt, director of Moms Across America, noted that the organization comprises a large , committed network of mothers dealing with health challenges, both mental and physical, in their families. The belief that foods labeled as "" clean "" are truly free of contaminants, including organic options, is increasingly being called into question . Honeycutt pointed out that many people who have been eating gluten-free and mostly organic foods for years are suffering from health issues like anxiety and digestive problems. Testing results and food quality concerns The tests, conducted by the Health Research Institute Laboratories found glyphosate residues in 44 out of 46 gluten-free food samples . Glyphosate, the primary chemical in Roundup herbicides, was the most frequently detected among nearly 240 pesticides screened. This weed killer was detected in nearly 96 percent of the samples at levels above 0.1 parts per billion, and 21 percent of the samples had levels higher than 10 ppb, which is the European Union's safety threshold for pesticide residues. Research suggests that even very low levels of glyphosate can affect gut health, disrupt hormones and have long-term health effects. (Related: Glyphosate warnings go mainstream as the dangerous truth about this toxic herbicide can no longer be denied .) The only two products without any detectable glyphosate were Lesser Evil Popcorn and Edward and Sons Rice Crackers. (Related: Glyphosate herbicide may be altering children's genetics and causing BIRTH DEFECTS .) In addition to glyphosate, all tested samples had pesticide residues – including piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a chemical flagged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a ""possible human carcinogen. "" Seven samples had only trace amounts, but 25 samples (54 percent) had measurable levels of another pesticide, 2,4-D. More troubling, the tests also showed that several products contained gluten levels above the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) maximum limit of 20 parts per million (ppm). The Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) has an even stricter threshold of 10 ppm. In the analysis by Moms Across America, three samples had gluten levels that exceeded 20 ppm. Further tests revealed that almost all samples had very low levels of essential nutrients, like calcium, iron and magnesium, which is very concerning. Honeycutt emphasized that when people buy gluten-free food, they are really paying for nutritional value, including necessary minerals. Yet many convenient and inexpensive foods, such as those served in schools and fast food, lack proper nutrition. She made it clear that while Moms Across America acknowledges that gluten-free manufacturers aim to produce safer and healthier foods, the challenge lies in the contaminated ingredients available due to the use of harmful agrochemicals. (Related: Glyphosate worse than we could imagine. ""It's everywhere."" ) Call for higher and stricter standards Moms Across America is now pushing for more stringent food regulations. Honeycutt emphasized the critical issue of contamination from glyphosate and other chemicals in foods intended for individuals with celiac disease and other conditions covered by the Americans with Disabilities. Honeycutt believes t his kind of contamination could be avoided . She thinks policymakers in the U.S. should ban the use of glyphosate and other chemicals as drying agents on crops. This change alone could eliminate up to 80 percent of glyphosate exposure through food. (Related: Glyphosate to be banned across Europe? Massive war raging, and poison-pushing Monsanto is playing dirty .) Honeycutt urged gluten-free food manufacturers to advocate for stricter regulations to protect consumers. She also criticized government agencies like the FDA, EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for failing to prioritize public health over corporate profits. According to Honeycutt, Moms Across America is committed to exposing the truth about food safety and pushing for changes that will create healthier communities.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-03-the-apoptotic-and-anticancer-effects-of-cinnamon.html,The apoptotic and anticancer effects of cinnamon,"Cancer rates are on the rise, and researchers are anxious to find possible alternative and herbal remedies to prevent and treat cancer. Conventional cancer treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both of which work to kill cancerous cells or arrest cancerous cell growth but have numerous negative side effects. [i] , [ii] (Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com ) However, a recent study published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry concluded that eugenol and cinnamaldehyde , two of the active ingredients in cinnamon, have powerful apoptotic properties that could be used to fight the growth and regeneration of cancerous cells. Researchers believe that cinnamon, widely used as a spice and flavoring agent, may be a possible preventative agent and treatment for cancer. Cinnamon's Apoptosis Effects Apoptosis is programmed cell death caused by biochemical changes, and it's a normal part of cellular growth and development. However, too much apoptosis can lead to dangerous conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease , while too little apoptosis can lead to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells ( cancer ). [iii] Cancerous cells are usually able to avoid apoptosis, allowing them to survive and grow rapidly. The pro-apoptotic activity of cinnamon makes it a potential inhibitory measure against cancer cell growth. [iv] Researchers have concluded that there are three ways in which an abnormal cell can suppress or avoid apoptosis, including: The impaired balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins A dysfunction in the ability of the cell to detect death receptor signaling Decreased caspase (an enzyme that initiates cellular death) activity Cinnamon contains two compounds that may regulate these apoptotic functions: 1. Eugenol One of cinnamon's active ingredients, eugenol both induces and regulates apoptosis in cancerous cells. Eugenol may also up-regulate the amount of caspase activity, further prompting appropriate cellular apoptosis. In this study, pre-treatment doses of eugenol resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the apoptotic index of cancerous cells. Finally, eugenol also works to mitigate any imbalances between the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. [v] [vi] 2. Cinnamaldehyde Similarly to eugenol, cinnamaldehyde is an organic compound that gives cinnamon its color, flavor and smell, up-regulates pro-apoptotic proteins and down-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins. This regulation of the balance of these important proteins gives cinnamaldehyde its anti-proliferative effects on cancerous cells. [vii] Cinnamon Suppresses Tumor Growth Of significant importance is cinnamon's ability to reduce tumor growth. Essential oil of cinnamon has been shown to suppress the growth of cell factors in carcinoma cells. [viii] Additionally, researchers found: ""Oral or intra-tumoral injection of [cinnamon extract] to a mouse melanoma model significantly reduced tumor growth after 22 days of therapy as determined by tumor weight measurement. [Cinnamon extract] suppressed metastasis occurrence by decreasing weight and dimension of spleen drainage and lymph nodes compared to the control."" [ix] As cancer prevalence becomes more widespread, researchers are excited at the possibility of using herbal or alternative medicinal treatments to treat and prevent cancer. That cinnamon contains such potent apoptotic and antitumor effects and is widely available is promising in the continued search for cancer treatment and prevention. Read more at: GreenMedInfo.com"

In a recent interview with Jillian Michaels of ""Keeping It Real,"" Dr. Hazan explained how the protocol she was using in her COVID patients, including a prominent hospital director who came to her seeking treatment, ended up getting her banned from posting anything on Facebook and Instagram because it went against the Biden regime's approved ""remedies,"" i.e., ""vaccines,"" face masking, and staying at home in fear. ""I couldn't advertise for my clinical trials,"" Dr. Hazan told Michaels about how Facebook and Instagram muzzled her after she was caught telling her followers about COVID remedies that work. ""I tried screaming it from the top of the roofs. No one died on my shift. Ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, vitamin C, and vitamin D: Those three protocols I was advertising like I would advertise anything, and what happened was we got censored.

Dr. Hazan says that after the fiasco with the COVID protocol advertising attempt, Meta simply cut her off entirely from posting anything on her social media accounts. She says she is perplexed about it because all she was promoting are common vitamins and time-tested drugs that are about as safe as it gets. ""These drugs are old,"" she explained. ""They are very safe, in my opinion. Ivermectin, we gave it to babies with scabies ... and doxycycline is given to young kids with acne for a year almost. All of a sudden that's dangerous?"" It became clear to Dr. Hazan after all this happened that entities much more powerful than Facebook, the government, and even the pharmaceutical industry must have been behind this blatant effort to keep people in the dark about COVID remedies that actually work. ""When we couldn't advertise on Facebook and Instagram, I knew this was bigger than pharma,"" she said. ""I knew this was bigger than health. And then when we couldn't talk about vitamin C and vitamin D and zinc – you couldn't even say to people, well, take vitamin C, take vitamin D. There were so many studies on vitamin D and we couldn't even discuss it."" Dr. Hazan also wants to go after the fake news media, lobbyists, politicians and anyone else who allowed this kind of censorship to take place.

Still, there is some damage that can be undone, or at least prevented from happening in the future, and that’s where the power of the Presidency of the United States comes in. The American people need representatives in government that care about the country, the citizens and the Constitution. Currently, we do not have fair and secure elections, as proven in court cases in several states, from videos from inside polling stations after hours, and from videos of people shoving massive amounts of ballots into drop boxes for the last POTUS election. Many politicians are arms dealers who run billion-dollar businesses that profit from war ( think Haliburton here ) and keep offshore accounts loaded from profits off the military industrial complex. This is well-documented through many wars over many decades. Politicians should not be able to profit from war because that’s just incentive to start them or participate (by proxy) in them. These crooks should be audited regularly by an independent, reliable accounting agency. Like no other time in history, vaccines are outright killing people within days, weeks, months. The mRNA jabs don’t even qualify under the definition of “vaccination,” because they involve tricking human cells into producing billions (possibly trillions with boosters) of toxic prions that travel throughout the vascular system, clogging and clotting, causing horrific health detriment to the victims of vaccine violence. These must be banned until proven safe and effective, if they can ever even do that (highly unlikely). Why federally subsidize foods that are scientifically known to cause obesity, diabetes and cancer, like genetically modified corn sugar and high fructose corn syrup? The U.S. government should subsidize foods that are high in nutritional value, so those products, produce, eggs and meats are more affordable and attractive to those who need to exchange their current junk-science consumption regimen for a healthy lifestyle. Anyone who was peacefully protesting on January 6 th at the Capital building in DC should be free from prison and should have never been sent there in the first place. Videos show DC police literally opening the Capital doors , holding them open for hundreds of people to walk by, and then escorting protesters through the Capital. Any ethical judge would have NEVER convicted these folks. Plus, they deserve to be compensated for all these years they’ve unjustly served in the DC gulags, not just released on the street like stray dogs. Here are 10 first actions Trump should take upon regaining the Presidency #1. Put mandatory serial numbers and anti-counterfeiting watermarks on all voting ballots, at all levels, just like cash money has now #2. Audit politicians involved in the Military Industrial Complex over past 4 years #3. Put RFK Jr. in charge of investigating vaccine safety and so-called “efficacy” and address mRNA first #4. Federally subsidize organic farms to make healthy food more affordable for everyone #5. Free all the January 6’ers and give them back pay for their jobs they had #6. Pardon all the whistleblowers the Biden Regime has prosecuted #7. Put the screws to Fauci and his CCP cohorts responsible for mass murder #8. Start a television news station that’s truth news 24/7/265, which Elon Musk could easily fund and help run, since he's worth a quarter trillion dollars #9.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-02-high-fluoride-levels-linked-lower-iq-children.html,Government report links high fluoride levels in drinking water to lower IQ in children,"A new report from the United States government titled ""Fluoride Exposure: Neurodevelopment and Cognition"" has revealed that exposure to high levels of fluoride from fluoridated drinking water is associated with lower IQ scores in children . The report has reignited the debate over fluoride in drinking water, revealing that exposure levels exceeding twice the recommended limit are linked to child's low IQ score. This is the first time a federal agency has confirmed with ""moderate confidence"" a connection between high fluoride levels and reduced cognitive function in kids. The report, released by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is based on a review of studies from several countries, including Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico. It highlights that drinking water with fluoride concentrations above 1.5 milligrams per liter is linked to a decrease in IQ. Some studies suggest a drop of two to five IQ points in children with higher fluoride exposure. (Related: COGNITIVE RETARDNATION: Fluoride exposure during pregnancy increases risk of neurodevelopmental issues in children .) Historically, fluoride has been praised for its role in preventing tooth decay. Since Grand Rapids, Michigan, first fluoridated its water in 1945 and federal endorsement in 1950, the practice has been seen as one of public health's greatest achievements. However, with the rise of fluoride toothpaste and increased scrutiny, health officials lowered the recommended fluoride levels in drinking water from 1.2 milligrams per liter to 0.7 milligrams in 2015 to address issues like dental fluorosis, which causes unsightly spots on teeth. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has long set a maximum fluoride limit of four milligrams per liter to prevent skeletal fluorosis, a condition that affects bone strength. However, emerging research has focused on potential neurological impacts, particularly concerning developing fetuses and young children exposed to formula mixed with fluoridated water. In 2006, the National Research Council (NRC) flagged the potential neurological effects of high fluoride levels – prompting calls for more research. The NTP's comprehensive review, which began in 2016, aimed to provide clarity on whether stricter fluoride limits are needed. The final report has faced delays but underscores the need for continued research and policy discussions. Millions of Americans living with excessive fluoride in water systems As the debate continues, the new report adds urgency to the discussion about fluoride's safety and impact on public health – particularly for vulnerable populations. University of Florida researcher Ashley Malin emphasized the importance of this report for understanding fluoride's risk. She said pregnant women should consider reducing fluoride intake, including from certain teas. According to government report, about 0.6 percent of Americans – nearly two million – are on water systems with naturally occurring fluoride levels of 1.5 milligrams or higher. ""The findings from this report raise the questions about how these people can be protected and what makes the most sense,"" said Malin. Malin noted that pregnant women living in these over-fluoridated areas need to immediately lower their fluoride intake not only from water but also from certain types of other food products like tea. Malin added that it is also necessary to have policy discussions about whether to require fluoride content labels on beverages.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-02-hundreds-of-doctors-resign-bma-child-mutilation.html,Hundreds of doctors resign from British Medical Association for its support of LGBT child mutilations,"The British Medical Association (BMA) recently came out to oppose an existing ban on puberty blockers for children in Great Britain, prompting hundreds of doctors in the United Kingdom to resign in protest and disgust. The physicians who called it quits from the BMA say the union is ignoring evidence-based medicine by continuing to support the grotesque and utterly perverted concept of ""changing genders"" by taking endocrine-disrupting pharmaceutical drugs that destroy a child's hormonal system, probably for life . It is all fun and games until all that drugging and mutilating catches up with a person, and yet BMA leadership think they know better than science and common sense what is safe and effective for a child suffering from gender dysphoria. The BMA wants the government of the U.K. to lift its puberty blockers for children ban, as well as pause the implementation of the National Health Service's Case Review. (Related: Did you know that the British Medical Journal [BMJ], which is run by the BMA, contends that unvaccinated people should be forced to get injected through targeted ""behavior interventions?"") ""Not in my name,"" disgusted doctors tell BMA Before this mass exodus, roughly 1,000 senior physicians from across the U.K. published an open letter to BMA chairman and professor Philip Banfield accusing him and the 69-member council that controls the direction of the BMA of passing this new union policy position at a ""secretive and opaque"" meeting. That open letter, which now has more than 1,400 senior physician signatures, 900 of which are from BMA members, calls out the doctors' union for basically doing its own thing without support from a majority of the union's members. ""We write as doctors to say, 'not in my name,'"" the letter states. ""We are extremely disappointed that the BMA council had passed a motion to conduct a 'critique' of the Cass Review and to lobby to oppose its recommendations ... It does not reflect the views of the wider membership, whose opinion you did not seek. We understand that no information will be released on the voting figures and how council members voted. That is a failure of accountability to members and is simply not acceptable."" Concerning the Cass Review, the letter goes on to call it ""the most comprehensive review into healthcare for children with gender related distress ever conducted."" Since the BMA has chosen to do nothing but attack the Cass Review, the signatories are now calling on the union to ""abandon its pointless exercise"" in opposing the review's recommendations. ""By lobbying against the best evidence we have, the BMA is going against the principles of evidence-based medicine and against ethical practice,"" the letter continues. Many of the comments on The Times in response to the letter are from people who claim to be doctors saying that they ""have torn up their membership cards"" in response to the BMA's official position in support of transgender child mutilation. ""As a union, primarily, it is the role of the BMA to represent its members, and not to drive clinical opinion, especially in specialist areas,"" one of them wrote. ""I am considering resigning after membership of 42 years."" ""I left the BMA partly because of this sort of behaviour on the part of the leadership, having been a member for some thirty years,"" said another. Many others used words like ""abysmal"" to describe the current leadership structure at the BMA, which is becoming ""increasingly bonkers and ideologically captured."" They also called for a ""vote of no confidence in BMA leadership"" to oust the current controllers of the union. LGBT child mutilation is one of the sickest perversions in existence and Western leaders are all about normalizing it. Learn more at Evil.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-02-kommie-harris-plans-xenophobic-racist-border-wall.html,Kommie Harris suddenly supports plan to build RACIST BORDER WALL that she said was un-American when Trump was building it,"High-profile Democrats love big walls around where they live, in their massive mansions worth millions of dollars, because the walls protect them from strangers who may want to rob them, assault them or traffic their children or grandchildren. These same top-level Democrat politicians spend tax-payer money to have lots of secret service protection everywhere they go, for all those same reasons. They worship their own wealth and safety, but they despise the very nation they live in. There’s proof in this accusation because they refuse to erect walls at the border and pay for proper security guards to keep out intruders, many of whom deal lethal drugs (think fentanyl, cocaine and heroin), traffic humans including children, assault, rob and rape Americans, take our jobs by working for much less (and for cash), and wash Conservative votes by voting (though they shouldn't) themselves for more free Democrat handouts, amnesty and slaps on the wrist for committing crimes. The bottom line is that the Democrat politicians in Washington DC right now, running the country into the ground, are complete and utter hypocrites, and will say anything to stay in power, including that they plan on rebuilding the Trump border wall that they tore down and sold for pennies on the dollar. Failed “Border Czar” Kommie Harris pretends now that she will rebuild the “Un-American” and “Stupid use of money” Trump U.S. southern-border wall Well, looks who’s xenophobic now. Can you call someone racist who’s half black and half Asian, or is that illegal in America? Does Kamilla the Hun hate Hispanics and South Americans? Why would she speak about building a wall that she already said was a complete waste of money, a stupid idea, and completely un-American? Well, because she wants to win an unwinnable election, that’s why. After helping Resident Biden let tens of millions of illegal immigrants wander right into America, and thus completely failing at the one job she was assigned to do for the past 4 years, now she’s flip-flopping and saying she plans to do everything Trump says he’s going to do and was doing during his term. This is the same woman who is an anti-2 nd Amendment extremist who wants to take away Americans’ guns so none of us can defend ourselves against the violent immigrant gangs, thieves, rapists and murderers she has let into the country. Recently, at the Democrat National Convention, Kommie Harris claimed she will sign a border security bill to continue building Trump’s border wall. Wait, what? Harris helped SHUT DOWN the U.S. government when she argued about how stupid the wall strategy was in 2019, but then most Democrats can’t remember what they stood for yesterday, so there’s that. So much for national emergencies being addressed under a communist dictator’s rule. She would rather spend billions on CRT, DEI and tranny boots (high heels) on the ground in proxy wars. She even has women being involuntarily signed up for a possible draft for a US-NATO instigated World War in 2025. The biggest xenophobe in the world is Commie Kommie right now, whose net worth is about 8 million dollars, and who claims to be afraid of dark-skinned folks walking into our country to live the American dream. So much for equity and the redistribution of America’s wealth to the poor and needy, huh? Will we still all “end up at the same place” with a “xenophobic” wall constructed across the U.S. border? Tune your apocalypse dial to Preparedness.news for updates on real news about the Trump border wall and securing the nation from the Democrat-Communist-funded invasion of criminals, mental cases and terrorists from around the world.

Their operations go hand-in-hand. The current supply of vaccines for children and adults is based on a history of brutality toward the unborn. In order to develop vaccines, human fetuses must be strategically picked apart, their organs harvested, the cell lines reproduced for vaccine manufacture. There are six main types of cell lines used to develop biologics (vaccines) . Four of these cell lines involve the sacrificial use of aborted fetal cells. The list of vaccines that exploit fetal cell lines in the manufacturing process is exhaustive. These aborted fetal cell lines include the WI-38 diploid human cell line , which is composed of fibroblasts taken from the lung tissue of a 3-month-gestation female fetus. Vaccines also utilize the HEK-293 cell line , which is isolated from the kidney of a human embryo. Third, vaccines contain the MRC-5 diploid cell line , which consists of fibroblasts isolated from the lung tissue of a white male, 14-week-old embryo. Finally, vaccines are derived from the RA 27/3 cell lines , which have been taken from attenuated fetal kidney cells since 1964. Here is the full list of vaccines that contain the WI-38 cell line: 1. MMR (M-M-R II) • Type: Live attenuated • Components: Measles, mumps, rubella 2. MMR (ProQuad) • Type: Live attenuated • Components: Measles, mumps, rubella, varicella 3. Varicella (Varivax) • Type: Live attenuated • Components: Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) 4. Zoster (Zostavax) • Type: Live attenuated • Components: Varicella-zoster virus (shingles) 5.

Hepatitis B (HEPLISAV-B) • Type: Recombinant • Components: Hepatitis B virus surface antigen Here is the full list of vaccines that contain the MRC-5 cell line: 1. MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) • Examples: MMR II (Merck), Priorix (GlaxoSmithKline) 2. Varicella Vaccine (Chickenpox) • Examples: Varivax (Merck), ProQuad (Merck, which combines MMR and varicella) 3. Hepatitis A Vaccine • Examples: Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline), Vaqta (Merck) 4. Rabies Vaccine • Examples: RabAvert (Pfizer), Imovax Rabies (Sanofi Pasteur) 5. Polio Vaccine (Inactivated Polio Vaccine, IPV) • Some IPV vaccines, like those produced by various manufacturers, might use MRC-5 cells in some production processes, though often Vero cells are used. 6. Shingles Vaccine (Herpes Zoster) • Examples: Zostavax (Merck, for older vaccine), Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline, primarily produced using insect cells, but initial strains may involve MRC-5) 7. Some Vaccines for Cancer Treatment • Examples: Certain experimental cancer vaccines and treatments might use MRC-5 cells. 8. Certain Influenza Vaccines • Some influenza vaccines might use MRC-5 cells in their production process, though this varies widely by manufacturer and formulation. Here is the full list of vaccines that contain the RA 27/3 cell line: 1. MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) • MMR II (Merck) • Priorix (GlaxoSmithKline) 2. MMRV Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella) • ProQuad (Merck) 3. Single Antigen Rubella Vaccine • Meruvax II (Merck) • MMR (Single Antigen) (Various brands in different countries) The current vaccine supply is fundamentally tainted with the blood of slain human beings. Products that are developed with morally controversial procedures should be re-evaluated and considered both unethical and unscientific. While these vaccine products remain on the market, a growing number of families are rejecting them based on religious grounds, and are invoking religious exemptions to vaccination for school, work and travel.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-01-un-and-who-coordinate-massive-polio-experiment-640000-displaced-palestinian-children.html,"UN and WHO coordinate massive POLIO vaccine experiment on 640,000 displaced Palestinian children","The United Nations, (UN) European Union, (EU) and World Health Organization (WHO) are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza – but they aren’t interested in ending the war and providing basic needs for Palestinians. Instead, these global entities are looking to exploit the 640,000 displaced, malnourished children – using them as experimental rats in a massive POLIO vaccine experiment. This polio vaccine experiment is designed to shed vaccine-derived polio strains , which are currently the most common form of polio circulating the globe. Worse, the mass vaccination program will cause provocation polio – crippling a certain percentage of the children and leaving their immune systems vulnerable to other infections. As the Palestinian communities collapse – with sewage, rubble and blood backing up into their drinking water – the only thing global governments can think up is a plan to round the children up and inoculate them! Forget that they are in survival mode, starving, injured and living in filth without access to nutrition or medical care. Even with healthcare facilities obliterated, the WHO is more interested in shooting kids up with vaccines Israeli’s military actions have had a devastating effect on Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure. Restrictions imposed by the Israeli military have severely crippled the territory’s healthcare system. Currently, only about a third of Gaza’s hospitals are operational, and 40 percent of primary healthcare facilities are functioning at minimal capacity. This has left many residents without access to essential medical services, exacerbating the already dire conditions. But not even these needs are the focal point. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has called for an “immediate 3-day humanitarian ceasefire” to get the children re-vaccinated. He demands access to Gaza ""independent of wider negotiations."" In response to the escalating humanitarian crisis, Israel has agreed to a temporary pause in the war to allow for the delivery of polio vaccines to Gaza. The vaccine shipment, which consists of 1.25 million doses, is intended to cover over half of Gaza’s population, including approximately 640,000 children. Israel, which has previously blocked food and medical aid to Gaza, will allow WHO and UNICEF to file into the streets and inoculate tens of thousands of children. This action is justified, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, because a 10-month-old infant in Deir al-Balah tested positive for the type 2 polio virus. It was the first polio case in Gaza since the mid-1990s. Global health authorities are taking this as an opportunity to move over a million vaccine units and re-vaccinate a population that is desperate and vulnerable for any global response. Child exploitation and population control, veiled as a humanitarian act The vaccination campaign is being carried out in cooperation with various organizations, including UNICEF, WHO, and UNRWA (the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees). Sam Rose, a senior official from the agency, acknowledged that the operation is expected to be highly challenging due to the ongoing conflict and the difficult conditions faced by both the health workers and the local population. The current focus on vaccination does not address the broader humanitarian crisis facing Gaza. The conflict has created an environment of extreme deprivation, with significant impacts on food security, sanitation and overall health. Many children in Gaza are suffering from malnutrition and compromised immune systems , making them more susceptible to infections and disease. Studies have shown that certain types of polio vaccines can lead to complications, including vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), particularly in environments with poor sanitation and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. Once this vaccine mission is complete in Gaza, Israel is expected to go back to bombing the region, as damaged immune systems, nervous systems and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis takes its toll. The vaccine campaign is a global act of virtue signaling that uses the Palestinian children as props. The vaccine campaign is really just child exploitation, a cold and calculated endeavor that ignores what the Palestinian children truly need, and it represents a veiled attempt at further population control.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-30-ivermectin-overcome-chemo-resistant-mrna-caused-cancers.html,Cancer researcher: IVERMECTIN can overcome chemotherapy resistance of TURBO CANCERS caused by mRNA vaccines,"An oncologist, cancer researcher and author recently shared a study that chemotherapy-resistant turbo cancers caused by Pfizer and Moderna Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines can be overcome by ivermectin, a controversial anti-parasitic drug known to ease symptoms of viruses such as coronavirus. Health authorities have been debunking this information and have not authorized or approved its use in humans for this purpose. In a Substack newsletter, Dr. William Makis cited a paper from 2020 (by Juarez et al) on the antitumor effects of ivermectin at clinically feasible concentrations where it was found to support its clinical development as a repositioned cancer drug. According to the study, at a human dose of two mg/kg, ivermectin can achieve anti-cancer effects such as cell cycle arrest (inhibit proliferation), preferential inhibition of cancer stem-like cells, synergize with several chemotherapy drugs and inhibit tumor growth in a breast cancer mouse model. Ivermectin was tested at two mg/kg/day, translating to roughly 5uM in vitro concentration. They found that the drug goes after cancer stem cells, which tend to be resistant to chemotherapy. ""Ivermectin has a preferential depletion effect on the cancer stem-like cell population,"" the authors included in the research. ""We observed that among all the evaluated cell lines, a decrease in cell viability and clonogenicity is more evident in the cancer stem-like cells than in their parental population."" It also found that the most sensitive cancer cell lines were the ovarian, breast, glioblastoma (brain), lung, colon, uterine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), hepatocellular, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic and endometrial. Meanwhile, the least sensitive were osteosarcoma, gastric and melanoma. Moreover, lymphoma and leukemia cell lines appear to be more resistant to Ivermectin but the drug has a significant impact on those cells' ability to form colonies, according to the study. (Related: Ivermectin can ""kill cancer cells"" and boost immune response, suggest health experts .) Makis further highlighted that this was the first study he had ever seen that had tested as many as 28 cancer types with ivermectin. ""No wonder it's hidden from the public,"" he commented.

One of the pages that the agency has removed was a page that said: ""Should I take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19 ? No."" It also took down posts, including one that reads: ""You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it."" The move was done following a lawsuit with a settlement filed with a federal court in Texas that ordered the agency to delete another page titled ""Why you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 within 21 days."" The article said that ivermectin was neither authorized nor approved to be used to prevent or treat COVID-19 in humans or animals. It also claims that evidence does not support the efficacy of ivermectin against coronavirus. On June 2, 2022, Doctors Paul Marik, Mary Talley Bowden and Robert Apter filed a lawsuit against the FDA and its secretary Robert Califf, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services and its secretary Xavier Becerra. They accused the FDA of meddling with their capacity to practice medicine. The lawsuit was first turned down on the basis that the FDA has ""sovereign immunity."" However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overruled the lower court's ruling, stating that the ""FDA is not a physician"" and ""even tweet-sized doses of personalized medical advice are beyond the FDA's statutory authority."" Ivermectin has long been approved for use in both animals and humans. In cases of humans, the drug is recommended to treat parasitic infections such as river blindness disease, threadworm infestation, tropical eosinophilia, roundworm infestation, whipworm infestation, filariasis (also called elephantiasis) and loiasis. On X, formerly Twitter, Dr. Mary Talley Bowden wrote: ""This landmark case sets an important precedent in limiting FDA overreach into the doctor-patient relationship."" Moreover, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr in a tweet said: ""The FDA is biased against many low-cost, generic, and/or natural therapies with low-profit potential.

In March, Derek Reimer, a pastor at Mission 7 Ministries, a Christian organization that focuses on outreach to homeless people in Calgary, Alberta confronted a library manager at the Calgary Public Library for hosting a drag queen event for children. Reimer, known for his outspoken opposition to drag queen story hours and other LGBT events, also posted a video of the interaction on Facebook, stating his intention to return to protest if the event continued. This, in turn, has found Reimer guilty of criminal harassment. ""A judge found me guilty today of criminal harassment for expressing my opposition towards drag queen story hour to a library manager set on hosting the event. For posting the video of our interaction on Facebook, and saying we'll be back [to protest] if the event continues,"" Reimer said in a message sent to LifeSiteNews . ""This charge is punishable up to two years, and I will be posting the sentencing date soon."" (Related: Canadian pastors being arrested for preaching the Gospel while broadcasters remain free to exploit “drag” children to advance LGBT agenda .) Justice Karen Molle of the Alberta Court of Justice acquitted Reimer on public disturbance charges for using a loudspeaker to protest outside two separate drag story events. Molle ruled that such actions did not constitute a criminal offense. Reimer was also found guilty of four counts of breaching his bail conditions, which banned him from protesting outside ""drag queen story time"" events and being within 300 meters of any LGBTQ event in Calgary. His lawyer, Andrew MacKenzie, noted that an appeal of the ruling is possible. Reimer remains free on bail for now. Calgary enacted pro-LBGT bylaws to suppress pastors and parents from protesting Reimer has been arrested multiple times for his activism, which resulted in repeated legal troubles. This happened since the Calgary City Council enacted a new bylaw in March 2023 to prevent protests against drag queen storytime events and other LGBTQ events at public facilities. The ""Safe and Inclusive Access Bylaw"" establishes a 100-meter buffer zone around all city-owned and affiliated public buildings. This prohibits ""specified protests"" both inside and outside these spaces. This means that protests against LGBTQ events, including drag queen story times, are now banned within a 100-meter radius of city recreation centers, libraries and other public facilities. The ban extends to protests by individuals or groups, including pastors and concerned parents, who have been vocal against what they see as ""radical LGBTQ events"" in public spaces. Violators of the new regulations could face significant penalties, including fines of up to CA$10,000 ($7,430) or up to one year in jail. The bylaw, which went into effect immediately, did not include the usual committee review or public consultation process. That same month, the city council also voted to amend the street harassment bylaw and include the term ""intimidation"" to address protesters disrupting drag queen storytime events.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-30-adding-honey-yogurt-help-improve-gut-health.html,Studies show that adding HONEY to YOGURT can help improve your gut health,"Honey and yogurt provide health benefits when eaten by themselves, but two studies have shown that combining both can help improve your gut health . The first study published March 3 in the Journal of Nutrition (JoN) simulated how Bifidobacterium animalis , a bacterium found in yogurt, survives in the gut when honey is added. Various kinds of honey (alfalfa, buckwheat, clover and orange blossom) were mixed with yogurt and subjected to simulated digestion. It found that adding clover honey – around one to two tablespoons per 170 grams of yogurt – helped B. animalis survive exposure to digestive juices. Clover honey is produced by bees that collect nectar from clover ( Trifolium ) flowers. Meanwhile, the second study also published in JoN in August involved two randomized clinical trials (RCT), with the first one having 66 participants. The participants were then divided into two groups, with one consuming the yogurt-honey combination and the other group consuming heat-treated yogurt with sugar added in. The first RCT found that consuming yogurt with clover honey helped maintain probiotics in the gut. However, it did not affect bowel habits or mood, likely due to the study participants' already healthy habits. A subsequent smaller RCT with 36 participants found that yogurt with honey retained the highest level of probiotics compared to yogurt with sugar. There were no notable effects on health metrics, however. Dr. Hannah Hoischer from the University of Illinois , the corresponding author for both studies, said the research team investigated this pairing and noted its common use in Mediterranean diets and its impact on gut health. ""The enzymes in our mouth, stomach and intestines help with digestion and facilitate nutrient absorption, but they also reduce the viability of microbes. That's great when it's pathogens, but not necessarily when it comes to beneficial bacteria,"" she said in a statement. ""We wanted to see if honey could help probiotic bacteria survive in the gut . Our findings showed that pairing honey with yogurt supported the survival of the yogurt's probiotic bacteria in the gut, so the lab study results did translate to real-world application in humans."" Benefits of adding honey to yogurt Combining honey with yogurt creates a powerful duo for boosting your digestive health and overall well-being. Both honey and yogurt offer distinct health benefits and enhance your immunity and support healthy digestion. (Related: A healthy gut means a healthy body – but how does it work ?) For best results, choose plain, unsweetened yogurt to keep sugar and calorie intake low, with Greek yogurt being a top choice . Opt for raw, organic honey for its higher antioxidant levels. Here's how this tasty combination benefits you: Provides essential nutrients Honey and yogurt are antioxidant and nutrient powerhouses. Raw honey is rich in amino acids, antioxidants (flavonoids and polyphenols), enzymes, minerals (calcium. iron, phosphorus, potassium and zinc) and B complex vitamins B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin) and B6 (pyridoxine). Yogurt, on the other hand, provides essential nutrients, including minerals (calcium, iodine, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, selenium and zinc), probiotic compounds and B vitamins B2 (riboflavin), B5 (pantothenic acid) and B12 (cobalamin). Supports heart health Honey's antioxidants can help lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels and regulate your heart rate–reducing heart disease risk. Yogurt supports heart health by providing potassium and probiotics that can lower bad cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Supports digestive health Honey has antibacterial and antifungal properties that aid in treating gastrointestinal issues. Yogurt's probiotics enhance gut health by improving the balance of bacteria, which can help with digestion and conditions like constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Regulates blood sugar Honey may help lower LDL or bad cholesterol and inflammation without drastically raising blood sugar levels. With nutrient absorption benefits, yogurt can support healthy blood sugar regulation and potentially lower type 2 diabetes risk. Supports immune system Honey's antioxidants reduce inflammation and oxidative stress–boosting immunity. Yogurt's probiotics strengthen the immune system by maintaining a healthy gut microbiota environment. Enjoy this combination in moderation for optimal health benefits. You can also elevate your yogurt bowl with more than just a small amount of honey . Try adding nuts or nut butter for extra healthy fats and protein or toss in your favorite fruits to boost fiber and additional antioxidants. No matter what mix you pick, savor the gut health benefits that a touch of honey brings to your yogurt .

Dr. Jonathan LaPook, the chief medical correspondent for CBS News , said Fauci ""was hospitalized nearly 10 days ago after showing symptoms including fever, chills and severe fatigue."" The CBS News correspondent added that Fauci himself surmised that he was likely infected from a mosquito bite he got in his backyard. According to the AP , WNV is primarily transmitted through infected mosquito bites. Around one in five persons infected experience symptoms like fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or rashes. Around one in 150 meanwhile, develop serious and potentially fatal conditions. There are no vaccines or specific treatments for WNV, but avoiding mosquito bites appears to be the best measure to prevent infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported 216 WNV cases across 33 states as of Aug. 20, per the AP . The news of the 83-year-old Fauci's hospitalization after being infected with WNV followed almost a month after he admitted to testing positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a third time. He made this admission during a July 30 interview with Dr. Jeremy Faust, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today . ""I got infected about two weeks ago,"" said Fauci, the former director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""It was my third COVID-19 infection, and I had been vaccinated and boosted a total of six times."" (Related: Fauci tests positive for COVID-19 a third time despite being VACCINATED 6 TIMES. ) WNV not the only mosquito-borne disease making a resurgence It appears that WNV is not the only mosquito-borne disease making a resurgence as of late. The Daily Mail reported that a city in Massachusetts has set an outdoor curfew for residents after a person contracted a reportedly rare illness transmitted by insects. Health authorities in Oxford, Massachusetts – located about 50 miles southwest of Boston – announced the curfew following a resident being struck with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). According to the Mail , the curfew aims to reduce the risk of residents being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the EEE virus. EEE causes fever and brain swelling in those infected and can lead to seizures and comas. A third of people infected die, and those who recover often suffer from lifelong physical and mental disabilities. The Bay State reported 12 cases and six deaths from EEE in 2019. The following year, five EEE cases and one death were reported there. The state did not report any cases and deaths between 2021 and 2023, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health . The Oxford Board of Health issued an advisory outlining tips to prevent contracting EEE. It recommended wearing long sleeves and long pants, applying insect repellent and avoiding peak mosquito hours from sunset until sunrise. The advisory also urged residents to avoid the collection of clean, stagnant water due to the latter being breeding grounds for mosquitoes. But looking at this deeply, the timing of Fauci's reported hospitalization for WNV and the EEE case in Massachusetts appears to be pushing some sinister agenda. It is worth noting that the resurgence of mosquito-based diseases, alongside the World Health Organization 's monkeypox declaration, occurs just months before Americans head to polling places in November.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-30-continuous-aerobic-training-most-effective-managing-diabetes.html,Study: Continuous aerobic training confirmed to be the MOST EFFECTIVE exercise for diabetes management,"A new study emphasizes the importance of selecting the right type of exercise to help people with Type 1 diabetes maintain both blood sugar levels and cardiovascular health, which is essential for managing the condition effectively. The research, published in the American Journal of Cardiology , indicates that consistently participating in continuous aerobic training might be the most effective approach for enhancing blood sugar control in those with Type 1 diabetes, particularly female patients. ""This study is important because diabetic patients often lack motivation to exercise as a means of managing their condition,"" noted study co-author Dr. Pooya Soltani, a senior lecturer at Staffordshire University in Stroke-on-Trent, England. ""One reason for this is that physical activity can lead to blood sugar drops, causing discomfort and demotivation. We investigated whether the type of physical activity could mitigate these blood sugar drops ."" The study focused on 19 adults with Type 1 diabetes who were not in the habit of exercising regularly. Participants took part in two different 30-minute exercise sessions on separate days. One session involved continuous, steady exercise, while the other consisted of interval training with alternating high and low intensity. Using a crossover design, each participant experienced both types of exercise – allowing for a direct comparison of individual responses to each type. The researchers measured blood sugar levels with a finger-prick test and recorded blood pressure, heart rate, perceived exertion and enjoyment at three different points during each session – before starting, right after finishing, and 20 minutes afterward. They then applied statistical methods to analyze differences in responses between men and women, different exercise types, and various time points. The study demonstrated that continuous exercise, such as maintaining a steady, moderate pace like jogging for 30 minutes, led to greater reductions in blood sugar levels compared to interval training. Interval training, which involves alternating between higher and lower intensity activities like switching between jogging and walking, also showed some positive effects although these were less pronounced. Interestingly, the study also highlighted gender-specific differences in how exercise impacted blood sugar levels. Women experienced more stable blood sugar control overall, with significant reductions, primarily after continuous exercise. In contrast, men had larger drops in blood sugar following both types of exercise but the most notable decreases occurred after continuous sessions. These findings suggest that continuous exercise is advantageous for managing blood sugar in both men and women, but men may need to be particularly cautious about monitoring their levels to avoid excessive drops. Despite the differences in blood sugar responses, both men and women reported similar levels of effort and enjoyment for both exercise types. This suggests that both continuous aerobic training and interval training could be enjoyable and effective options for people with Type 1 diabetes – allowing them to choose based on personal preference and blood sugar management goals. Exercise should be personalized based on needs and abilities Overall, these findings offer valuable guidance for health care professionals and those living with Type 1 diabetes. ""Our study showed that for male patients, interval exercise like short bursts of walking is preferable when starting with low blood sugar levels. Conversely, continuous exercise like running is more suitable for those with higher initial blood sugar levels. These approaches can help prevent sudden blood sugar drops,"" said Dr. Jorge Luiz de Brito-Gomes of the Federal University of Vale do Sao Francisco in Brazil. ""For female patients, both interval and continuous aerobic training appear to be effective starting points,"" added De Brito-Gomes. ""We hope these findings show that gender-specific recommendations should be considered for aerobic exercise prescription, especially for men with irregular physical activity levels."" Although continuous aerobic training seems to be more effective at controlling or regulating blood sugar, particularly for women, researchers note that the ideal type of exercise should still be personalized to match each individual's preference, blood sugar control needs and ability to manage their blood sugar levels during and after physical activity.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-recycled-plastics-a-nightmare-concoction-bpa-phthalates.html,"Recycled plastics are a nightmare concoction of BPA and phthalates, but recycling makes a great cover story for “greenwashing” the plastics industry","Keeping plastic bottles out of the landfills and waterways is a conscious, sustainable pursuit; however, these plastic chemicals are often recycled into new packaging materials, creating an unknown blend of synthetic chemicals that leech into the food supply, harming human health. While trying to protect the environment, we may inadvertently be harming ourselves, and the regulatory agencies are asleep at the wheel on the issue . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing mounting criticism over its lack of oversight concerning the recycled plastics that are used in new food packaging. Researchers warn that chemical companies are practically regulating themselves, incorporating a nightmare concoction of phthalates and BPA into recycled plastics. Unknown combinations of synthetic chemicals are being intermixed into new food packaging materials, ensuring that the current food supply is full of endocrine-disrupting carcinogens. To make matters worse, the FDA's approval process does not adequately safeguard against the potential risks of toxic chemicals leaching into food products. FDA’s review of recycled plastics is a voluntary process that allows companies to do whatever they want Since the early 1990s, the FDA has approved over 340 voluntary applications for food contact materials made from recycled plastics, with the number of approvals increasing significantly in recent years. Approvals for recycled plastic products have tripled since 2019, going from 7-8 approvals per year prior to 2019 to an average of 23 approvals per year since. For example, major companies like Coca-Cola and General Mills have adopted recycled plastics for their products, including Coca-Cola’s 100% recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles and General Mills' Annie’s cereal boxes with 35% recycled plastic liners. Companies that seek approvals include some of the biggest petrochemical companies around, including Eastman Chemicals, DuPont and Indorama. These manufacturers, along with companies from India and China, exert significant influence over regulators, especially when so much money is put into plastic recycling in the first place. Moving new products in the cheapest recycled plastic is the ultimate goal, as companies want to appear sustainable, while reaping max profits. This is why the FDA’s approval process for these materials has been criticized for its lack of rigor and transparency. Unlike other regulatory processes, the FDA’s review of recycled plastics is voluntary, meaning companies are not required to submit comprehensive safety data or undergo mandatory testing unless they choose to. The FDA’s reliance on industry-provided data is insufficient for identifying potential health hazards. Recycled plastics are a BPA and phthalate nightmare Researchers have pointed out that recycled plastics may contain a cocktail of toxic chemicals that may leach into food products. Studies indicate that recycled PET, commonly used in bottles, can harbor substances like bisphenol-A (BPA) , phthalates and other hazardous chemicals at higher levels than virgin PET. These substances are linked to various health issues, including endocrine disruption, cancer and developmental problems. Dr. Maricel Maffini, a scientist with Environmental Health News, argues that the FDA’s approach to approving recycled plastics is “very lax.” The agency primarily concerns itself with pathogen contamination rather than the complex chemical mixtures present in recycled materials. The recycling process itself introduces additional complexities. Recycled plastics are often collected from mixed sources, including potentially hazardous items like pesticide containers. Furthermore, the degradation of plastics during recycling may necessitate the addition of stabilizers and other chemicals, increasing the risk of harmful substances leaching into food. FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges, defends the agency’s review process for having “stringent scientific guidelines” and says the agency has the capability to conduct spot tests if necessary. However, Professor Tom Zoeller from the University of Massachusetts Amherst says the FDA’s approach is outdated, noting that its safety standards are based on evaluating single chemicals rather than the complex mixtures found in recycled plastics . Zoeller and others suggest that the FDA should adopt more modern testing methodologies that consider endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the cumulative effects of chemical exposures.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-ucla-medical-students-woke-health-equity-curriculum.html,CAMPUS INSANITY: UCLA enlists medical students to help craft “woke” health equity curriculum,"The University of California, Los Angeles's (UCLA) medical school is coming under fire after enlisting first- and second-year medical students to help design a new, more liberal curriculum for its mandatory Structural Racism and Health Equity (SRHE) courses. A document from June 2023, obtained by the advocacy group Do No Harm, reveals that UCLA is looking to involve these students in creating a curriculum that includes themes associated with critical race theory and other liberal and so-called ""woke"" perspectives. According to the SRHE curriculum guide, the course will focus on how structural determinants of health, such as race, influence the current healthcare system. The curriculum emphasizes critical race theory, queer theory and principles of diversity, equity and inclusion . To apply for this role, students must provide a letter of support from a peer demonstrating their commitment to anti-racist efforts. (Related: Trump vows to cut federal funding for schools pushing CRITICAL RACE THEORY and transgenderism .) Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, chairman of Do No Harm, criticized UCLA's approach, telling the Washington Examiner that having first-year students develop curriculum content is problematic. He argued that these students, who often have limited clinical experience, are not suitable candidates for such responsibilities. Medical education being infested by woke ideology The rise of ""woke"" ideology in medical education across the United States is raising significant concerns. Traditionally, one of the few universally shared experiences in life is visiting a doctor. When seeking medical care, patients naturally desire the most knowledgeable and skilled physician available. However, medical schools seem to be shifting their focus from producing top-notch doctors to cultivating those who adhere to equitable and ""woke"" principles . This shift has profound implications for the future of healthcare. The event featured Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute; Aaron Sibarium, associate editor at the Washington Free Beacon ; and John Sailer, a research associate at NAS and author on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education. While social factors can affect health, they are not the sole determinants. Personal choices also play a crucial role, yet the focus has increasingly shifted to a victimhood narrative that diminishes personal responsibility. This is the argument presented by Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, during a webinar hosted by the National Association of Scholars (NAS) in February. Satel also talks about how woke ideology and an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) has impacted the field of psychiatry, making psychotherapy ineffective for people who believe they are simply oppressed victims and not people who can recognize and address how their actions may be hindering their well-being. Satel also critiqued organizations like ""White Coats for Black Lives,"" which prioritize social activism over patient care, advocating for the dismantling of racism in healthcare rather than focusing on medical treatment. John Sailer, a research associate with NAS and an author on and critic of DEI, highlighted how institutional policies are contributing to the rise of wokeness in medical schools, leading to universities spending far too much to employ so-called ""DEI officers"" who dedicate their time at work to integrating so-called social justice into medical education. DEI and social justice principles are increasingly influencing tenure and promotion processes at medical schools. This shift can jeopardize faculty positions for those who dissent from prevailing ideologies, even on matters of basic scientific truth. Sailer also discussed the radical beliefs of groups like White Coats for Black Lives, which advocate for a range of progressive causes including the abolition of prisons and capitalism. These groups have successfully implemented policy changes at institutions such as the University of Michigan and the University of California, Davis .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-childhood-vaccines-disruption-cellular-metabolism-cancer-kids.html,"Childhood vaccines are linked to disruption of cellular metabolism, which could cause cancer in kids","Since the 1990s, when vaccination schedules for children started getting mandated by governments, childhood cancers have skyrocketed . Experts attributed the direct correlation of the toxic ingredients in the vaccines to the disruption of cellular metabolism that could eventually cause cancer in kids. Cancer in kids has increased by 40 percent over the past 16 years, according to a 2016 article by the U.K.'s The Telegraph. Cases among infants and toddlers have continued to climb since then. ""For American children ages one through 14, cancer is the top disease-related cause of death, second only to accidents among all causes of childhood mortality. Leukemia and malignancies of the central nervous system are the most common types of childhood cancers,"" Children's Health Defense previously reported. In a recent post on X, outspoken anti-vaccine activist Dr. Sherri Tenpenny shared an article by Paul Louis about this topic. According to the article, Nobel Prize-winning German biochemist Otto Warburg discovered before 1930 that cellular oxygen insufficiency results in a metabolic shift, where cells resort to fermenting glucose for energy instead of using oxygen to metabolize glucose and other nutrients. The said conversion is a cell's survival mechanism but the cells survive as cancer. Warburg also postulated that cancer is a metabolic disease , confronting the unproven theory of mainstream oncology that claims cancer is the result of genetic mutations. The scientist explained that within each cell are tiny organelles called mitochondria that use oxygen respiration to metabolize nutrients to release adenosine triphosphate. This basic fuel provides the body's energy. When corrupted due to toxins and heavy metals, mitochondrial disorders occur. The cell's powerhouse also plays a role in cell death called apoptosis. When the elimination of old or damaged cells and replacement with new cells are hampered, the mitochondria are damaged. If a cell never dies, it becomes an ""immortal cell"" or cancer. Meanwhile, retired physician Dr. Gary G. Kohls revealed that common iatrogenic (drug or doctor-caused) diseases can be caused by commonly prescribed drugs and/or commonly injected vaccine ingredients, which are making many of us highly drugged, malnourished, environmentally toxic and also thoroughly vaccinated. Moreover, in 2017, a study published on Frontiers in Oncology discussed how mitochondrial dysfunction leads to cancer tumors . The research circles back to Warburg's findings from decades ago. Toxic ingredients in vaccines that could cause cancer Vaccines are made more ""efficient"" by adjuvants and preservatives known to be highly toxic when injected into humans and these toxins are inoculated into kids' immune systems that are not fully developed yet. These toxins directly corrupt the DNA of mitochondria . One chemical said to be included in the injections is formaldehyde, an embalming fluid used to preserve dead bodies. It is claimed to minimize bacterial infections held by corrupted antigens. But it is a known carcinogen. Until 2004, most childhood vaccines contained thimerosal. Since then, thimerosal has been removed from most childhood vaccines ""as a precaution,"" although the vaccine industry and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still maintain the mercury injected into children and adults is safe. Lastly, aluminum is used in almost all vaccines as an adjuvant for boosting an antibody response from its viral or bacterial antigen. The pharmaceutical industry measures vaccine efficacy by its antibody response. However, it does not guarantee protection against any infection as natural immunity comes from human contact with the pathogens or contracting the illness and recovering from it. The lightweight silvery-white element is a known neurotoxin that could easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. A 2018 study determined infants receive 17 times more aluminum than would be allowed if doses were adjusted per body weight during the first days of their lives. Some vaccine ingredients, such as formaldehyde, are independently carcinogenic. Even though the role of defective mitochondria in cancer development has been intensely debated for years, current science is providing direct evidence to support the theory that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to cancer as initially proposed by Warburg.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-studies-suggest-nutrients-can-lower-dementia-risk.html,Studies suggest these nutrients can help lower your dementia risk,"Dementia is a general term used to describe cognitive symptoms commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These symptoms include loss of memory, language, problem-solving skills and other cognitive abilities. Dementia symptoms are triggered by abnormal changes in the brain and also affect feelings, behavior, relationships and one's ability to function in everyday life. According to research, the main cause of dementia is damage to brain cells. Damaged cells cannot send signals and communicate with each other, disrupting cognitive processes such as thinking and emotional regulation. Because the brain has many distinct regions each with its own specific function (e.g., memory, judgment, movement, etc.), dementia symptoms vary depending on which brain region's cells are damaged. Multiple risk factors are said to contribute to the development of dementia. A study published in the journal Nutrients noted that while some factors, such as genetics, advanced age and family history , cannot be modified, other factors are modifiable. In 2017, a panel of experts identified nine modifiable risk factors of dementia, namely, depression, diabetes, hearing impairment, hypertension, low social contact, obesity, physical inactivity, poor education and smoking. In 2020, experts updated this list to include air pollution, excessive alcohol consumption and traumatic brain injury. But more recently, researchers have begun exploring the role of diet and nutrient deficiencies in triggering the development of dementia. Subsequently, experts have begun to recognize the importance of nutrient supplementation as a possible solution to prevent cognitive decline . (Related: Dementia or something else? See which health conditions that are often mistaken for the degenerative disease .) Link between nutrition and dementia Preclinical studies have shown that certain nutrients can help modulate brain aging . Some of the most important brain nutrients identified by researchers include B vitamins (B6, B9 and B12), vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and plant-derived nutrients (phytonutrients) with antioxidant properties, such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Because nutrients normally interact with other nutrients inside the body, multiple-nutrient supplementation, particularly of the aforementioned nutrients, appear to work significantly better than single-nutrient supplementation. In a new study published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia , a team of American and Dutch researchers attempted to shed more light on the ""complex interactions between multiple-nutrient suboptimal statuses and cognitive aging ."" To achieve their objective, they developed a nutrient status index that includes three nutrient biomarkers, namely, homocysteine (for vitamins B6, B9 and B12), vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. They then associated this index with the incidence of dementia in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, a prospective community-based cohort. Among the 968 study participants, the researchers reported that 79 developed dementia over a median follow-up of 15.5 years. They also found that concurrent nutrient deficiencies are associated with dementia risk. Participants with a higher index, which meant suboptimal homocysteine, vitamin D and omega-3 status, had a higher risk of developing dementia than participants with a lower index. A combined suboptimal status for B vitamins, vitamin D and omega-3s was also associated with a four-fold increase in dementia risk. (Related: Research shows Lion’s mane mushroom can combat dementia and cognitive decline .) In addition, the researchers found that being a carrier of the APOE ?4 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease , influenced the association between nutrient status index and dementia risk. They noted that while being a smoker and having diabetes doubled the dementia risk of participants, having the APOE ?4 allele tripled their risk. Prompted by these findings, the researchers emphasized the importance of dietary interventions coupled with dietary supplementation to address nutrient deficiencies and lower one's risk of developing dementia. Nutrients for a healthy brain As mentioned in the study, having healthy levels of B vitamins, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids is important for maintaining healthy brain functions as you age. This is because these nutrients play distinctive roles in the process of brain aging. Brain aging, according to studies, occurs through multiple, dynamically interacting mechanisms that require the involvement of the abovementioned nutrients. Vitamin D is an important nutrient not just for supporting brain health but also for maintaining strong bones and teeth and a robust immune system . Research suggests that vitamin D promotes healthy brain aging because it helps reduce oxidative stress and brain inflammation, regulates calcium homeostasis and suppresses amyloid beta deposition. The deposition of amyloid beta is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease . In a recent study, researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts looked at four regions of the human brain that are associated with changes linked to Alzheimer's disease. They found that vitamin D is present in all four brain regions and that individuals with high vitamin D concentrations in those regions have better cognitive functions than those with lower concentrations. (Related: Vitamin D supplementation found to prevent decline in memory and learning, research finds .) Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is naturally produced by the human body , specifically in the skin, upon exposure to ultraviolet B rays from the sun. To maintain healthy vitamin D levels, experts suggest exposing your skin to the sun for at least 13 minutes around midday every day. You can also include fatty fish (e.g., salmon and sardines) and fish liver oils in your diet as well as egg yolks, cheese and beef liver. Omega-3 fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to support cardiovascular health. The omega-3s you get from food are actually incorporated into the cell membranes of all tissues in your body. Enrichment of these membranes with omega-3s is said to result in better cell signaling or communication, membrane protein function and gene expression . According to studies, lipids comprise approximately 50 to 60 percent of the brain's weight , and about 35 percent of these lipids are omega-3s. Of the three main types of omega-3s -- docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) -- DHA accounts for more than 40 percent of the total omega-3s in brain cells. Omega-3s support healthy cognition by promoting optimal brain cell function and protecting brain cells from neurodegeneration. The best sources of DHA and EPA are fatty fish like mackerel, salmon, herring, sardines and anchovies. Oysters also contain decent amounts of omega-3s. Plant-based foods like flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts and soybeans, on the other hand, are excellent sources of ALA. ALA can be converted by the body to DHA. Studies also show that ALA could help protect against Alzheimer's disease by improving blood-brain barrier function. B vitamins are water-soluble nutrients that play crucial roles in various metabolic processes . Because they cannot be stored by the body, you need to get them daily from the foods you eat. Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, in particular, are involved in the production of chemicals that help regulate brain processes , which is why maintaining healthy levels of these nutrients is extremely important. In fact, having low levels of these vitamins is linked not only to cognitive decline but also to depression. According to a meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrition Reviews , long-term B vitamin supplementation can help slow cognitive decline among healthy older adults. They also noted that in non-dementia populations, lower vitamin B9 (folate) levels and higher homocysteine levels were associated with higher risks of dementia and cognitive decline. Among adults 50 years and above, higher intake of folate significantly decreased dementia risk, suggesting a potential role for this nutrient in dementia prevention. (Related: Study reveals B VITAMINS may reduce glaucoma risk .) Vitamin B6 can be found in a variety of foods , such as pork, poultry, peanuts, soybeans, oats, bananas and milk. Vitamin B9 can be found in abundance in dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, poultry, meat and whole grains. Vitamin B12 can be obtained from organ meats, clams, sardines, beef, milk and dairy products, eggs and oily fish like salmon and trout. Nutrition plays a huge role in the maintenance of healthy brain functions. For healthy brain aging, eat a well-balanced diet rich in nutritious foods and seek guidance from a health professional about taking dietary supplements to help meet your nutritional needs.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-the-globalists-plan-to-enslave-the-world.html,When did the globalists’ plan to enslave the world using chronic illness begin?,"I. When Did The Crisis Begin? (Article by Toby Rogers republished from Expose-News.com ) Lots of writers in the resistance try to figure out when the crisis began – the crisis being that global monopoly capitalism is trying to enslave the entire developed world via chronic illness. Obviously, the problem began well before SARS-CoV-2 was released in 2019. Many people in the Resistance point to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act as the start of the crisis. But the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) has been running the country at least since the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 . Perhaps the crisis began when the US imported Nazi and Japanese bioweapons scientists after World War II ? Others pinpoint the start of the crisis to the creation of the Federal Reserve and the imposition of the federal income tax in 1913 that enabled the US to become a modern global empire. I’ve argued before that covid is just the continuation of global conquest, colonisation, and empire that began in 1492 . Perhaps the problem began when we stopped being hunter-gatherers and first became farmers (to make beer, according to one leading theory ). When one works through a wide range of different possible points of origins one can make a strong case that the problem goes back to original sin. It’s the flaw that is unique to humans amongst all of the other animals – we are conscious of the difference between good and evil and yet we often choose evil. I actually think this is the correct answer – the problem goes all the way back to the problem of sin itself. And so, it occurred to me recently that the covid crisis represents an extreme example of the Seven Deadly Sins. II. The Covid Disaster as an Extreme Example of the Seven Deadly Sins The Seven Deadly Sins have a fascinating history . Tertullian first started writing about them in Carthage around 200 A.D. The Christian monk Evagrius Ponticus expanded upon the idea beginning around 383 A.D. in Egypt. But the list of the Seven Deadly Sins that most of us are familiar with comes from Pope Gregory I in 590 A.D. Read more at: Expose-News.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-rising-cancer-rates-iowa-linked-agricultural-chemicals.html,"Rising cancer rates in Iowa linked to agricultural chemicals like glyphosate, atrazine and chlorpyrifos","Iowa is grappling with a stark and troubling reality: the state has recently been identified as having the fastest-growing cancer rates in the nation . This alarming increase in cancer rates has prompted a closer examination of environmental factors contributing to this troubling trend. A 2024 report by the Iowa Department of Public Health reveals that cancer rates in rural areas of the state, where pesticide use is more intensive, are significantly higher compared to urban regions. The study highlights that communities with heavy agricultural activity have seen a rise in cases of leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer. Iowa’s cancerous frontier dominated by glyphosate, atrazine, nitrates, chlorpyrifos Iowa has seen a dramatic rise in cancer diagnoses , with 486 new cases per 100,000 people in 2024, surpassing the national average of 444 cases per 100,000. The estimated number of new cancer cases this year stands at 21,000, with approximately 6,100 deaths expected. This surge in cancer rates is particularly concerning given that Iowa's cancer incidence now outpaces other states facing their own unique health challenges, such as industrial pollution, smoking and high obesity rates. The state, known for its expansive agricultural landscape, relies heavily on pesticides to protect crops and maximize yields. The state’s agriculture sector uses a variety of chemical treatments, including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. The most commonly used pesticides in Iowa include glyphosate, atrazine and chlorpyrifos. Glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide, is used extensively in the cultivation of corn and soybeans. Glyphosate disrupts the shikimate pathway of gut microbes and has been linked to an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. Atrazine, another herbicide, is frequently applied to control weeds in cornfields. Atrazine has been associated with endocrine disruption, which may increase the risk of certain cancers. Studies have found atrazine is responsible for alterations in the HPG axis, damaging reproductive function. It also has estrogenic effects , leading to aromatase activation, including inhibition of PDE4 and altered hormone secretion — precursors to breast cancer. Chlorpyrifos, an insecticide, is employed to combat pests in a variety of crops. Chlorpyrifos, although banned for residential use, is still permitted in agriculture and has been linked to developmental and cancer risks . Nitrates, which are key ingredient in fertilizers used across Iowa, are linked to colorectal cancer . In addition to herbicides, insecticides and fertilizer, radon — a naturally occurring radioactive gas — also poses a significant risk. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and is particularly problematic in Iowa, where levels are six times higher than the national average. Radon can seep into homes undetected, further exacerbating health risks for residents. Public becoming more aware of the most pervasive cause of cancer — agricultural chemicals Local advocacy groups have been vocal about the need for regulatory changes and increased transparency regarding pesticide use. “We’re seeing a troubling correlation between pesticide exposure and rising cancer rates,” said Emily Carter, director of the Iowa Environmental Justice Coalition. “It’s crucial that we address this issue head-on by implementing stricter regulations and supporting research into safer alternatives.” Environmental organizations have called for a re-evaluation of pesticide approval processes and greater investment in research on organic farming methods. They advocate for increased monitoring of pesticide residues in soil and water, and better protection for agricultural workers and their families. Sharon, an Iowan diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, and Dave, who has battled non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have turned their attention to advocating for better water safety and stricter regulations on pesticides. Both individuals, from Davenport, barely drink alcohol, do not smoke and are physically active. They have invested in extensive water testing and filtration to mitigate potential contamination from agricultural chemicals. “We want our water tested, reported, and treated for pesticides and nitrates,” Sharon Kendall-Dunn stated. “We don’t know exactly where the exposure came from, but we believe it’s crucial to address it.” Their concerns are echoed by Linus Solberg, a Palo Alto County supervisor who has witnessed numerous cancer cases in his rural community. Solberg attributes the high cancer rates to a combination of agricultural chemicals and radon exposure. He has been vocal about the need for more research and governmental action to address these issues. Using laboratory-verified water filtration is one of the most important steps to take in a frontier of toxic, hormone-disrupting agricultural chemicals.

An undercover reporter was able to capture on film an admission by Department of Justice (DOJ) attorney Isaac Belfer that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which he represented in court, lied to the world in claiming that the generic antiparasitic drug ivermectin is ineffective ""horse paste"" against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). As you may recall, ivermectin was a touchy subject all throughout the ""pandemic"" after President Trump made mention of it early on as a remedy for COVID. The FDA started pumping out lies about how the public should avoid taking ivermectin, which landed the agency in court. The three doctors who sued the FDA – Drs. Mary Talley Bowden, Robert L. Apter, and Paul E. Marik – ended up winning their multi-year case after the agency issued guidance, in violation of the law, against using ivermectin as a remedy for COVID. ""You are not a horse,"" the FDA tweeted in 2021. ""You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it."" According to Belfer, the FDA deserved to lose the case in which he represented the agency because it overstepped its statutory authority in tweeting the above medical advice, making those who were taking ivermectin sound silly. ""So, what the agency has done ... [is] unquestionably beyond its authority,"" Belfer told the undercover Project Veritas reporter. ""Making a recommendation of what drugs to take or not to take, that's the practice of medicine.

Operation Warp Speed eclipsed ivermectin Another thing the FDA did wrong with its handling of ivermectin during COVID was fail to inform the public that the award-winning antiparasitic medicine has been safely and effectively used -- on humans -- for decades, having been approved for use by the FDA itself back in the mid-1990s. Nobody had a problem with ivermectin until COVID arrived. Then, suddenly, it was perceived as ""crazy"" and well outside the bounds of normal medicine for anyone to try it, at least according to government authorities. Even though most avoided it like the plague, some medical doctors were brave enough to prescribe ivermectin to their COVID patients in defiance of the FDA's warnings. Some of the doctors who did this ended up being punished by the medical police state. The FDA played a key role in driving anti-ivermectin sentiment all throughout the ""pandemic."" By keeping ivermectin out of the limelight, the agency and others were able to push the fast-tracked, big money-making COVID ""vaccines"" that were unleashed through Operation Warp Speed. ""This speedy vaccine roll-out could only be accomplished through the FDA's emergency use authorization (EUA), and only if no other alternative medications existed to treat COVID-19,"" Project Veritas explains. ""The FDA's tweets caused a deadly chain reaction. The agency's pronouncements were swiftly enforced by national medical associations and regulatory agencies, pharmacists refused to fill prescriptions, insurance refused to pay for it, and doctors who prescribed it faced career ruin."" According to Dr. Apter, there were likely millions of unnecessary deaths that occurred because of the FDA's crusade against ivermectin. ""If more people had access to early treatment in the form of ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, hydroxychloroquine ... we could have nipped the pandemic in the bud,"" added Dr. Bowden.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-sermon-021-bitter-wormwood-powerful-anti-parasitic.html,"Sermon 21: Bitter WORMWOOD is a powerful ANTI-PARASITIC natural medicine, reveals Bible nutrition educator Mike Adams","According to the Health Ranger Mike Adams, the bitter-tasting wormwood herb ( Artemisia absinthium ) is a natural medicine that works very well against parasites. He shared this fact during the 21st sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. The herb's name is prominently mentioned in the Book of Revelation , where the third angel blows the third of seven trumpets. ""The name of the star is wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter,"" states the passage (Revelations 8:10-11) from the biblical book. Adams interestingly mentioned that wormwood in this context does not pertain to the literal herb, but as something that tastes very bitter. ""The wormwood herb … is very bitter tasting. Now, it is these bitters though that give wormwood some amazing properties. One of those is it's a very effective cure for malaria, and wormwood tends to grow in areas where mosquitoes can get out of control and spread malaria,"" Adams said. ""It is a natural medicine, and it should really only be used therapeutically or medicinally when needed – but not consumed every single day. As with a lot of these natural molecules, there can be toxicity if over-consumed as a food."" According to the Natural News and Brighteon.com founder, God puts taste in plants to give people a clue about its use. Something intended to be eaten daily or frequently will taste neutral or good like fruits, nuts, seeds or grains. In contrast, bitter-tasting herbs like wormwood mean they are not for everyday consumption. He further explained that this bitter taste in wormwood comes from alkaloids in the plant, such as artemisinin. A 2018 study in Nature Communications cited by Adams found that artemisinin and its derivative compounds kill the parasites responsible for malaria in two ways – damaging proteins and inhibiting the function of proteases (protein complexes) inside the parasites. Sweet wormwood also exhibits healing properties According to the Health Ranger, malaria happens when mosquitoes inject the disease-causing parasites in the bloodstream when the insects bite people. Artemisinin is a very powerful remedy given its anti-parasitic properties, leading Adams to recommend its use to ensure blood purity. (Related: WHO: Artemisinin is a powerful remedy against malaria .) Aside from being potent against parasites, artemisinin is even used to help treat cancer. It is also used to repel snakes. But A. absinthium is not the only wormwood that possesses healing properties. Adams mentioned during the same sermon that sweet wormwood ( A. annua ) is another example of God putting His miraculous medicine on Earth to heal people. A. annua , called qinghao in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used in the practice for 2,000 years to treat fevers and a variety of inflammatory conditions. A TCM practitioner lights the end of a cigar-shaped wormwood herb bundle or moxa stick. The wormwood's burning ember emits certain types of warming radiation into the human body. When artemisinin is burned – just like in moxibustion – it emits certain wavelengths of infrared light that penetrates the human tissues up to six inches deep. The infrared light brings back to life the senescent cells or cells that have gone into a near-death zombie state. Adams continued that this can work wonders in people who lack proper circulation in the body or suffer from a lack of ability to heal.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-massachusetts-town-voluntary-lockdown-one-case-eee.html,Massachusetts town pushes VOLUNTARY LOCKDOWN after just a single case of mosquito-borne disease,"The spread of a deadly mosquito-borne virus has forced state and local health officials to advise people in a Massachusetts town not to leave their homes after dark . The Board of Health in Oxford, a city of 13,300 people about 50 miles southwest of Boston, has set an outdoor curfew in hopes it will reduce the chances of people being bitten by mosquitoes which bring eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). This decision was made after a resident of the town became the first human to contract the rare and untreatable disease domestically in almost four years. EEE triggers a fever and brain swelling and can result in seizures and comas. One-third of people infected with EEE die and those who recover are frequently left with lifelong physical and mental problems. The dusk-to-dawn curfew begins at around 8 p.m. It is only a recommendation and not a rule but town officials are hoping it will drive people inside before peak mosquito hours, decreasing risk of exposure. (Related: Florida issues MALARIA alert as mosquitos emerge in Sunshine State .) Officials have not released the identity of the man infected but have said he is in his 80s, lives in Oxford and contracted the illness recently . The EEE risk level has been raised to critical in four cities and elevated to moderate in nine others. A memo released by the Town of Oxford said the individual is hospitalized and ""courageously battling this virus,"" according to one of his family members who has reached out to officials many times. ""They want people to be aware this is an extremely serious disease with terrible physical and emotional consequences, regardless if the person manages to live,"" said Oxford Town Manager Jennifer Callahan in a memo regarding the family of the man who caught the virus that had reached out to her office. ""They want residents to take the public health recommendations regarding prevention measures of contracting this virus seriously."" The memo also said that a horse infected with EEE in nearby Connecticut had died from the virus. There were 12 human cases of EEE in Massachusetts in 2019 and six people died, while there were five human cases and one death in 2020. As reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health there were no cases or deaths in each year from 2021 to 2023. So far in 2024, two other cases of EEE have been reported , one each in Vermont and New Jersey. All three current American patients have developed serious neuroinvasive cases. EEE a very serious condition with a mortality rate of about 33% According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), EEE symptoms usually start within four to 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Most people infected do not show symptoms but those who develop severe cases will experience fever, chills, body aches and joint pain. The CDC added that for mild cases, recovery takes about one to two weeks and a patient could possibly recover completely if the infection does not affect the central nervous system. Those with severe cases can develop meningitis or encephalitis. The symptoms consist of fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavioral changes, drowsiness and even coma. The CDC said that although EEE is rare, it is very serious and about 33 percent of people who become infected die. Death usually happens about two to 10 days after the emergence of symptoms. Massachusetts authorities said people who survive are generally permanently disabled and only a few totally recover. The disease is common in birds, and even though humans and some other mammals can get EEE, they don't spread the disease. The CDC said only a few cases of EEE are reported in the United States annually, with most infections identified in the eastern and Gulf Coast states. There are no vaccines and specific treatments for EEE. Follow Plague.info for more news about mosquito-borne diseases spreading in America.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-29-cauliflower-versatile-nutrition-superstar-surprising-health-benefits.html,Cauliflower: A nutritious vegetable with incredible health benefits,"Cauliflower, also known as ""flowering cabbage"" and a member of the cruciferous vegetable family from the genus Brassica oleracea , has been gaining popularity recently thanks to its flexibility in recipes and impressive health benefits backed by science. Listed below are some of the reasons why you should consider adding this fantastic vegetable to your family's meals. Packed with essential nutrients Cauliflower is rich in almost every nutrient your body needs to stay healthy. It offers a wide range of vitamins, including A, C, D, E, K and a whole host of B vitamins. Beyond vitamins, cauliflower is also loaded with essential minerals , such as calcium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium sodium, sulfur and zinc – all of which play crucial roles in maintaining optimal health. Just 100 grams of cauliflower can give you 25 percent of your daily vitamin K needs and all the vitamin C you require for the day. Additionally, cauliflower is naturally free of cholesterol and fats and it is low in calories – making it a healthy swap for higher-carb foods, like potatoes and rice. (Related: Cauliflower’s range of nutritional benefits are numerous and long-lasting .) A great source of choline Cauliflower is also a great source of choline, a nutrient that many people lack because it is not abundant in most foods. A single cup of cauliflower contains about 45 milligrams of choline, which is approximately 11 percent of the daily recommended intake for women and eight percent for men. Choline is vital for several bodily functions , including maintaining cell structures, supporting the nervous system and aiding in DNA synthesis and fat metabolism. Boosts your immune system Cauliflower, like vegetables in the cruciferous family, is rich in sulfur, which plays a key role in promoting a healthy gut and enhancing the immune system. Sulfur helps produce glutathione, an important and powerful antioxidant that protects your cells from inflammation and supports the repair and regeneration of the gut lining. A healthy gut is essential for a strong immune system, making cauliflower a great choice for supporting optimal overall health. Helps prevent cancer Cauliflower is packed with sulforaphane, an extremely powerful antioxidant known for its potential to combat various types of cancer, such as bladder, breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanomas, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. This compound works by inhibiting certain enzymes that contribute to the growth of cancer cells and tumors. The vegetable also contains isothiocyanates, which have properties that may reduce cancer risk by blocking estrogen activity and providing chemopreventive benefits, like preventing the growth of cancer cells. Promotes heart health The sulforaphane in cauliflower can help lower blood pressure and improve the condition of your arteries–both of which are key factors in preventing heart disease. Researchers believe that sulforaphane benefits heart health by enhancing DNA methylation, which is vital for normal cellular functions and gene regulation–especially in the delicate lining of the arteries (endothelium). Healthier arteries contribute to better heart function and a stronger heart. Cauliflower's vitamin K content plays a role in proper blood clotting – reducing the risk of excessive bleeding from injuries. Moreover, cauliflower contains glucoraphanin, which is converted into isothiocyanates in the body. These compounds help reduce inflammation and prevent the buildup of lipids (fats) in the blood vessels – promoting smooth blood flow and reducing the risk of conditions, like atherosclerosis, which contributes to overall cardiovascular health Supports digestive health Cauliflower is a great source of fiber, with about two grams of fiber per 100 grams. It contains both soluble and insoluble fiber, which are key to maintaining a healthy digestive system. Insoluble fiber doesn't dissolve in water; instead, it helps move food and waste smoothly through your digestive tract by adding bulk to your stool – promoting regular bowel movements. Meanwhile, soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance which slows down digestion and keeps you feeling full longer. Cauliflower also contains compounds like glucoraphanin, glucosinolate and sulforaphane that protect the lining of your stomach. These compounds help prevent the growth of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which can harm your stomach and intestinal tissues – leading to inflammation, pain and, in some cases, peptic ulcers in the upper digestive tract. Choosing and storing cauliflower When buying cauliflower , choose heads with firm and tight curds (florets) and bright green leaves that are firmly attached. Avoid any heads that have brown spots or those that look loose and spread out. You can buy whole heads of cauliflower and cut them into florets yourself at home or opt to buy pre-cut florets for convenience, Be aware that cauliflower wrapped in plastic can retain moisture, which can lead to faster spoilage. To keep cauliflower fresh longer, remove the wrapping and store them in loosely sealed bags with a paper towel to absorb moisture. Whole heads of cauliflower can last in the refrigerator for about four to seven days. To add some variety to your meals, consider trying different colors of cauliflower , such as green, orange or purple, which can brighten up your salads, side dishes and snacks.

Shein, which sells clothing and other accessories for women, was discovered to be shipping out products containing toxins at sometimes hundreds of times above acceptable levels. The same goes for Temu and AliExpress, both of which sell garbage laced with highly destructive chemical substances. Taking full advantage of the broken American economy and all of the inflation that is pricing normal Americans out of their own country, Shein, Temu and AliExpress are notorious for undercutting the costs of consumer products by a substantial amount. Those discounts come at a major price for consumer health, though. To manufacture and ship out cheap junk at warp speed, Shein, Temu and AliExpress are reportedly cutting corners and using the cheapest quality materials, oftentimes in violation of safety standards in the First World, including in Korea where officials are sounding the alarm to beware of all this cheap Chinese junk. (Related: Speaking of toxic chemicals hiding in plain sight, did you know that yet another U.S. government report found that fluoridated water destroys children's brains?) Chinese toxins being shipped around the world A recent inspection of 144 products from Shein, AliExpress and Temu found that numerous products from all three companies fail to meet even the most basic legal standards of the countries where they are primarily being shipped. A batch of shoes from Shein, for instance, were found to contain exceptionally high levels of phthalates, which are chemicals added to plastics to make them more flexible. One pair of shoes tested contained phthalates at 229 times the legal limit. ""Phthalate-based plasticizers affect reproductive functions such as sperm count reduction, and can cause infertility and even premature birth,"" noted an official from Seoul's environmental health team in a statement to Agence France-Presse . One of the phthalate chemicals identified ""is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Cancer Institute, so special care should be taken to avoid long-term contact with the human body,"" an official statement from that environmental body reads. Caps sold by Shein were found to contain formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical often used in home building products, at levels twice the allowable limit. Numerous bottles of nail polish from Shein also contained dioxane, a possible human carcinogen known to cause liver poisoning. The bottles contained dioxane at levels more than 3.6 times the legal limit, as well as methanol at concentrations 1.4 times the legal limit. In a statement to AFP responding to the findings, Shein claimed that it ""work[s] closely with international third-party testing agencies ... to regularly carry out risk-based sampling tests to ensure that products provided by suppliers meet Shein's product safety standards."" ""Our suppliers are required to comply with the controls and standards we have put in place as well as the product safety laws and regulations in the countries we operate in."" A pair of samples from Temu that was tested turned up levels of led in the insoles at levels 11 times the permissible limit. Temu claims it ""immediately launched an internal investigation"" after learning about the test results. ""We have swiftly removed these product listings from our global marketplace and are enhancing our systems and guidance to merchants to ensure they comply with safety standards and local regulations."" Officials in Seoul have asked the offending companies to immediately remove all products that contain toxic substances. EU regulators are also taking action to push these Chinese companies to stop exposing their customers to deadly chemicals via low-quality consumer products.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-trump-plans-criminalize-gender-transition-surgery-elected.html,Trump plans to criminalize GENDER TRANSITION surgery on minors without parental consent if elected,"Former President Donald Trump plans to announce his proposal of criminalizing ""gender transition"" surgeries on minors without parental consent, but has not given a definite date as to when. According to LifeSiteNews , the Trump campaign issued prepared remarks on Aug. 20 for the real estate mogul to read during his stop at the Livingston County Sheriff's Department in Howell, Michigan. While the remarks included this promise, Trump delivered the speech without mentioning it. ""To protect our children from sexual mutilation, we will make it a felony for any medical professional to perform surgery on a minor without parental consent,"" the prepared statement read. It also promised capital punishment for ""child rapists and child traffickers."" But a report by the Independent the following day, Aug. 21, said promises are still coming. Campaign sources told the outlet that the said promises are being reserved for a ""special occasion."" According to the tipsters, the said announcements are ""too important to get lost in the shuffle"" of the Democratic National Convention held from Aug. 19 to 22. LifeSiteNews noted that Trump has a mixed stance on LGBT issues. While he has thrown his support behind homosexual ""marriage,"" his stance on religious liberty and the gender fluidity movement was closer to those of social conservatives. For his present campaign, Trump already promised to ""protect children from left-wing gender insanity."" He has also pledged to ban federal funding, approval and promotion of ""gender transition"" practices. Trump's pledge serves as welcome news for parents According to LifeSiteNews , Trump's pledge is a welcome news to American parents. But the pro-life outlet acknowledged that some would prefer a complete ban on such procedures whether or not parents can consent to them. The news of Trump's potential announcement came amid the news of the Swiss government taking away a daughter from her father. According to the Daily Signal , the daughter was abducted after her father refused to allow her to start medical transition procedures. (Related: Swiss government ""kidnaps"" children and threatens parents with jail time for opposing transgender mutilations .) Meanwhile, in liberal states like California, legislators have taken aggressive steps to assist child gender-transition efforts despite parental consent. In some instances, lawmakers have driven policies that remove children from families that don't adopt gender ideology. The California State Assembly passed a bill last September that would need judges in child custody cases to examine whether a parent has approved a child’s ""gender transition"" by making ""gender affirmation"" an equal part of a child's ""health, safety and welfare"" under state law. Under the bill, parents who refuse to go along could be guilty of failing to give for the ""health, safety and welfare"" of their child – therefore losing custody to another parent or the state. A major body of evidence has shown that "" affirming"" gender confusion brings severe injuries , especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity and life experience to consider the long-term consequences of the decisions being driven on them or complete knowledge about the long-term impacts of life-changing, physically transformative and usually irreversible surgical and chemical procedures. Studies discovered that more than 80 percent of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that ""transition"" procedures, in addition to full ""reassignment"" surgery, fail to deal with gender-confused individuals' profound tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even worsen it by increasing their confusion and disregarding the real root causes of their mental conflict.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-7-herbs-wound-care-prepper-should-know.html,7 Herbs for wound care every prepper should know about,"Since time immemorial, humans have been using plants for medicine, especially for treating and disinfecting wounds. For instance, in India – the birthplace of the oldest medical system known to man (Ayurveda) – tribes in the north eastern provinces relied on more than 800 different plant species to treat their wounds before the advent of modern medicine. A recent study identified Indian pennywort, emperor's candlesticks, papaya, garlic, turmeric, aloe vera and cotton tree as some of the plants traditionally used by Indian healers for wound healing. In the Balkan Peninsula (southeastern Europe), meanwhile, folk healers were said to have made infusions, decoctions, ointments, skin oils and balms to treat wounds and various skin issues using plants like broadleaf plantain, St. John's wort, yarrow , marigold, elderberry, coltsfoot and plums. These plants have been reported by studies to have potent wound healing effects, confirming the reliability of herbs as natural remedies. When SHTF, you can take advantage of the healing properties of various medicinal plants by growing them in your backyard or home garden or by learning how to forage for them. (Related: Going green? Here's what you need to know about medicinal herb gardens .) 7 Wound-healing herbs you can use for first aid The likelihood of receiving professional medical care if you get injured goes down in times of disaster or emergency. Natural disasters can easily overwhelm or put a stop to emergency services. This is why it's important to be prepared for these situations. Having a first-aid kit ready along with a well-stocked medicine cabinet is the best way to ensure that even the smallest injuries can get treated so they don't turn into something serious. Herbs and natural products are generally safer to use and gentler on the body than modern medications. Aside from being effective, researchers agree that herbal medicines cause fewer side effects, especially when taken at the recommended doses. When SHTF and you find yourself needing to treat minor wounds, scratches, insect bites and the like, remember these seven herbs with wound-healing properties that you can use as emergency medicine: (h/t to TheOrganicPrepper.com ) Wolf's bane (arnica) Arnica montana , also known as wolf's bane, is a perennial plant with yellow-orange flowers native to the mountains of Europe and Siberia but is now widely cultivated in North America. Studies show that wolf's bane is brimming with bioactive components that give it antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. Traditionally used as a topical medicine since the 1500s, wolf's bane extract is now a common ingredient in skin creams, ointments, liniments, salves and tinctures. A study published in the journal Frontiers in Surgery also reported that wolf's bane is "" equal in effectiveness to conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"" and recommended its use for treating postoperative pain and swelling. Calendula Calendula officinalis , commonly known as pot marigold, is a flowering plant from the daisy family. Easy to grow and with edible flowers and leaves , this herb has a long history of use in traditional medicine as a wound healing agent. Calendula is said to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that make it perfect for dressing wounds. In fact, calendula flowers can be made into a paste or decoction and applied topically to treat abrasions and skin infections . According to a review published in the journal Wounds , calendula contains bioactive polysaccharides and other compounds that help prevent infection, stimulate immune response at the site of injury and promote faster wound healing. (Related: Home remedies for preppers: 5 Medicinal plants for wound healing .) Comfrey Symphytum officinale , or comfrey, has been the go-to natural remedy for muscle pains and joint complaints for centuries. A flowering plant from the forget-me-not family, comfrey is known for its powerful anti-inflammatory, de-swelling and pain-relieving properties that make it excellent for treating blunt injuries. These same properties also make comfrey a great natural alternative to NSAIDs. In addition, studies have found that the roots and leaves of comfrey can help accelerate wound healing when applied topically, thanks to a compound called allantoin that helps new skin cells grow. Echinacea Several plants that belong to the genus Echinacea are known to reduce inflammation and boast a long history of use as wound-healing agents. Among them, E. pallida (pale purple coneflower) and E. purpurea (purple coneflower) are said to have the best anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, thanks to a compound called echinacoside . Echinacoside has been shown to promote cicatrization (reduction of wound size) and exert antibacterial and protective effects on skin connective tissue. Although more popular today for its antiviral activities, E. angustifolia , also known as narrow-leaved purple coneflower, also exerts beneficial effects when applied on wounds. Plantain Plantago major , known by its common name the broadleaf plantain, has been used since ancient times to treat a wide range of issues, including constipation, coughs and wounds . Plantain leaves, in particular, were used by the Vikings for wound healing and by the ancient Greeks to treat dog bites. Topical use of plantain leaves usually involved mixing them with honey, while oral use saw them being boiled with butter before being eaten. According to a study published in the journal Food Bioscience , plantain owes its wound-healing properties to ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, two active compounds that have been shown to increase the rate of wound closure and improve wound healing time . (Related: Home remedies 101: How to create your own plantain salve .) St. John's wort Hypericum perforatum , also called St. John's wort, is a widely known medicinal plant with yellow flowers. Although it is considered a noxious weed in seven U.S. states , studies show that St. John's wort has plenty of health-supporting properties, including antidepressive and wound healing activities . Preparations containing St. John's wort (e.g., oils and tinctures) are often used to treat minor wounds, sunburn, abrasions, bruises, contusions and many other skin issues. According to a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , the wound-healing effects of St. John's wort appear to be ""mainly due to the increase in the stimulation of fibroblast collagen production and the activation of fibroblast cells,"" which help in wound repair by closing the damaged area. Yarrow Achillea millefolium , also known as yarrow, is a tall plant from the daisy family that produces dome-shaped clusters of small white flowers. Native to North America, this herb is known for its astringent qualities and was used by Native Americans and early settlers to treat wounds and stop bleeding. Yarrow is said to be good for scrapes and bruises as well as for fevers, colds and the flu. Yarrow essential oil also contains compounds that help reduce inflammation and swelling and fight bacterial infections. In a study published in the Journal of Pharmacopuncture , researchers found that yarrow essential oil can stimulate collagen production when applied to open wounds, thus helping speed up wound closure. (Related: Your SHTF medicinal herb kit should contain yarrow .) Medicinal plants are versatile, effective and inexpensive remedies that you can count on in times of emergencies.

And one of the reasons is the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccine"" mandates that killed or drove away many servicemen during the ""pandemic."" The plan is to sideline 17 support and replenishment ships for the Navy by putting them into ""extended maintenance"" mode while reassigning their crews to other ships. This will free up between 600 and 700 sailors for use in combat to fight the wars of the military-industrial complex. A persistent lack of qualified mariners to operate the vessels has put the Navy into something of a bind as the U.S. sends troops to the Middle East to provide backup to Israel as surrounding Arab countries seem to be readying for war. Military Sealift Command's ""force generation reset"" identified two Lewis and Clark replenishment ships, one fleet oiler, a dozen Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPF), and two forward-deployed Navy expeditionary sea bases that will enter ""extended maintenance"" to free up more sailors. >Navy currently undertaking the longest carrier group deployments since Vietnam >Decides to delete support and replenishment fleet Serious country going serious places. pic.twitter.com/IeHTFFFjSZ — HankHeIl (@HankHeil) August 23, 2024 (Related: Getting jabbed for COVID decreases one's lifespan, research says .) U.S. Navy calling plan ""the great reset"" The plan, which has yet to be formally adopted by the Navy, is still awaiting approval from the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti. Ominously, they are calling the plan ""the great reset."" Franchetti received her Bachelor's degree in journalism at Northwestern University and a Master's Degree in Organizational Management from The University of Phoenix . Retired MSC commander Rear Adm. Michael Wettlaufer is the one responsible for imposing the severe ""gangway up"" COVID prevention measures that USNI News says greatly contributed to the Navy's retention problems. ""[During] COVID, nobody was getting off the ship, mariners were being treated poorly, and so they started to quit,"" a retired MSC mariner told the media outlet. Since then, ""mariners have been quitting at a greater rate than MSC can hire new ones ... People say 'I had to quit because it's a terrible work-life balance. I can't go to sea and also have a family, so I've got to leave.'"" Another former MSC mariner said that while he enjoyed sailing with MSC, he realized it was a bad bet to continue after witnessing his older peers dealing with divorce and estrangement from their children. ""I can't say much bad about MSC, but when I left, I left because of my family,"" he said. Sal Mercogliano, a former MSC mariner and associate professor of history at Campbell University , commented that the Navy's ongoing problems with retention are ""basically the result of many years of neglect and mismanagement of their force."" ""They are just burning through people,"" he said. Simply put, MSC has been mismanaged for so long that once the extreme COVID measures were introduced, the straw finally broke the camel's back. For every billet on an MSC ship, there are about 1.27 mariners there to fill the positions, which is simply not sustainable. ""If you're required to have 100 people on a vessel,"" a former MSC mariner said. ""There are only 27 more people on shore at any given time to rotate those crew members."" Such a ratio allows a mariner to only be home for one month at a time while having to remain at sea for four months in a row. ""That math just doesn't work,"" he added. ""No one is able to have a healthy work-life balance and be able to get off the ship and get adequate time to go home, have time at home with their family, take leave, take care of medical requirements [in that timeframe]. There is so much training required of every billet at MSC to stay proficient with Navy requirements and training and merchant marine credentialing."" COVID jabs are poison.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-new-england-lockdowns-extremely-rare-virus-one-infected.html,Four New England towns impose tyrannical LOCKDOWNS after “extremely rare virus” infects ONE PERSON,"Four towns in Massachusetts – Douglas, Oxford, Sutton and Webster – are imposing indefinite ""voluntary"" lockdowns after one – yes, one – person tested positive for an ""extremely rare virus"" they are calling eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Every night from now on, residents and visitors to these four towns will be frowned upon if they are spotted outside their homes after dark, this to stop the spread of the potentially deadly mosquito-borne illness. This most recent case of EE is the first since 2020 to be confirmed in Worcester County by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). The Oxford Board of Health voted to support the recommendation that people remain indoors after 6:00 pm every night from now through at least September 30 since the EEE virus apparently only spreads after the sun sets. Beginning on October 1, Oxford's lockdown time will start an hour earlier at 5:00 pm every night and remain that way until the first hard frost hits the region. The lockdowns are ""voluntary"" in the sense that there will be ""no enforcement,"" officials say, if residents refuse to comply. There is a catch, though, as anyone who wants ""to use town fields outside these recommendations ... will have to show proof of insurance and sign an indemnification form."" Those without insurance are apparently out of luck and will have to go home and ""stay safe"" every night at sundown, allowing only those wealthy enough to have insurance to use outdoor public facilities – talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. (Related: Will Joe Biden succeed in locking down America a second time before leaving office early next year?) CDC says there are only a ""few cases"" of EEE nationwide every year One would think from these government actions in Massachusetts that EEE is a fast-spreading plague that threatens entire towns with extinction unless people go home when it gets dark. The truth, though, is that EEE is a complete non-threat. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are only a ""few cases"" of EEE that occur in the United States annually. In other words, EEE, for all intents and purposes, does not even exist for 99.999 percent of the population. The only reason the idea of imposing citywide lockdowns for something as non-threatening as EEE is even considered is because of the precedent that was set by the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic."" Now, whenever the government or media report about a ""threat,"" they can get away with much more tyranny than pre-COVID because the public has been conditioned to accept overreactive paranoia and tyranny as the ""solutions"" to ""viruses."" In the comments, someone asked whether or not the people of Massachusetts were brainwashed enough during COVID to fall for this and comply, or if enough people have awoken to the reality that the world was played by the COVID scam. ""Will they fall for it or will they roundly ignore these new 'recommendations' from the Public Hell department?"" this person wrote. Another wrote that this is ""dubious timing"" for governments to once again start pushing ""knee-jerk"" public health measures, and could have something to do with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsing Donald Trump for president. ""The most prominent member of the Kennedy clan endorsing Trump is likely to flip the entire eastern seaboard red, so it's probably an opportune time for whacked out Democrats to cook up another a disinformation campaign and do their best to instill fear in the North Atlantic states,"" this person said. ""Seems they've got a new toy, 'lockdowns,' and they can't bear to put it down,"" wrote another about the public health tyrants who became addicted to power during COVID.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-israel-pauses-war-gaza-inoculate-children-provocation-poliomyelitis.html,VACCINE WEAPONS: Israel pauses war in Gaza to inoculate children with “provocation poliomyelitis” – further crippling and depopulating the region,"As the Israeli military righteously hunts down Hamas terrorists in the Gaza strip, they have completely disregarded the growing toll of civilian casualties – especially Palestinian children – who are either blown to pieces, buried in rubble or end up starved and sickened, lacking access to food and medical care . The Israeli military has either restricted, destroyed or militarily cut off aid to the Gaza strip. The territory's healthcare system has been devastated, with only about a third of its hospitals and 40 percent of primary healthcare facilities currently operational. Now, Israel is maniacally agreeing to pause the war in Gaza so that their forces can deliver tens of thousands of live polio vaccines to the children of Gaza. These inoculations inevitably spread vaccine-derived polio strains that will lead to ""provocation poliomyelitis"" – further crippling and depopulating the region. UN, WHO and UNICEF join Israeli military to inoculate 640,000 children across Gaza The United Nations has called for a comprehensive inoculation campaign following the confirmation of the first polio case in Gaza since the mid-1990s. In response to the crisis, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has indicated that Washington is working with Israeli officials to finalize a coordinated vaccination plan, with implementation expected in the coming weeks. Joining forces with Israel’s depopulation agenda, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have emphasized the urgency for inoculating the children of Gaza , calling for a minimum seven-day ceasefire to facilitate the vaccination of approximately 640,000 children across the Strip. With the support of 2,700 workers, the vaccination campaign aims to reach every municipality in the region. The vaccine shipment is sufficient to inoculate approximately 1,255,000 individuals, which represents just over half of Gaza’s population. This initiative is part of a broader effort coordinated by Israel’s civilian coordination agency, COGAT, and international health organizations. COGAT has announced that international and local medical teams will oversee the distribution of the vaccines over the coming days. The plan includes conducting vaccinations at various locations within Gaza during routine humanitarian pauses. These pauses are intended to allow civilians to access remaining dilapidated medical centers where they can receive the vaccine. Junk polio vaccines become weapons of depopulation in Gaza These junk polio vaccines, which are now proven to spread vaccine-derived polio strains , will continue to spread polio in Gaza and will do nothing to improve living conditions, water quality or sanitation, nor restore health, vitality and immunity to the children who are now suffering from malnutrition and severely unsanitary conditions. The conditions for outbreaks and serious disease are much higher in childhood populations that do not have access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition and proper medical care . By intentionally spreading vaccine-derived polio strains in Gaza, the United Nations, the Israeli forces and UNICEF are basically taking a torch to a drought-stricken forest, begging for wildfires to take hold (exacerbating disease outbreaks in children). Polio vaccines cause muscular and neurological injuries that allow poliovirus to paralyze children Whether global health authorities have good intentions or not, the polio vaccine will cause further damage to the children of Gaza. Studies show that skeletal muscle injury can make individuals more susceptible to neurological complications from poliovirus infections, a phenomenon known as “provocation poliomyelitis.” This condition often results from unnecessary injections in children living in areas where poliovirus is common, leading to cases of childhood paralysis. A study from 1998 suggests that intramuscular injections may also heighten the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis among those receiving live attenuated poliovirus vaccines. The study found the precise pathogenic mechanism connecting intramuscular injections with provocation poliomyelitis. This skeletal muscle injury triggers retrograde axonal transport of the poliovirus, which aids in the virus's invasion of the central nervous system and exacerbates spinal cord damage. The Israeli military created the conditions for disease to spread in the first place, creating filthy and unsanitary conditions that cause the spread of diseases, while burdening families with survival-mode levels of stress and fatigue that precede disease. The lack of basic food and nutrition has rendered the children immunocompromised , allowing for multiple infections to take hold. In a depraved show of fake compassion, the Israeli military is bringing in mass inoculation campaigns that will only make the situation worse, while ignoring the very things these children need in order to survive the hellish conditions that has been fostered on them.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-another-cinnamon-brand-recalled-lead-contamination.html,Another cinnamon brand RECALLED due to LEAD contamination,"Cinnamon is fast becoming one of the most frequently recalled food products in the United States. Earlier this month, El Chilar, LLC expanded its recall of its Canela Molida ground cinnamon after an investigation found traces of lead – making it the 10th cinnamon brand to be recalled for containing the toxic metal this year. Authorities have highlighted that any level of lead exposure is unsafe. In children, high levels of lead can cause behavioral issues, growth relays and learning disabilities, while in adults, it is considered a possible cancer risk. Prolonged exposure to lead can lead to severe health problems, including development issues and, in extreme cases, seizures or death. El Chilar initially recalled two lots of their ground cinnamon in March but has now extended the recall to six lots , adding 127 more boxes sold in Maryland. While no health issues have been reported, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that the affected products may still be in consumer homes and encourages returning them to the store for a refund. While the products have been removed from store shelves in Maryland, some may still be in people's kitchens. If people have any of the recalled cinnamon – codes D-300 EX1024, F272 EX1026, E-054, EX 0225, D-181 and EX 0624 – the FDA recommends returning it for a full refund. (Related: FDA warns consumers to throw away cheap cinnamon products that are heavily contaminated with LEAD .) FDA reminds manufacturers to follow safety regulations concerning lead in spices On Aug. 15, FDA Deputy Administrator for Human Foods Jim Jones released a statement claiming intensified efforts to ensure the safety of cinnamon products in the United States. Last fall, the FDA, in collaboration with health authorities from Maryland, North Carolina and Pennsylvania investigated apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches that were recalled due to dangerous levels of chromium and lead. The contamination was linked to the Ecuador facility of manufacturer Austrofood. On Aug. 9, the FDA issued a warning to Austrofood, citing violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (Preventive Control Human Food Rule). The company failed to properly assess the risk of lead in cinnamon, despite its known prevalence, especially considering the product’s young consumer base (babies and young children). The presence of lead made the product adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The warning is part of the FDA's ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of spices, particularly in foods for children. Earlier this year, the FDA conducted targeted testing of cinnamon sold in discount stores – resulting in further recalls due to high lead levels. State partners have also been actively testing cinnamon products. Food safety, especially for children, is a top priority that requires industry cooperation. In March, the FDA reminded industry players of their duty to follow safety regulations, especially concerning lead in spices. The FDA is also working under the Closer to Zero initiative to reduce children's exposure to heavy metals, like lead, with plans to establish stricter contamination limits and enforce mandatory testing. Additionally, the FDA is tightening oversight on imported foods , including placing the distributor of the contaminated cinnamon, Negasmart, on multiple import alerts.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-south-african-group-challenges-who-mpox-emergency-declaration.html,"South African group challenges WHO’s mpox emergency declaration, warns public about vaccine dangers","The South Africa Vaccine Injury Medico-Legal Study Group (SAVIMS) recently released a press statement expressing its disagreement with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the World Health Organization 's (WHO) declaration about monkey pox (mpox) outbreak being ""a public health emergency of international concern."" Following the announcement of Africa CDC and WHO, SAVIMS expressed serious concerns regarding the proposed emergency rollout of vaccines for mpox in Africa. On Aug. 13, Africa CDC Director-General Hean Kaseya revealed plans to distribute over 10 million doses of mpox vaccines across Africa, starting with three million doses in 2024. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made a similar announcement the following day, emphasizing the urgency of the vaccination effort. However, SAVIMS has questioned the safety and efficacy of this plan, pointing out that there is no vaccine specifically proven to be effective against mpox. The currently recommended vaccines, Jynneos and ACAM2000, are originally developed for smallpox and their use for mpox remains experimental . SAVIMS notes that these vaccines have been linked to serious side effects and contain live virus strains, which could potentially trigger a resurgence of smallpox – a disease that has been eradicated globally. SAVIMS has also raised concerns about the potential use of mRNA vaccines for mpox, stating that there is no scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in preventing or mitigating infectious diseases. According to the group, that the adverse reactions reported with experimental mRNA vaccines significantly outweigh any potential benefits. The group also highlights the importance of informed consent, a legal and ethical requirement in healthcare. Under current conditions, patients cannot provide true informed consent for the mpox vaccines, as the necessary criteria – adequate information, competency and freedom from coercion – are not met. Citing a recent study by Allan-Blitz, et al., which classified mpox as a sexually transmitted disease, SAVIMS suggests that prevention efforts should focus on targeted education and clinical care for high-risk groups, rather than a broad vaccination campaign for the general population. The group also calls for an independent audit of the mpox data collected by the WHO from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations. Understanding mpox and the reasons behind current health crisis Mpox is a viral illness that leads to skin rashes and sores, including those that can develop in the mouth. In its most serious form, mpox can cause life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning, brain swelling and even death. It belongs to a group of diseases known as zoonoses, which are infections that spread from animals to humans. These diseases are a major concern for public health because they have the potential to spark widespread outbreaks. The mpox virus was first discovered in monkeys kept for research in 1958, and the first human case was identified in the DRC in 1970. The virus is similar to the one that causes smallpox and spreads through direct contact with infected animals, people or contaminated surfaces. It can also be transmitted through prolonged close contact, such as being near or speaking to an infected person, as noted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An alleged recent surge in mpox cases has led the WHO and the Africa CDC to declare a public health emergency. Outbreaks have been reported in at least 12 countries, with over 17,000 suspected cases and about 500 deaths. The Africa CDC suggests that these numbers are probably underestimated – meaning the actual figures could be much higher. The last global outbreak in 2022 to 2023 was mostly due to a virus type called ""clade 2."" This time, a more severe type called ""clade 1"" – specifically a strain known as ""clade 1b"" – has been spreading quickly in the DRC. WHO has noted that ""clade 1b"" is primarily spreading in the DRC through sexual contact. In Sweden, a case of ""clade 1"" was reported in a person who had traveled to a region in Africa where the virus is present. (Related: Here comes the fear: The WHO warns that the new mutant strain of monkeypox is an emergency ""for the entire globe ."") This situation is concerning because ""clade 1"" is associated with more serious health problems and a higher death rate compared to ""clade 2.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-statin-drug-industry-profits-from-lies-about-cholesterol.html,Statin drug industry generates OBSCENE PROFITS from institutional lies about cholesterol and the oversimplification of heart disease,"Cholesterol, often vilified as the main driver of heart disease, is actually an essential component to cellular health. It plays a crucial role in various biological functions, including building cell membranes, producing hormones, and aiding in the absorption of vitamins. Cholesterol is a necessary nutrient that our bodies cannot produce on their own, so it’s important to get vitamin D from sunlight, and to consume foods that contain cholesterol to maintain healthy cholesterol levels. But today, doctors are indoctrinated and incentivized to push statin drugs on people at an early age, while ignoring all the dietary and lifestyle factors that influence heart disease risk. The oversimplification of the causes of heart disease leads to widespread pill-pushing that benefits a statin drug industry that's built on a history of lies. Big Pharma capitalizing on heart disease myths The pharmaceutical industry has long profited from the widespread belief that high cholesterol is a primary cause of heart disease. This notion has fueled a booming market for statin drugs, which have become a staple of cardiovascular care, forcefully interfering with cholesterol levels. Major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Merck, have invested heavily in developing and marketing statin medications, reaping substantial financial rewards along the way. According to Data Bridge Market Research, the U.S. statin market size was valued at $4.53 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $5.10 billion by 2031. This growth is driven, in part, by the increasing prevalence of high cholesterol among adults, particularly those aged 40-59. However, the link between high cholesterol and heart disease has been challenged over the past five years, with researchers pointing out manipulated, industry-sponsored studies that overstate the correlation between the two. The predatory financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry have played a significant role in shaping public perception and medical practice. The American College of Cardiology developed a simple calculator that proposes to determine one’s risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next ten years. The calculator uses blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking status and age to make this determination. This calculator is used to pressure patients into taking statins, while ignoring the various dietary and lifestyle factors that predispose a person to heart disease. Vilification of cholesterol ignores the damage caused by sugar and inflammation The vilification of cholesterol began with the work of Ancel Keys. Keys conducted a study of seven countries, which suggested a strong correlation between saturated fat consumption and heart disease. However, these studies have been criticized for methodological flaws and selective data reporting, with critics pointing out that results would be different had he relied on data from seven different countries, such as Finland, Israel, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France and Sweden. At around the same time period, John Yudkin argued that sugar and processed food were driving inflammation of the cardiovascular system. His research was overshadowed by Keys’ hypothesis that cholesterol was the culprit. The sugar industry, especially the high fructose corn syrup industry, is really at the heart of this controversy. Internal documents reveal that the industry bribed scientists to downplay the link between sugar consumption and heart disease, shifting the blame onto saturated fat and cholesterol. This tactic helped to protect the sugar industry's profits while promoting the consumption of sugary products. Additionally, the risk assessment tools used by healthcare providers to determine the need for statins have been found to be inaccurate . These tools often overestimate the risk of heart disease and oversimplify the causes, leading to unnecessary statin prescriptions. A holistic prevention strategy would include foods that reduce inflammation of the cardiovascular system. Fiber-rich foods help modulate cholesterol. Healthy fats, such as avocados , are great. It's the processed foods -- the cookies and cakes with trans fats -- that should be avoided. The widespread belief in the cholesterol-heart disease connection and the indoctrination of healthcare providers has led to the over-prescription of statin drugs in young people. Many individuals who are at low risk of heart disease are being prescribed statins, exposing them to unnecessary side effects which include accelerated aging and mitochondrial dysfunction . In one study, COVID-19 outcomes are more severe for individuals with low cholesterol , suggesting that statin drugs cause immune-deficiencies that lead to worse outcomes for infectious disease. Statins may have applications in old age, but this approach to cardiovascular health should be viewed with caution, especially when these pills are recommended as a one-size-fits-all solution for heart disease prevention in younger and middle-aged adults.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-healthcare-workers-win-arbitration-case-wrongful-termination.html,Canadian healthcare workers who challenged unlawful vaccine mandate WIN arbitration case against hospital that wrongfully terminated them,"A growing number of healthcare workers who were wrongfully terminated by their former employers are taking legal action and WINNING against unlawful vaccine mandates . These workers, who were discriminated against for refusing to comply with mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies, point out the obvious -- that the vaccine mandates violated their legal rights and led to unjust discrimination and job loss. A total of 82 healthcare workers formerly employed with the William Osler Health System (WOHS) in Canada were recently vindicated by a Canadian arbitrator, who ruled that the nation’s leading hospitals must compensate the healthcare workers for wrongful termination. Canadian arbitrator claims vaccine mandate was “reasonable” but vindicates those who were terminated by the mandate Toronto arbitrator John Stout made the ruling on August 12 , vindicating forty healthcare workers who were fired for not getting the COVID shots and relieving another forty-two healthcare workers who were wrongfully suspended. They were represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). “The ESA (Employment Standards Act) provides that unless an employee’s actions amount to ‘willful misconduct, disobedience or willful neglect of duty that is not trivial,’ they will be entitled to termination and severance pay,” Stout ruled. Like nearly every healthcare system in the Western Hemisphere, WOHS implemented an unlawful vaccine mandate for all healthcare workers, subduing all individuals’ body autonomy rights and intimidating them to get injected with two worthless, high-risk COVID shots as a condition for employment. The ruling by Stout was paradoxical. Bound to vaccine propaganda and the dictates of the government, Stout and the other arbiters agreed that “a requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a healthcare setting is reasonable” and that “the grievors in this matter were terminated for just cause.” However, Stout ultimately sided with the “grievors,” ruling that “The employees chose not to be vaccinated and as a result they were not reasonably available to attend at work, which at a minimum severely and negatively impacted the employment relationship.” “That being said, the individual grievors were misguided and their conduct was not with any malicious intent,” he wrote. Stout ultimately ruled: “I find that the individual grievors who were terminated from their employment by the Hospital are entitled to termination and severance pursuant to the ESA.” Healthcare professionals must fight for their lives in a system dominated by vaccine lies and totalitarianism The Canadian government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug Ford, enacted tyrannical vaccine mandates that were opposed in the face of discrimination, segregation and death threats. In recent months, several high-profile cases have emerged highlighting the struggles faced by healthcare professionals who opposed these “vaccine” mandates on grounds of medical, religious or personal reasons. These mandates, issued during the imposition of pandemic propaganda, lacked proper legal and ethical considerations, while violating human rights. According to legal experts, such terminations may contravene federal and state laws designed to protect individuals from discrimination based on medical or religious exemptions. It’s terrifying enough to think that free individuals must seek legal exemptions for something they don’t need, that was created to exploit populations . The discrimination and segregation of these smart health care workers has sparked widespread debate about the totalitarian nature of public health measures and the destruction of individual rights. The forced termination of healthcare professionals during an alleged pandemic, exposed the pandemic as a mass psychosis of fraudulent pandemic marketing and bio-terror propaganda. If the government and the hospital systems were willing to eradicate a large portion of the healthcare sector, then public health authorities weren’t genuinely concerned about staffing over-crowded hospitals and responding to a “pandemic.” By wrongfully terminating nurses and doctors over a fraudulent vaccine, the entire healthcare system is undermined and short staffed, causing further problems in the medical system. That’s exactly what happened across the world, as healthy, unvaccinated individuals were purged from the healthcare sector. Healthcare professionals have learned that they must fight for their lives in a system dominated by vaccine lies and totalitarianism.

Several clear cut examples immediately come to mind, including 9/11, Sandy Hook, Wuhan laboratory and the Trump assassination attempt. Was 9/11 a black swan event or a well-covered-up inside job? Quickly after the black swan event known as 9/11 happened, the Feds scrambled to confiscate any videos anyone had taken that showed the planes flying into the buildings. Why? Were they actual commercial airliners filled with American people, or maybe just some missile-armed-drones disguised to look like them? Also, why was the debris from the World Trade Center buildings RUSHED out to sea and dumped, before anyone could inspect the rubble for explosive chemicals, detonators or other signs that the buildings were not brought to the ground by burning jet fuel, but by well-planned and controlled demolition , per the videos? If the official narrative was correct, that jet fuel burned and melted steel beams into liquid, and even building 7 collapsed due to “office fires” the same day, then why not prove this with evidence, instead of removing all the evidence from the eyes and hands of the public and press ? Did building 7, in fact, contain the blueprint plans for the Twin Towers and other inside information about the controlled demolition of ALL THREE buildings? One thing is for sure – the U.S. government cannot prove that demolition explosives were NOT used for all three buildings. The official story simply does NOT add up. Nobody was ever supposed to question the Sandy Hook massacre, because children died there, or did they? Is it illegal now in America to question ""official narratives?"" Questioning government narratives has become the norm, as it should, because nearly all mass shootings are followed up by hokey stories, crooked politicians and media shills crying about gun confiscation, and a mass-censoring of anyone online who asks intelligent questions. Why were there NO videos of the Sandy Hook school grounds and the named “killer” entering the school, when the school had just installed a high-grade security system just months before the alleged shooting? Why was the coroner laughing about the scene he described with children everywhere dead and dying? Why were about 300 black, white and silver cars (government workers) surrounding the entire school, right after the shooting, blocking all access for emergency vehicles, who may have SAVED some of the shot children, if there really were any? Why were actors caught telling fake stories afterward about the event, and posing as swat team members? Is it illegal in America now to ask questions that challenge “ official narratives ” of the government? Why did 2 billion humans absolutely avoid the Covid-19 mRNA jabs, did they somehow know the pandemic was a planned event, including pushing the deadly “vaccines”? Hindsight is 20/20, as they say, and if you look at the science , the Covid-19 mRNA “clot shots” are just that, as they are proving to clog and clot the vascular system, causing horrific strain on the heart, swelling of the heart muscle, and in many instances, heart attacks and strokes for the injected “victims.” Trillions of spike protein prions (nanoparticles) can join and cause horrific health tragedies for those injected. Are the fully unvaccinated masses “conspiracy theorists” because they suspected this from the outset of the plandemic, or are these natural health advocates actual pro-science, where the evidence reveals dirty vaccines? Could it be that the whole ""gain of function"" virus and the dirty nanoparticle vaccines were ALL planned at the Wuhan lab and funded by Fauci and NIH? This requires careful consideration. How big was the team that planned the Trump assassination? Just a few questions the Secret Service (USSS) and FBI can’t answer, won’t answer and have covered up and destroyed all evidence that would reveal the answers: Who helped Thomas Matthew Crooks prepare and get full access to the closest rooftop to Trump? Why was the body of Crooks cremated without an autopsy to show how many bullets hit him, from how many angles and how many guns? Why did the FBI confiscate videos people captured that revealed evidence of multiple shooters, USSS massive failures and local police ineptitudes? Why the big cover up afterward if there’s no “conspiracy” to hide ? Where are the videos, the drone footage and information on the obvious second shooter at the water tower?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-tim-walz-lied-about-wife-undergoing-ivf.html,Tim Walz lied during campaign speech about his wife undergoing IVF,"Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz has claimed during his campaign speeches that the issue of access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is ""personal"" to him and his family because his wife used this procedure to conceive their two children. He apparently lied, and the person who revealed that he was not telling the truth was none other than his wife, Gwen Walz. ""Some of you may have heard this. [IVF] is personal for my wife and I. When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach and then the agony when I heard the treatments hadn't worked,"" he said in a rally in Wisconsin earlier this month. ""So it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope."" He told the same story during another campaign speech in Arizona, even pretending to be moved to tears. But in a statement to CNN , Gwen clarified that they tried intrauterine insemination (IUI), a process she described as ""an incredibly personal and difficult experience"" – and not IVF. ""Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time, not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family. The only person who knew in detail what we were going through was our next-door neighbor,"" she said in the statement. ""She was a nurse and helped me with the shots I needed as part of the IUI process. I'd rush home from school and she would give me the shots to ensure we stayed on track."" Intrauterine insemination is a common fertility procedure used by couples trying to conceive. However, anti-abortion groups have pushed state officials to restrict IVF when an egg is removed from a person's body and combined with sperm inside a lab before being implanted. During IUI, sperm is placed directly in the uterus . The process is sometimes combined with ovulation induction, where medication stimulates the release of eggs. People experiencing infertility often start with IUI and move on to IVF if needed. Though usually confused to be the same, critics find it hard to believe that Walz did not know what exactly they had to go through to address their fertility woes. He was not confused just once, but twice. Harris campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg explained the Minnesota governor's prior use of the term IVF to describe his family's fertility issues by saying, ""Governor Walz talks how normal people talk. He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments."" Walz faces backlash over IVF and IUI confusion As Walz and the Dems put IVF as a central part of their election 2024 campaign, the VP candidate is now facing backlash over his confusion about the two fertility procedures. His political rival and Republican Vice President nominee JG Vance slammed Walz for lying . He blasted him during a campaign speech in Milwaukee, saying, ""It's just such a bizarre thing to lie about, right? There's nothing wrong with having a baby through IVF or not having a baby through IVF. Like, why lie about it? I just don't understand that."" ""Anybody who's had a friend or themselves on fertility treatment, you know the difference,"" he added. But the distinction matters politically because IUI doesn't risk destroying unused embryos that anti-abortion advocates equate to unborn children. After Roe v. Wade was overturned, some anti-abortion groups began pushing for restrictions on IVF care. In February, Alabama's Supreme Court ruled embryos created by IVF treatments should be considered children, creating a pathway for the procedure to potentially be restricted under the state's abortion law. Gwen pointed to the Alabama ruling as one of the reasons she and Walz began sharing their fertility struggles. Meanwhile, X user Greg Price created a list of Walz's deceptive statements and posted them on the social media platform. He said: ""Update on the lies that Tim Walz has told: Being an Afghan veteran, being a command sergeant major, conceiving his children through IVF, knowing his unit was being deployed, carrying weapons into war, being a head football coach and lying about being deaf to get out of [driving under the influence] DUI.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-camu-camu-superfood-reverse-fatty-liver-disease.html,The hidden benefits of camu camu: This Amazonian superfruit may help reverse non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"For years, doctors have faced challenges in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition affecting over 25 percent of adults globally. But a recent discovery points to an unexpected remedy: the camu camu berr y from the Amazon rainforest. NAFLD is marked by fat buildup in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, scarring and even liver failure if not addressed. It’s closely associated with diabetes, metabolic disorders and obesity, making it a significant health concern as global obesity rates climb. Currently, there are no approved medications for NAFLD, leaving diet and exercise as the primary treatments for this disease. This is why researchers are examining the camu camu berry, a small red fruit native to the Amazon rainforest. The berry is rich in antioxidants, fiber and polyphenols – plant compounds with evidence-based health benefits. The camu camu berry, a small red fruit native to the Amazon, is rich in antioxidants, fiber and polyphenols–plant compounds with evidence-based health benefits . In this study, 30 obese or overweight adults with high triglycerides were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were split into two groups: one received 1.5 grams of camu camu powder daily, while the other got a placebo (maltodextrin) for 12 weeks, followed by a four-week break before switching treatments. Researchers focused on measuring liver fat content using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with other indicators of liver and metabolic health and changes in gut bacteria. After 12 weeks, those taking camu camu saw a notable 15.85 percent reduction in liver fat, while the placebo group experienced an 8.42 percent increase. Camu camu also lowered liver enzymes ALT and AST , which are markers of liver damage. Additionally, the camu camu group had beneficial changes in their gut microbiome , including more good bacteria, like Lactobacillus , and fewer harmful ones linked to NAFLD. However, there were no changes in body weight or overall body fat between the two groups. ( Related: Camu camu ground to speed up metabolism and reduce weight gain .) Evidence-based health benefits of camu camu Scientifically known as Myrciaria dubia , camu camu has more proven health benefits . Here are some of them: Rich in vitamins and minerals Camu camu stands out for its high vitamin C content. Vitamin C helps with boosting the immune system, collagen production, iron absorption and wound healing. A 100-gram serving of camu camu fruit pulp contains between 877 to 3,133 milligrams of vitamin C , although levels can vary depending on where the plant is grown. Besides vitamin C, camu camu also provides calcium, copper, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sodium and zinc. Boosts the immune system The antioxidants in camu camu, including anthocyanins, support immune health by affecting key immune cells (dendritic cells, lymphocytes and macrophages). Vitamin C in camu camu helps keep cells healthy by protecting them from damage caused by harmful molecules produced during inflammation. It boosts the ability of immune cells to engulf and destroy harmful particles and germs (phagocytosis). Vitamin C also helps white blood cells, called neutrophils, move to infection sites to fight off invaders. At the same time, it helps prevent too much damage to tissues by supporting the natural process of cell death and clearing away damaged cells. Has anti-bacterial, anti-malarial and anti-viral properties Research has identified various beneficial bioactive compounds in camu camu, such as polyphenols and those correlated with anti-parasitic properties which could be useful in treating diseases, like malaria and schistosomiasis. Seed extracts have shown potential as sources for new treatments. Supports healthy blood sugar levels Research published in the open access, peer-reviews journal Metabolites showed that the lowest dose of camu camu extract effectively reduced non-HDL cholesterol, which includes all the harmful types of cholesterol and free fatty acids. Only the highest dose of camu camu extract prevented fat accumulation, issues related to high-fat diets, such as insulin resistance , liver cholesterol buildup, liver triglyceride accumulation and weight gain. Both low and high doses of the fruit extract were found to be effective in lowering blood sugar levels and enhancing glucose tolerance. Promotes eye health With its high content of vitamin E and carotenoids, camu camu helps protect against eye damage and can slow the progression of age-related conditions, like cataracts and macular degeneration. Improves oral and gum health Camu camu’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties can help combat gingivitis and other gum disease. It reduces oxidative stress, which can otherwise lead to gum and periodontal concerns. Supports cardiovascular health Camu camu is beneficial for heart health. It can improve blood pressure and promote better blood flow – helping protect the heart and arteries from diseases.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-uk-nurses-deny-healthcare-to-illegal-immigration-opposers.html,U.K. nurses plan to deny healthcare to anyone opposing unlimited illegal immigration,"A registered trade union for those in the profession of nursing in the U.K. has just issued new guidelines on situations where they can refuse to treat and withdraw care from patients and this includes clients who would oppose illegal migration because they deem them ""racists."" The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) indicated in the Aug. 6 updated guidelines that some situations may justify refusing treatment, withdrawing care or finding an alternative. ""In response to comments made by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, we've updated our guidance on when and how members can refuse to treat a patient in their care. We recognize that every patient interaction is unique and this will be the most difficult decision for RCN members,"" RCN said in a statement on its website . According to RCN, the new set of rules is related to the ongoing racist attacks. It claimed that most of them have targeted nursing staff. The health secretary reportedly expressed commitment to dealing with the ""racist abuse of all health workers"" and decided that this is grounds for turning away patients. ""I am demanding the government ensures anybody targeting our members pays a very heavy price. Hearing that nurses going to work in Sunderland came under attack is unforgivable,"" Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN general secretary and chief executive said. ""Migrant nursing staff are precious members of our communities, hardwired into the very DNA of our health and care services. Our international colleagues are welcome, valued and owed a debt of gratitude."" RCN said that ""racism has no place in our society"" and as an anti-racist organization, it will take a lead part in tackling this hatred. The guidelines indicate that nurses can decline and stop treating patients in the following circumstances: ""Where there exists, or there is fear of, physical violence; where there is discriminatory behavior, including racism ; where there are health and safety hazards e.g. lack of appropriate equipment; where the care required is outside the scope of competence or training; where there is a conscientious objection, where the client/patient is known to you in a personal capacity and where you are asked to do something unlawful or in breach of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Code."" For healthcare entrepreneur Jonathan Engler, this professional body essentially acting as a social justice organization, ""represents an egregious abandonment of longstanding ethical principles "" – especially when this particular organization is ""simply parroting the government position that anyone who expresses any concern whatsoever about unfettered immigration must automatically be a racist."" Engler pointed out the particular entry that determines the discriminatory behavior of the patients. ""Who is to judge what is racist? Are 95-year-olds who don't keep up with the latest approved language and use outmoded words such as 'colored' to be refused treatment because they are ""racist?'"" ""The whole point of sacrosanct ethical principles (and inalienable rights for that matter) is that they don't depend on the prevailing circumstances, since the consideration of such leaves far too much room for post-hoc justification of leaving patients frighteningly vulnerable to the ideological whims of their careers,"" he argued. (Related: Dying man refused right to try ivermectin, put on ventilator in a hospital that REFUSES to administer treatments that work .) SRA supports totalitarianism and suppression of speech Meanwhile, the Solicitor's Regulatory Authority (SRA), the body responsible for regulating the professional conduct of more than 125,000 solicitors and other authorized individuals at more than 11,000 firms, as well as those working in-house at private and public sector organizations in England and Wales, is also following a totalitarian ideology mirrored in the new RCN guidelines. Solicitor Lois Bayliss has been accused by the SRA of acting ""against mainstream science"" because she sent out anti-vaccine letters. The SRA alleged that for less than three weeks in February 2022, she sent letters to up to 450 individuals at up to 237 schools and general practitioner surgeries threatening that recipients would face criminal and civil liability. Bayliss applied to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal to be allowed to adduce expert statements on medicine and ethics when her case is heard in September. Dr. Peter Fields said the solicitor had a right to use this evidence to defend herself in light of assumptions being made in the SRA's case. But the tribunal rejected the application, urging both parties to focus on the nature of the allegations rather than enter into wider discussions about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines. SRA ruled that she needed to be able to bring experts who would provide an alternative view. What happened with the SRA case is ""consistent with the complete lack of debate permitted anywhere by any major government around the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines and this appears to be an example of a supposedly independent institution doing the government's dirty work in suppressing debate,"" Expose 's Rhoda Wilson commented.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-ultra-vaccinated-dr-fauci-suffers-third-covid.html,Ultra-vaccinated Dr. FAUCI suffers THIRD case of COVID which somehow devolved into West Nile infection,"The ultra-vaccinated, routinely-masked Dr. Anthony Fauci recently suffered from a reported THIRD case of COVID in August. That COVID eventually devolved into an extremely rare West Nile infection that required further hospitalization and isolation. Stupidity of “The Science” on full display Right now, “the Science” himself is reeling from serious immune failure that was imparted by the biological weapons (COVID-19 vaccines) that he locked Americans down for and mandated for the financial benefit of NIAID scientists such as himself . Despite avoiding crowds, routinely choking on his own carbon dioxide and not attending his own daughter’s wedding , his third case of COVID and subsequent West Nile infection has led to severe illness and hospitalization. After being hospitalized for six days, the 83-year-old former director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) is now at home trying to recuperate. According to the definition of West Nile virus, his symptoms have included body aches, diarrhea, fever and rash. Since the COVID scandal began, these symptoms have, at one time or another, been labeled “COVID,” but in this case, doctors are calling Fauci’s severe illness “West Nile.” ""Tony Fauci has been hospitalized with a case of West Nile virus. He is now home and is recovering. A full recovery is expected,"" said a spokesperson for the beleaguered public health servant. Heavily-vaccinated Fauci is still getting sick and hospitalized, despite vaccine narratives Since 2021, Fauci has reportedly taken the initial two-dose COVID-19 vaccine series, along with an additional six booster shots . He is also routinely jabbed for flu strains, year after year. Fauci, who has recently warned about respiratory syncytial virus, is most likely vaccinated with the newest RSV vaccines, too - according to federal guidelines for adults older than 60 . Interestingly, Fauci has no idea where these body aches, diarrhea, fever and rash came from or how he got this West Nile diagnosis. West Nile is a vector borne disease and requires contact with mosquitoes. For the most part, the man lives in a bubble and is not in contact with things like mosquitoes. Even if he did have contact with mosquitoes, West Nile is extremely rare. According to the CDC, there have only been 216 human cases of West Nile reported across 33 states this year. The strange West Nile hospitalization comes at a time when Fauci was struggling with his third COVID infection. One of the narratives throughout the covid-19 scandal claims that the vaccinated experience a mild infection, are not hospitalized, and do not suffer severe infection. While Fauci was hospitalized for a week, having a West Nile diagnosis helps cover up the original COVID diagnosis, protecting the “vaccines-prevent-hospitalization” narrative. Regardless, he is sick and hospitalized and should receive our sympathy. Isn’t it strange, he isn’t getting sympathy this time around because of the lies he has told and the way he has abused his role. In 2021, Fauci infamously declared with certainty: ""If you get vaccinated, you are protected,"" and ""When people get vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not gonna get infected."" He has been wrong, time and time again, and has been exposed lying about everything related to infectious disease . Either way, the man continues to suffer from his own advice, contracting the very disease that should have been prevented years ago with his persistent social distancing, lockdowns, avoidance of people and routine vaccinations and boosters. The germaphobia, vaccination model of immunization continues to be proven fraudulent , and Dr. Fauci, along with other government leaders who pushed vaccines, are in the spotlight proving that none of it works, with their immune systems and cognitive function failing.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-sermon-018-mike-adams-pomegranate-natural-medicine.html,Sermon 18: Mike Adams discusses the POMEGRANATE fruit as natural medicine and miracle from God,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams discussed the pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) as both a natural medicine and a ""miracle from God and Mother Nature"" during his 18th sermon on the ""Health Ranger Report,"" part of his 100 Sermons series. According to Adams, the miracles of creation help purify a person's blood, body and brain. Physically cleansing the body from toxins, cancer cells, parasites and others is the appropriate way to do this. One way to achieve this purification is through pomegranates, which have been associated with being close to God and higher spiritual acuity. ""In other words, the pathway to get closer to God is to first purify your body,"" Adams said. ""And it is these fruits like pomegranate and other superfoods that allow us to do that."" The Natural News and Brighteon.com founder noted that P. granatum contains ""powerful anti-cancer nutrients and anti-parasitic nutrients."" These nutrients called polyphenols include betulinic acid, ursolic acid and gallic acid. These three are all recognized as experimental anti-tumor agents, with gallic acid being known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties . Adams stressed that while the sweet and crunchy pomegranate seeds contain antioxidants, the fruit's bitter parts – particularly the inner rind – contain its cancer-fighting compounds. (Related: Pomegranate juice has DRAMATIC effects in slowing the development of prostate cancer .) Moreover, the Health Ranger cited James Duke's 2007 work ""Herbs of the Bible"" for other ailments that pomegranate addresses. Such health issues include infertility, estrogen deficiency, inflammation of the eyelid, bronchitis, painful menstruation, mouth sores and sore throat. Pomegranate's bitter parts can be used against PARASITES According to Adams, the pomegranate's rich color – caused by the various tannins that are synthesized in the plant – makes it very useful for tanning leather and dyeing textiles. It is even made into wine and added to salads. P. granatum , which is known as an astringent and an aphrodisiac, has also been used across multiple cultures. In the Philippines, its leaves are used for oral aliments while its flowers were used in ancient Persia to relieve painful gums. India's Ayurvedic medicine tradition also lauds the pomegranate , Adams continued. Pomegranate rind is used to treat worms and parasites, diarrhea and dysentery. Meanwhile, pomegranate bark and seeds are used to treat bronchitis. Just like in Ayurveda, the pomegranate's real benefits come with the use of the rind. The bitter compounds in the rind kill the parasites already in a person's digestive tract. Moreover, Adams also mentioned that pomegranate leaves contain nutrients that inhibit viruses . ""We have an antiviral drug, so to speak. We have textile dyes, we have anti-cancer nutrients, we have nutrients that treat fertility. Now, pomegranates are especially known for helping to prevent prostate cancer. No wonder God sees pomegranates as a blessing onto humanity,"" he said. ""If there's one fruit that most closely indicates the message from God of the abundance of food and medicine in a bright, beautiful package that technically needs no pesticides or herbicides – that's already sort of pest resistant because of the hard outer shell – pomegranates fit the bill. And this is why I think pomegranates have long been associated with abundance."" Follow Superfoods.news for more stories about the pomegranate fruit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-infanticide-numbers-continue-rise-thanks-to-telehealth-abortions.html,"Post-Roe infanticide numbers continue to rise, thanks to TELEHEALTH ABORTIONS","Telehealth abortions were responsible for the reversal of a decline in infanticide numbers following the 2022 overturn of the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling, an op-ed argues. Jonathon Von Maren put forward this argument in an Aug. 14 piece on LifeSiteNews , which featured his interview with pro-life statistician and political scientist Dr. Michael New. He cited numbers released by the U.S. Society of Family Planning (SFP) as part of its #WeCount projects to back up his case. According to the group's estimates, abortion numbers continue to rise . The SFP found that in the first three months of 2024, the number of abortions increased by 13.8 percent. It also found that during the same period, 20 percent of all abortions were done via telehealth – something Von Maren described as ""alarming."" ""When a woman obtains a telehealth abortion, she is mailed chemical abortion pills without an in-person medical exam. Telehealth abortions are self-reported by companies that send abortion pills through the mail. This raises questions about the accuracy of these abortion estimates,"" he wrote. ""These companies may have incentives to inflate their numbers. Furthermore, the fact that abortion pills were ordered does not necessarily mean that an abortion was obtained. Some women might have changed their minds. Others might have ordered chemical-abortion pills for future use."" (Related: Kamala Harris: Owned by Big Pharma, big trans, and big abortion .) Von Maren continued that the increased availability of chemical drugs is causing the rise in abortions. He also noted the Biden administration's role in making these abortifacient drugs more accessible. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the gestational age limit for chemical abortions from seven weeks to 10 weeks. It also allowed nurse practitioners and other medical professionals that same year to prescribe mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in chemical abortions alongside misoprostol. Also in 2016, the FDA approved a dosing regimen – requiring women obtaining chemical abortions to make only one visit to a health care professional instead of three. The regulator later announced in 2021 that the one-visit requirement would no longer be enforced. Shield laws contributed to rise in chemical abortions Citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Von Maren said the percentage of chemically induced infanticide out of all abortions increased from 30.3 percent to 56 percent between 2016 and 2021. He continued: ""It should not come as a surprise that after a fairly consistent 36 year decline, the U.S. abortion rate increased in 2017 and has increased since that time."" In the first quarter of this year, more than 27,000 telehealth abortions took place under shield laws – more than nine percent of the total. Shield laws, which are in effect in six blue states, provide legal protection to medical professionals who send chemical abortion pills into states with legal protections for pre-born children. ""The abortion pill presents a new era in the abortion wars,"" New told Von Maren. ""Pro-lifers need to prioritize preventing chemical abortions."" To achieve this goal, he suggested three strategies pro-lifers can take – first of which is using litigation against the FDA . According to New, it can be strongly argued that the FDA did not follow its own rules regarding testing and safety when they eased access to chemical abortion drugs in 2016 and 2021. A second strategy is using litigation to invalidate shield laws . The pro-life political scientist noted that attorneys general in several red states are reportedly mulling various litigation strategies against the six blue states with shield laws in place. Lastly, New suggested electing a pro-life president as a third strategy. He expressed hope that the pro-life president would simply appoint FDA personnel who would limits on the shipment and use of chemical abortion drugs if elected. ""Donald Trump has certainly not made any promises to place limits on chemical abortions. However, his FDA appointees would certainly be more sympathetic to the concerns of pro-lifers than an appointees made by Kamala Harris,"" New remarked. Visit Abortions.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-27-lycopene-harnessing-natural-carotenoids-for-cancer-prevention.html,Lycopene: Harnessing natural carotenoids for cancer prevention,"Lycopene, a red pigment in fruits and vegetables like beets, cherries, guavas, papayas, pink grapefruits, red onions, red peppers, tomatoes and strawberries, has attracted considerable interest from scientists in recent years. Research, including a 2023 study published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy reveals that higher levels of lycopene in the blood are associated with a lower risk of developing different types of cancer. Lycopene stands out for its powerful antioxidant properties, which are much stronger than beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol. It helps protect against cancer by slowing tumor growth and preventing cancer formation. Lycopene works through two main methods: Antioxidant action. It neutralizes harmful radicals and reduces oxidative stress, which can damage DNA, lipids and protein. Non-antioxidant action. It inhibits the growth of cancer cells, corrects abnormal cell signaling, enhances communication between cells and adjusts levels of growth factors. In essence, lycopene's protective effects come from its ability to combat oxidative damage and its impact on cancer and cell behavior. (Related: Phytonutrients: Natural compounds in plant foods that help lower cancer risk .) Breast cancer A study published in Cancer Science highlights that carotenoids, primarily lycopene, found in pink-to-red fruits and vegetables, may help prevent breast cancer. Lycopene works in several ways, including fighting oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, stopping cancer cell growth and triggering cell death (apoptosis). The research suggests that eating more carotenoids, especially lycopene-rich foods, is linked to a lower risk of developing estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer but not ER-positive breast cancer. This conclusion comes from an analysis of 18 different studies. (Related: 6 Good reasons to eat more beets .) Colon and colorectal cancers A study published in The FASEB (Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology) Journal showed that lycopene can significantly slow down the growth of colon cancer cells in the lab ( in vitro ). In tests with mice, lycopene also prevented the growth and spread of colorectal tumors. (Related: The antioxidant lycopene is effective against colon cancer .) Using advanced imaging and staining techniques, researchers found that lycopene effectively reduced tumor growth and progression . It did this by lowering levels of certain proteins linked to cancer and increasing the levels of protective proteins. Lycopene also decreased markers associated with inflammation and cancer cell growth. These findings suggest that lycopene could help prevent colorectal cancer by stopping tumors from growing and spreading in mice. Endometrial cancer A study published in Nutrition and Cancer found that lycopene is more effective than alpha- or beta-carotene at stopping the growth of endometrial cancer cells. When tested in vitro , lycopene significantly reduced the proliferation of these cells at lower concentrations compared to the other carotenoids. Generally, you would need four times as much alpha-carotene or 10 times as much beta-carotene to achieve the same growth inhibition as lycopene. The effect was noticeable after 24 hours and lasted at least three days. Besides slowing down the growth of cancer cells , lycopene also reduces growth stimulated by insulin-like factors important to the development of various cancers. These findings suggest that lycopene might offer new insights into how endometrial cancer, and potentially other types of tumors, form. Gastric or stomach cancer A 2023 study published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry explored how lycopene affects stomach cancer cells. The research found that lycopene slowed the growth of cancer cells without harming normal stomach cells. In the study, lycopene was shown to stop cancer cells from growing, causing them to undergo programmed cell death and disrupting their energy production. These effects were observed in specific cancer cell lines but did not affect normal stomach cells or a particular cell with a TP53 mutation. Further analysis identified 57 genes in stomach cancer that were influenced by lycopene treatment. The study found that lycopene reduced protein levels linked to cell cycle progression and increased protein levels associated with cancer suppression in cancer cells. Overall, lycopene could be a promising treatment for stomach cancer, especially in cases with specific genetic changes. Lung cancer A study published in Cancers suggests that lycopene may help prevent lung cancer. Research shows that lycopene can slow the growth of lung cancer cells in lab settings and stop tumors from forming in animal models. It works through several modes, including changing the behavior or enzymes related to cell growth, improving cell communication, reducing smoke-induced inflammation, regulating growth factors, stopping cancer cell growth and triggering cancer cell death . Lycopene blocks cancer cells from spreading, forming new blood cells and invading other tissues. Scientists have found several byproducts of lycopene, which might also contribute to its cancer-fighting effects. While these findings are promising, more detailed clinical trials are needed to understand exactly how lycopene helps prevent lung cancer. Future studies should carefully choose participants, measure specific markers, test different levels of carotenoids and consider how lycopene interacts with other nutrients. Ovarian cancer Research published in the American Journal of Cancer Research found that lycopene helps reduce the growth of ovarian tumors and the spread of cancer within the abdomen. In studies with mice, lycopene significantly lowered the spread of ovarian cancer and shrank existing tumors . Another study published in Molecular and Cellular Probes showed that lycopene slows down the growth and promotes the death of ovarian cancer cells – specifically in a cell line identified as SKOV3 from a patient with ovarian adenocarcinoma. Prostate cancer A 2020 study in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy found that lycopene effectively slows the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells in vitro and animal tests. It also helps cancer-related signaling pathways. Eat your way to better health Lycopene is commonly found in a variety of pink-to-red produce . Tomatoes are the best and most popular source choice, especially when ripe. You can also get lycopene from canned, fresh, pureed and sun-dried tomatoes, cooked sweet red peppers, guavas, papayas, pink grapefruit, watermelon and more. There is no official daily recommendation for lycopene but studies suggest that consuming eight to 21 milligrams daily is beneficial. Precautions: While lycopene supplements can be helpful, it is important to be cautious with high doses as they might have unwanted side effects so always consult your doctor. In rare cases, eating extremely high amounts of lycopene-rich foods can cause a condition called lycopenodermia, which results in a change in skin color.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-study-link-weight-loss-drugs-increase-suicidality.html,DYING TO LOSE WEIGHT: Study finds alarming link between popular weight loss drugs and increase in suicidality,"A new study has found a link between the active ingredient in popular weight loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy and a 45% higher likelihood of suicidal ideation. It's a significant finding that prompted the authors of the study to write that it “warrants urgent clarification.” The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Network Open , was based on an analysis of the World Health Organization ’s adverse drug events database. To reach their conclusion, they compared reporting rates of suicidal ideation and other suicide-related behaviors for individuals taking semaglutide as well as another weight loss medication that falls into the same class of drugs, liraglutide. When they compared these suicidal ideation rates to those of all the other drugs listed in the WHO database, they found a shocking 45% higher likelihood of suicidal ideation linked to semaglutide. Among those who reported suicidal effects from taking semaglutide, 86% experienced suicidal ideation, while 6.5% attempted suicide and another 6.5% attempted to overdose. Sadly, discontinuing the drug only caused suicidal ideation to go away 62% of the time. Medical University of South Carolina psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor Patrick O'Neil pointed out that as central nervous system drugs, the possibility of psychiatric adverse events with these medications needs to be considered. He told The Epoch Times : “Most of the drugs that have been studied for the management of obesity are central nervous system drugs. And so there’s long been a concern about any psychiatric adverse events associated with those drugs, be it anxiety, insomnia, depression, any of these things.” The researchers noted that roughly half of the suicidality cases they identified took place among people who were using the drugs off label. Although these drugs were originally intended for patients with diabetes, they are often used off label to help people lose weight. Unfortunately, the increase in suicidality skyrockets for those who take semaglutide in conjunction with anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants. This combination has been linked to a 150 to 300% increase in suicidality. Chiara Gastaldon, the study’s lead author and a research fellow for the WHO, cautioned: “We suggest that physicians prescribing semaglutide should inform their patients about the medications’ risks and assess the psychiatric history and evaluate the mental state of patients before starting treatment.” The FDA investigated this issue earlier this year, and although they said at the time that they could not find a link between suicidal thoughts and popular weight loss medications, they cautioned that they were unable to definitively rule out the possibility that “a small risk may exist” and promised to keep monitoring patients for side effects. The patient information that is included in the packaging of semaglutide medication already contains a warning to watch out for suicidal thoughts and depression. Semaglutide already linked to a number of serious side effects Semaglutide works by mimicking a hormone the body produces naturally after eating known as GLP-1. This causes users to feel fuller for a longer time. Some of the common side effects of these drugs include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. However, some patients also experience more serious side effects such as sudden vision loss, optic nerve damage, pancreatitis, thyroid tumors, kidney failure, gall bladder problems and hypoglycemia. There have also been reports of gastroparesis, which is a paralysis of the stomach related to delayed gastric emptying. For some patients, the drug is so effective at suppressing appetite that they experience malnutrition. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the long-term effects of using these drugs for weight loss are not known and could be even more severe. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-governor-vance-go-through-pregnancy-after-assault.html,Liberal governor says J.D. Vance should have to “go through” pregnancy after rape,"Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is under fire for hateful comments he made suggesting he wants former President Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, to have to deal with a pregnancy caused by rape. Beshear, who has been conducting interviews in support of Vice President Kamala Harris’s bid for the presidency, made the comments while appearing on MSNBC , where he accused Vance of not having respect for women’s “reproductive freedoms.” He told ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski: “J.D. Vance calls pregnancy resulting from rape ‘inconvenient’. Inconvenience is traffic! Make him go through this!” Vance was quick to call him out for his disgusting comment on X, formerly Twitter, writing: “What the hell is this? Why is [Andy Beshear] wishing that a member of my family would get raped?!?” Vance’s communications director, William Martin, called Beshear’s comments “ vile and disgusting ”, saying: “We call on Kamala Harris to immediately repudiate Governor Beshear’s comments and demonstrate that regardless of partisan disagreements, this kind of violent rhetoric has no place in our public discourse.” However, a defiant Beshear only doubled down on his comments when he appeared on MSNBC again later the same day, when he told Andrea Mitchell: “He’s trying to make himself the victim. As a man, J.D. Vance will never have to face any of this personally. But it’s sad that he lacks the empathy to be able to put himself in a different position.” His attack stems from an interview in 2021 in which Vance shared his views on abortion exceptions for cases of rape. When Democrats accused him of calling rape “inconvenient” based on these remarks during his Senate run a year later, even fact-checkers had to admit that he never said rape was “inconvenient”, instead saying that society should not think of pregnancies caused by rape as inconvenient. DNC focusing on abortion rights with Planned Parenthood ""carnival"" outside convention center Abortion rights have played a central role in the Democratic National Convention, with three women talking about their traumatic pregnancy experiences at the DNC on Monday night and President Joe Biden warning Americans that Trump will “do everything to ban abortion nationwide” should he win the election – despite the fact that Trump has stated he would return the issue to each state to decide, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood has parked a bus just outside of the convention center in Chicago, where they are offering free abortions and vasectomies to those who want them; they claim they have so many takers that they are fully booked all week. They are also handing out prescriptions for abortion pills, and patients can take them home with them or take them at the site. The bus is set up inside a fenced parking lot and guarded by several security officers. Pro-life groups are protesting, and some have even set up a van of their own that offers ultrasounds and medications to reverse abortion pills. Americans United for Life CEO John Mize criticized the “carnival” nature of the Planned Parenthood setup, telling Fox News : ""It's being diminished, and it's being disrespected, the fact that this is a very complicated, very complex decision that these women are making, and, unfortunately, it's a carnival. They have blow-ups. They have food trucks. It's a bit of a show, unfortunately, and it diminishes the severity and significance of vulnerable women."" This is clearly a party that does not value human life and is proud of it, and it’s very unlikely that Harris or anyone else is going to renounce Beshear’s hateful comments. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-hhs-bankrolls-ai-tool-combat-vaccine-misinfo.html,HHS bankrolls AI tool to combat supposed MISINFORMATION about HPV injections,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is reportedly bankrolling an initiative involving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) against so-called ""misinformation"" about vaccines. The Defender reported that HHS has earmarked $4 million for the ""Inoculate for HPV Vaccine"" randomized clinical trial (RCT), citing grant documents obtained by Children's Health Defense (CHD) through a Freedom of Information Act request. The National Cancer Institute, part of the HHS, is facilitating funding for the RCT – which runs from April 2022 through March 2027. Funding for its third year was released in April, the Defender added. University of Pennsylvania associate professor of nursing Melanie Kornides leads the RCT, where she is joined by experts in digital health communication and machine learning, software and program designers and social media analysts. They will help her run the study on 2,500 parents of children aged eight to 12. Kornides' team is collecting user data from YouTube, X, Facebook and Instagram – with their focus being on spaces where people talk about the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are also using natural language processing to train an AI tool to identify ""HPV misinformation"" or posts critical of vaccination, regardless of whether the information in them is true or false. (Related: HHS deploys AI robots to “inoculate” social media users against HPV vaccine ""misinformation."" ) The AI tool will then be exposed to subjects in three study arms, making use of different types of messaging. The control group will get no particular messaging, while two experimental groups will be exposed either to messaging designed to inoculate viewers against content critical of HPV vaccines or content critical of anti-vaccine arguments. The experimental groups will get ""booster"" doses of messaging at three and six months after their first exposure. According to the researchers, this approach against so-called ""misinformation"" can be used in ""wide-scale social media campaigns"" addressing pandemics, childhood vaccination and other health issues if it ends up being successful. They also wrote that misinformation about the HPV vaccine is a major cause of ""vaccine hesitancy."" While such messages circulate widely among well-meaning people, these often come from ""anti-vaccine organizations."" ""Misinformation"" being cited as an excuse for medical censorship According to the Defender , the researchers found that the AI tool deemed several posts on X with valid points as ""misinformation."" These posts often centered on vaccine effectiveness and safety, adverse events related to these injections and their lack of safety monitoring. Posts with claims about Big Pharma profiteering and the government being in cahoots with it were also deemed as such. Moreover, two posts on X verified by mainstream media outlets as legitimate were also dismissed as false. The first post involved Dr. Diane Harper, one of the lead researchers for the Gardasil HPV injection, criticizing her creation. The second post involved a 16-year-old Chicago teen being given the HPV injection without the knowledge or consent of her parents. But for CHD President and General Counsel Mary Holland, the RCT led by Kornides appears to be ""a sign of weakness."" She continued: ""This just proves yet again that anything that deviates from the orthodoxy in public health is considered misinformation."" "" When you are censoring information , labeling it misinformation and smearing us, this is a sign that they've lost the science and are now in a verbal food right. It's just a sign that they are going to lose."" Watch Dr. Sheri Tenpenny elaborating on the various side effects of the HPV vaccine below.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-edible-seaweed-reduce-nerve-damage-prevent-parkinsons.html,Japanese study finds edible brown seaweed called kajime can reduce nerve damage and prevent Parkinson’s disease,"The brown marine alga Ecklonia cava can protect against nerve damage and help prevent Parkinson's disease , according to a study published in the journal Nutrients . Also known in Japan as ""kajime,"" this seaweed belongs to the kelp family and thrives in the Pacific’s warm coastal waters. Researchers investigated how the antioxidants and polyphenols in kajime could help prevent Parkinson's by conducting tests on both animal models and cell cultures. Associate professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa of Osaka Metropolitan University , one of the study's authors, noted that kajime is abundant in phlorotannins, a type of polyphenol found exclusively in brown algae that possess powerful antioxidant properties. (Related: Seaweed prevents Parkinson’s disease, according to new study .) Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes difficulties with movement, general body control and speech. It is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally next to Alzheimer's disease. Kojima-Yuasa noted that the study used a mouse model to explore the potential protective effects of kajime polyphenols and to understand the biological mechanisms at play. Parkinson's is triggered by the degeneration of neurons that produce dopamine , a neurotransmitter critical for cognitive processes and movement. The precise cause of this nerve cell loss remains uncertain. According to the study, the antioxidants in kajime may help prevent nerve damage by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) -- free radicals that can damage cellular components such as DNA and proteins. The study found that kajime extract can activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) enzyme , which helps regulate cell metabolism and promotes energy production and recovery. Minimizing the production of reactive oxygen species is critical as these harmful molecules can damage dopaminergic neurons, which are responsible for regulating dopamine neurotransmitters. Currently, treatment options for Parkinson's disease focus solely on managing symptoms, highlighting the urgent need for new therapies and preventive strategies. Seaweed extract able to reverse motor impairments In this study, researchers tested motor function in mice by feeding them kajime extract for a week before orally giving them rotenone, a chemical commonly used as an herbicide and pesticide that is known to cause nerve damage. The results showed that the motor impairments caused by rotenone were reversed after treatment with kajime extract. The mice also showed improvements in intestinal motor function and the structural integrity of the colon's mucosal tissue. Additional cellular experiments reinforced the protective role of kajime. In particular, they revealed that the antioxidants in kajime seaweed can activate the AMPK enzyme, a key regulator in cellular energy, and reduce the production of ROS which are linked to neuronal cell death. The researchers noted that oral administration of rotenone led to motor and gastrointestinal dysfunction in the mice, but these effects were effectively counteracted by the administration of kajime polyphenols. Kojima-Yuasa stressed that kajime's antioxidants can protect neurons by activating AMPK and reducing ROS production. She expressed hope that this seaweed could become an important ingredient in preventing Parkinson's disease. A previous study published in Marine Drugs already reported the ability of kajime polyphenols to help prevent liver fibrosis and alcoholic liver disease .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-the-science-locks-down-new-england-towns.html,The Science™ locks down four New England towns for ‘extremely rare’ virus after SINGLE infection,"Due to a single case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), four towns in New England are now subject to “voluntary” lockdowns for the foreseeable future, at least until the onset of winter. (Article republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Via New York Post (emphasis added): “ Four Massachusetts towns — Douglas, Oxford, Sutton and Webster — have enacted a voluntary evening lockdown in an attempt to curb the spread of a potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease. The decision comes after the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed the first human case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) since 2020 in Worcester County. On Wednesday, the Oxford Board of Health voted to support the recommendation for people to remain indoors after 6:00 p.m ., effective immediately, through Sept. 30, according to a public health advisory shared with Fox News Digital. Starting on Oct. 1, the recommendation is to remain indoors after 5:00 p.m. until the first hard frost .” The lockdowns are being marketed as “voluntary” — until, of course, you get into the fine print. Continuing: “ The lockdowns are considered recommendations , and there will be no enforcement if residents do not comply, the town spokesperson said. “We want to educate our residents about EEE and the seriousness of the illness and make them aware of the risk,” the statement continued. “However, if they want to use town fields outside these recommendations, they will have to show proof of insurance and sign an indemnification form .”” So, “voluntary” apparently means that if you want to use public lands, you need to sign a waiver and provide proof of insurance to the Public Health™ overseers — which really stretches the term to its limit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-25-government-report-fluoride-intake-lowered-iq-children.html,Government report links fluoride intake to lowered IQ in children,"The United States government has once again found that consuming fluoride is really dangerous, especially for children. A new report from the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reveals that exposure to fluoridated water at levels twice the recommended limit of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of water is linked to lower IQ. Keep in mind that prior to 2015, the government-recommended fluoride level for drinking water was 1.5 mg/l. For many decades – and still in some U.S. cities today that have not adjusted their fluoride levels to the new 0.7 mg/l standard – children across the U.S. have been forced to consume and bathe in water that was fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l, which the NTP now admits causes brain damage and lowers IQ in children. The new study, which includes data and analyses from previously published research, marks the first time that a U.S. federal agency has determined ""with moderate confidence"" that fluoride damages children's brains. ""While the report was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoride in drinking water alone, it is a striking acknowledgment of a potential neurological risk from high levels of fluoride,"" The Associated Press (AP) reported. (Related: Harvard University researchers identified a link between fluoride and ADHD and mental disorders some 10 years ago, but fluoridated water keeps on flowing through taps across the U.S.) Drinking, bathing in any amount of fluoride isn't safe The CDC still claims that fluoride consumption at lower levels is safe, helping to re-mineralize teeth and prevent dental caries (cavities). How is a person supposed to regulate this, though, when people are exposed to fluoridated water at unknown levels each and every day? If a person lives in a fluoridated area and consumes food and beverages made with fluoridated water, not to mention brushing one's teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, the amount of fluoride that ends up being ingested has the potential to be very high. Even if fluoride does the things that public health officials continue to claim it does for the benefit of health, the drug needs to be regulated and controlled at specific levels in actual drug products, not laced into the water supply. ""I think this (report) is crucial in our understanding,"" commented Ashley Malin, a researcher at the University of Florida who has been studying the effects of fluoride on pregnant women and their unborn children, calling the study the most rigorous of its kind. For their study, researchers at the NTP reviewed a cohort of studies from Canada, China, Iran, India, Pakistan and Mexico looking at fluoridated drinking water. Based on the results of all these studies, the NTP determined that consuming fluoridated water at levels greater than 1.5 mg/l results in lost IQ points. While the review itself did not determine exactly how many IQ points are lost due to drinking fluoridated water, several of the studies included as part of the review suggested that children not exposed to fluoridated drinking water have an IQ that is anywhere between two and five points higher than their fluoridated counterparts. The World Health Organization (WHO), by the way, still recommends that water supplies be fluoridated at a level of 1.5 mg/l, which is more than double the new recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 2015 that only 0.7 mg/l of fluoride be added to water supplies. Currently, about 0.6 percent of the total U.S. population, around 1.9 million people, are still exposed to drinking water fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l or higher. ""The findings from this report raise the questions about how these people can be protected and what makes the most sense,"" Malin added. More related news coverage can be found at Fluoride.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-25-rfk-jr-suspends-campaign-with-singular-focus.html,RFK Jr. suspends campaign with singular focus: Ending childhood illness epidemic,"Earlier today, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced that he was suspending his campaign and seeking to remove his name from the ballots in key battleground states (his name will remain on the ballots in “red” or “blue” states, allowing him to remain in the running for the Presidency should neither major party candidate receive 270 electoral college votes). The campaign suspension announcement was not particularly surprising, given the reality that Kennedy himself acknowledged during his press conference to make the announcement, i.e., that he had no realistic path to victory in the general election. What was more surprising to some was the fact that Kennedy also announced his support for President Trump’s candidacy. The lifelong Democrat, whose family has unquestionably been the party royalty for well over 60 years, only ran as an independent after being shunned by the party as he initially attempted to primary Biden. (Article republished from WeThePatriotsUSA.Substack.com ) But this really isn’t a surprise to anyone paying attention. Not only was this development revealed as a possibility by Kennedy’s running mate Nicole Shanahan during an interview earlier this week, today’s announcement comes just one week after President Trump held a meeting to discuss health freedom causes , including vaccine mandates, at his Bedminster, NJ golf club (We The Patriots USA President Dawn Jolly was among the participants in that meeting). It is no secret that Kennedy has advocated for these causes for years as the Founder of Children’s Health Defense . Kennedy and President Trump have known each other for years, and while the two disagree on several issues, they agree with each other more than either of them agrees with Kamala Harris. More to the point, President Trump appears to agree with Kennedy on what Kennedy today referred to as the most important issue facing America, more than any “culture war” issue: the explosion of childhood illnesses like autism, ADHD, allergies, diabetes, cancer, and more. Some in the health freedom community are disappointed with this announcement, suggesting that Kennedy is being ill-used because Trump is Mr. Warp Speed, and didn’t do anything in his four years as President to root out the corruption at the CDC, HHS, or FDA. I’m not going to comment on those sentiments, given that the purpose of this article is not to make an endorsement of either (or any) candidate for President. Instead, I’m writing because, hidden within today’s top political headline, is something much more profound than I think most people realize. And that is the epiphany that health freedom is more important to more Americans than ever before, so much so that it can swing a Presidential election. Maybe this is hard to believe, but what’s harder for me to believe is that the Trump-Kennedy alliance (if alliance is the right word here) would be happening at all if Kennedy did not have the ability to play spoiler to President Trump’s White House bid. Kennedy himself referred to himself as a “spoiler” in today’s press conference, reminding the audience that he promised early in his campaign to drop out if he would be nothing more than a spoiler in the general election. Some pundits in the media dispute this, given that the latest polls generally report Kennedy not receiving more than five percent of the vote. But five percent in a swing state, in an election where some have predicted both candidates in a virtual dead heat in terms of electoral votes, is wildly significant. And when you dig into the profiles of likely Kennedy voters, it’s clear that the majority share one thing in common: they are pro-health freedom, anti-health mandates (most would be labeled “anti-vaccine” by the mainstream media, but that’s a ridiculous over-simplification that is also inaccurate in many cases). Perhaps this is a by-product of the covid era. There’s no doubt that the lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine mandates, and testing mandates of the last four years have substantially increased the ranks of health freedom activists. More people than ever, both in the United States and worldwide, question the safety and efficacy of all vaccines. But this is about more than vaccines. As Kennedy notes, the chronic disease epidemic among our children is due to a variety of factors, not the least of which is the use of pesticides and processed seed oils in our food supply. (If you haven’t already, do yourself a favor and watch Tucker Carlson’s recent interview with Calley and Casey Means .) And then there’s our public water supply tainted with fluoride, glyphosate, and more. And then there’s the chem trails. And then there’s the staggering levels of electromagnetic radiation from wireless internet and 5G cell towers. And on and on and on. It would be far more shocking if our children weren’t suffering from more chronic illnesses than ever before. Although we are far from solving any of these problems, today’s announcement is indicative that we’ve taken a critical first step on the road to doing so: admitting we have a problem. Never before has the health of our children, and health freedom in general, been a top issue in a Presidential campaign. If this move ultimately determines the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election, then it will be safe to say that it was the top issue of this election. And that, in my opinion, is the biggest headline today. The ranks of health freedom activists and advocates have grown to such proportions as to determine who becomes the next leader of the most powerful nation on the planet. Think about that. And after you think about, please join us in doing something about it, if you haven’t already. As a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, we’ll leave the political campaigning to others. But that’s fine, because these issues won’t be decided by an election anyway. Ultimately, these issues will be decided in the courts. No matter what Executive Order is issued, no matter what Congressional Act becomes law, it will be challenged in the courts. Yes, the President has sole authority to appoint the Justices of the Supreme Court, and all other federal judges. But it will be up to organizations like We The Patriots USA - along with, hopefully, a handful of brave Attorneys General - to take up the fight to defend or defeat the actions of the Executive and Legislative branches, as the case may be. Of course, given the events of the last four years, we are already overwhelmed with work, and we will have no shortage of plaintiffs, regardless of the outcome of the election. I wish we could say the same about our funding, but this orchestrated economic collapse has resulted in a substantial decline in giving. If you’re able to do so, please consider making a donation today so that we can continue the critical work of saving our country, and our children. Our future depends on it, quite literally. We have no more important asset or investment than our children, and so much of our work at We The Patriots USA is focused squarely on protecting them, including cases filed in defense of religious exemptions to vaccinations for schoolchildren, as well as litigation to save children from medical kidnapping. And we don’t stop with litigation. We have also been working tirelessly to provide valuable health education to the masses, with projects like our award-winning film Shot Dead , and our Fifth Annual Vaccine Safety Awareness Marathon (streaming live September 7-8, 2024 on the We The Patriots USA Rumble Channel ).

Step right up and get your $200 visa gift cards and college scholarships for all kids ages 5 – 11 who get the next scamdemic mRNA nanoparticle jabs that cause heart attacks , strokes, infertility, turbo cancer, deranged thinking, loss of appetite and 3-foot-long vascular clots. That’s exactly what Commie Minnesota Governor Walz , the current VP candidate for the Dems, did during the Covid scamdemic. Should the communists in DC maintain control in November (steal the election again), the other choice will most likely involve heavy fines and prison time (in “re-education camps by FEMA/DHS) for those who do not comply with the next round of “novel” mRNA clot shots for the lab-made-whatever-disease that’s supposedly spreading everywhere like wildfire. White Clot Syndrome: 40 trillion mRNA spike prions clog the entire vascular system, limiting oxygen, blood flow, and nutrients to vital organs, including the liver, lungs and brain Now it’s being revealed that Covid boosters may help generate up to 100 trillion spike proteins in your blood, clogging up the liver, the lungs and the brain. This is modified RNA. Your DNA has been hijacked to produce deadly prions , and you can’t even sue the manufacturers because they have their own “immunity,” and it’s 100% resistant to your lawyers and your limited wallet of funds. Prions are misfolded proteins, like the spike proteins that mRNA instructs human cells to produce, that can cause severe neurodegenerative diseases . They can spread throughout the entire vascular system and end up lodging in the brain, ovaries, liver, pancreas and lungs. The clots from mRNA “vaccines” should be viewed as a radical new form of prion disease, also known as White Clot Syndrome. Because Covid-19 was not a danger to teens, children or babies, the Vaccine Industrial Complex had to conjure up ways to coerce parents into having the deadly, experimental prion injections given to their young. Do you remember any other “medicine” or “vaccination” that the government literally PAID you to take? Major red flags should go up here for every American, whether you believe in vaccination or not. Shocking research reveals 90% of the U.S. population suffers from vaccine-induced spike prion clogging of the vascular system, a combination of CKM and WCS syndromes New data reveals nearly every person who got an mRNA jab or two (or three) is now suffering from some level of heart strain from the trillions of prions ModRNA creates in the bloodstream, also known as White Clot Syndrome. Medical doctors are befuddled. They all got the wool pulled over their eyes with this Covid jab frenzy, just like Democrats who thought Biden wasn’t senile. Who knew? Independent truth media advocates and natural health advocates knew, that’s who. Less than one year ago, the American Heart Association published a report about the frightening skyrocketing numbers of people suffering from cardiovascular disease, that overlaps type 2 diabetes, obesity and kidney disease. The AMA called the overlap CKM syndrome (cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome). CKM and WCS (White Clot Syndrome) are now a combination serial killer, with the worst damage occurring in blood vessels, the heart muscle and the cardiovascular system. That is why Covid-vaxxed athletes, military members and pilots are dropping dead or having massive heart attacks out of the blue. Medical doctors are realizing this too, but cannot point the finger at the mRNA WCS jabs or they will lose their medical license instantly, and forever. Beware of the next round of mRNA death jabs, most likely under a new plandemic name, like Bird Flu or Monkey Pox.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-23-britons-seek-govt-payments-covid-vaccine-injuries.html,"Nearly 14,000 Britons seek government payments for COVID-19 vaccine injuries","Nearly 14,000 Britons have applied for government payouts due to the harm caused by Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections, according to the Daily Expose . The United Kingdom's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS), first established in 1979, is managed by the British Department for Health and Social Care . The VDPS offers a one-time payment of £120,000 ($157,080) to individuals who are severely disabled as a result of vaccination against certain diseases, including COVID-19. The scheme has processed around 16,000 applications since its establishment. But is worth noting that as per recent figures obtained by the Telegraph , almost 14,000 of these are related to the COVID-19 vaccines. The surge in claims has led to a significant increase in administrative support, with VDPS staff numbers rising from four to 80 last year. Despite the increase, only 175 payments have been approved – amounting to less than two percent of all applications. Payments have been granted for severe conditions such as stroke, heart attack, dangerous blood clots, spinal cord inflammation, excessive limb swelling, and facial paralysis. (Related: Report: VACCINES and LOCKDOWNS are responsible for excess all-cause mortality, not COVID-19 infection .) The Telegraph also reported that thousands of claims have been rejected by medical assessors due to insufficient proof of vaccine-related harm or because the severity of the disability did not meet the 60 percent threshold required for payment. According to a government spokesperson, this aligns with the Department for Work and Pensions ' standards for severe disability. Moreover, 5,500 claims were outright rejected, while 519 were dismissed before a medical assessment. Of the nearly 350 claims where harm was acknowledged but deemed not severely disabling, applicants must demonstrate at least 60 percent disability to qualify. However, of nearly 1,000 requests for reconsideration, only 12 have resulted in reversed decisions. AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine responsible for most of the VACCINE DAMAGE According to the Expose , AstraZeneca's adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine accounts for approximately 97 percent of the approved claims. One such case involved Leona Sanders, the wife of British race jockey Seb Sanders. Leona had developed transverse myelitis – a known adverse reaction to the AstraZeneca vaccine – after her second injection, with her condition worsening after the third. Despite ongoing recommendations for the AstraZeneca vaccine in the U.K., many countries, including Germany, Italy, and France, had halted its use by March 2021. In response to reported cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), AstraZeneca began withdrawing its vaccine in May 2021, citing the availability of newer vaccines better suited to targeting COVID-19 variants. Critics have argued that the VDPS payment is insufficient to cover the legal costs or compensate for the profound impacts on individuals' lives. In turn, Downing Street has maintained that the VDPS is not a compensation scheme but a support mechanism for those seeking further damages through legal channels. The issues with VDPS reflect a significant concern amid the 365,000 serious adverse events reported through the Yellow Card scheme, which include deaths. The Yellow Card Scheme is the British equivalent of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States. But just like its American counterpart, the cases being reported to the Yellow Card Scheme are believed to be just a fraction of the actual vaccine injuries caused by the COVID-19 injections.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-23-2-astronauts-stranded-on-international-space-station.html,Two astronauts still STRANDED on International Space Station due to mechanical failures with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently dealing with a tough and tricky situation involving astronauts Sunita ""Suni"" Williams, 58, and Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore, 61, who are stuck on the International Space Station (ISS). Their return to Earth has been delayed due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Originally launched on June 5 for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission, their return timeline is now uncertain. NASA might extend their stay until February 2025 and is also considering using private space corporation SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft for a possible rescue to bring them back. The prolonged mission has raised concerns about their health – leading to regular eye and hearing exams to monitor their condition. During an Aug. 7 NASA briefing, officials highlighted the ongoing problems with the thrusters on the Boeing Starliner , a crewed and partially reusable spacecraft used by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. The thrusters are critical for controlling the Starliner, and there have been leaks in the propulsion system and some thrusters have unexpectedly lost power. Despite numerous tests on Earth, engineers are still puzzled by the root cause of these issues. Oddly, the thrusters appear to be functioning correctly now that the spacecraft is in space – further complicating the situation. Given the uncertainty surrounding the propulsion system, a return trip for Williams and Wilmore aboard the Starliner seems increasingly unlikely soon. One of the options under consideration is to send the Starliner back to Earth on its own, without the astronauts onboard. (Related: Astronauts stranded at International Space Station told they might not return until February thanks to fault Boeing Starliner .) What happens when astronauts end up stuck in space? Williams and Wilmore are not the first astronauts to face an extended stay in space, British astronaut Meganne Christian, who is on standby for a space mission with the United Kingdom's space agency, has shared what life might be like for Williams and Wilmore. Christian explains that while part of astronaut training is preparing for the possibility that their missions might be extended, space represents its own set of challenges. The astronauts may have to go for some time without showers, drink recycled urine and endure the effects of space radiation during their extended stays aboard the ISS. Although Christian has not yet traveled to space , she has spent time in extremely isolated conditions on a research station in Antarctica called ""White Mars."" Located about 400 miles from the nearest town – further away than the ISS, which orbits 248 miles above Earth – her experience gives her insight into the tough conditions faced by those living on the ISS. Currently, nine astronauts are making do with just two bathrooms and six sleeping quarters aboard the ISS. Managing food and water supplies from Earth is crucial and every resource is carefully monitored. On the ISS, every bit of liquid is recycled. Urine, along with moisture from sweat and breath, is collected and treated through the Water Recovery System. Christian explains that recycling is essential. They joke that ""yesterday's coffee is today's coffee."" To handle waste in microgravity, the ISS uses a special vacuum toilet. Tim Peake, the first British astronaut to live on the ISS, describes the setup. ""For urine, we use a hose with a conical attachment. For solid waste, there’s a small seat over a container with a rubber bag attached."" Food on the ISS is more appealing than recycled coffee. Christian notes that while meals are dehydrated to save space, they are still regular food. Water is added back in before consumption. Maintaining cleanliness in space presents its difficulties. Christian notes that showers aren’t available, so astronauts use wet towels with soap instead. Due to limited clothing options, they change clothes only once a week. Astronauts on the ISS are exposed to higher levels of space radiation compared to people on Earth despite protective shields. Christian said that the amount of time astronauts can stay in space is limited by the radiation they receive. Astronauts stuck in space could be there until 2025, according to NASA.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-23-study-finds-benefits-baked-potatoes-for-diabetics.html,Study finds surprising benefits of eating baked potatoes for diabetics,"New research indicates that the humble potato might serve as an unexpected ally for adults with Type 2 diabetes when prepared correctly . Although often labeled as a dietary villain, baked potatoes could provide significant health benefits, including improvements in heart health and potential support for weight loss and blood sugar control. Potatoes, particularly their skins, are rich in nutrients that promote health, yet they frequently receive undue criticism from those focused on dieting. This change in perspective stems from a study by Dr. Neda Akhavan, an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition Sciences. Akhavan's research presented to the Alliance for Potato Research and Education, challenges long-standing beliefs about potatoes and their role in a healthy diet. The study suggests that these starchy tubers may be more beneficial than previously thought for people who need some assistance with managing diabetes. (Related: Potatoes GOOD for diabetics? Study finds prebiotics from potatoes reduce insulin resistance .) In a university release, Akhavan expressed her interest in doing research on food items ""that are highly stigmatized in the nutrition world."" She noted that potatoes are typically associated with unhealthy preparations, such as deep frying, and are often perceived as high in fat. However, her study aimed to highlight how properly prepared potatoes can be both functional and nutritious. Funded by the Alliance for Potato Research and Education, the study involved 24 participants with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. It is believed to be the first of its kind to scientifically measure the cardiovascular benefits of potatoes for people with diabetes. Each participant was given a daily serving of baked potato with the skin on, weighing 100 grams and containing approximately 20 grams of carbohydrates – just enough for a small snack or side dish. A control group received a similar portion of white rice with the same calorie and carbohydrate content. The study spanned 12 weeks to sufficiently observe changes in blood sugar control and cardiovascular health. Participants were allowed to add herbs of their choice, spices or up to half a tablespoon of butter to their potatoes, but frying in oil was not permitted. Consumption of properly prepared potatoes beneficial for Type 2 diabetics The study revealed a modest reduction in fasting blood glucose levels among participants who consumed potatoes. Additionally, these participants showed improvements in body composition, reduced waist conference and a lower resting heart rate. Akhavan concluded that the study's results provide evidence that white potatoes can be part of the diet of individuals with Type 2 diabetes and used as a substitute for foods with a high glycemic load, such as long-grain white rice. She noted that no adverse effects on health outcomes were observed and some cardiometabolic benefits aligned with the study's expectations. ""Potatoes are a very versatile food and can be eaten with most types of cuisines, but you want to make sure to incorporate them into a well-rounded diet,"" said Akhavan. ""For those tight on time, consider making a large batch of baked or roasted potatoes and meal prep to last you a while. I'm not against boiling potatoes, but you want to keep as much of the potassium from the skin as you can, and you lose some of that when you boil them.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-23-statins-are-pharma-trash-research-mounts.html,"Statins are pharma trash, research mounts","On a long enough timeline, most medical scams — even the most persistent ones — have a way of unraveling. (Article republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) “There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.” -George W. Bush Every major pharmaceutical firm in the West — Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Merck, et al. — has its own proprietary statin drug, which together represent billions of dollars in sales annually in the U.S. alone. Via Data Bridge Market Research (emphasis added): “ Between 2015-2018, approximately 11.4% of U.S. adults had high total cholesterol . There was no significant difference in high total cholesterol prevalence between men (10.5%) and women (12.1%). The highest prevalence was among adults aged 40–59 (15.7%), compared to 7.5% among those aged 20–39 and 11.4% among those aged 60 and over. Adults aged 60 and over also had a higher prevalence of high total cholesterol than those aged 20–39. There were no significant differences in high total cholesterol prevalence among adults based on race or Hispanic origin. The U.S. statin market size was valued at USD 4.53 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 5.10 billion by 2031 , with a CAGR of 1.5% during the forecast period of 2024 to 2031.” The flimsy, lazy cholesterol-causes-heart-disease lie is predicated on flawed and manipulated studies going back decades that purportedly demonstrate a correlation between high cholesterol and heart disease, which is simply taken as causation on faith, even though in other cases — conveniently, ones where the industry’s interests align with dismissing correlation as causation — they are adamant that the two are not one and the same. Via Business Insider (emphasis added): “Speaking to science journal Nature, vaccine expert Kathryn Edwards , professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, said that health authorities must strike a ""delicate balance"" when information is disseminated about the side effects of COVID vaccines . Edwards added that, at times, it might be hard to even prove if the adverse reactions were due to the vaccine, particularly if the reported symptoms strike the patient days after the jab was administered . Nature also cited a study that detailed how challenging it was to link any adverse events through vaccines — as this has to be done through specific lab tests. This is because correlation is not causation — and work has to be done by scientists to determine what caused the reaction, before comparing it with the probability that this symptom occurred purely by chance .” Does correlation equal causation according to The Science™? The answer depends on which side of the equation the biggest dollar sign sits. Via Midwestern Doctor (emphasis added): “ In the 1960s and 1970s, a debate emerged over what caused heart disease . On one side, John Yudkin effectively argued that the sugar being added to our food by the processed food industry was the chief culprit . On the other side, Ancel Keys (who attacked Yudkin's work) argued that it was due to saturated fat and cholesterol . Ancel Keys won, Yudkin's work was largely dismissed, and Keys became nutritional dogma . A large part of Key’s victory was based on his study of seven countries (Italy, Greece, Former Yugoslavia, Netherlands, Finland, America, and Japan), which showed that as saturated fat consumption increased, heart disease increased in a linear fashion.

""We didn't want a mandate,"" Trump told the vaccine booing crowd – watch the clip below . ""The mandate you can't, you just can't do that.""

Trump denies knowing about Project 2025 What many Americans have trouble with is the fact that Trump played a pivotal role in the fast-tracked creation and unleashing of deadly COVID injections under Operation Warp Speed. Legislation was passed to protect Big Pharma from lawsuits over jab injuries and deaths, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was allowed to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) for the experimental drugs through lies and manipulation. At the time, Trump and his people were telling the world that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were helpful remedies for COVID. At the same time, though, Trump kept hawking the then-upcoming vaccines that he repeatedly boasted that ""his"" vaccines were created at hyper-speed with his help. COVID jabs turned out to be wildly unpopular among Trump voters, so now Trump is saying that he will try to make things right for military veterans by giving them back what was taken from them during the ""pandemic."" ""Now he needs to apologize for pushing them at all on anyone,"" one person wrote on X about Trump. ""Let's go one step further and force hospitals to do the same,"" another person added about how everyone who punished others for not getting jabbed should be made to make things right. In response to criticism from Tim Walz about his alleged Project 2025 plan for the nation, Trump told Fox & Friends in a recent interview that Walz is a ""lightweight"" who ""shouldn't be even having any access to possibly being president."" ""The guy, he's been a terrible governor. They've had nothing but problems in their state. He has no capability. They call him coach. He's a semi-coach. You coach some football for a little while. This guy is a lightweight and he shouldn't have access."" Trump continued in the interview to claim that he ""has no idea"" what Project 25 [sic] even is, and that his opposition is simply making it all up to try to make him look bad. ""They know I have nothing to do with it,"" Trump said. ""I had no idea what it was. A group of people got together, they drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some cases perhaps they went over the line. Perhaps they didn't. I have no idea what Project 25 [sic] is but they use it and they know it."" As for the restitution that Trump spoke about for persecuted, unvaccinated military vets, someone on X added that airline pilots who were fired for refusing the shots deserve the exact same restitution under a Trump presidency.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-study-covid-vaccines-heart-inflammation-failure-children.html,Oxford study reveals COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as the sole cause of heart inflammation and heart failure in children,"Researchers at the University of Oxford have uncovered one of the most significant data points with the COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are the sole cause of myocarditis, pericarditis and heart failure among children and adolescents. This revelation challenges the narrative pushed by the Food and Drug Administration , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and mainstream media, which have downplayed or outright denied the risks associated with these vaccines. Children should have never been injected with these instruments of medical fraud, and some suffered heart inflammation and death as a result. (Related: Science behind the CDC's childhood vaccines lacks double blind, placebo-controlled studies and conceals adverse events .) Myocarditis, pericarditis and heart failure occurred only in the vaccinated adolescents The extensive study, which analyzed official government data from over one million children and adolescents aged five to 15 in England, found that myocarditis and pericarditis were exclusively linked to COVID-19 vaccinations. No cases of heart inflammation were recorded among unvaccinated children or those infected with COVID-19. This finding contradicts previous claims linking these serious health issues to COVID-19 infection, sugar intake, video games, or even climate change. Health officials tried to scare parents into vaccinating , claiming their kids would contract COVID-19 and have heart problems from the virus. It turns out that the opposite is true. According to the Oxford study, all reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis occurred in children who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis cases were documented exclusively in the vaccinated groups, with a rate of 27 cases per million after the first dose and 10 cases per million after the second dose. “All myocarditis and pericarditis events during the study period occurred in vaccinated individuals,” the study authors wrote. Over half of the adolescents affected by myocarditis were hospitalized for their serious vaccine injury. Nearly 60% of children in the first vaccination group never received a second dose, so obviously there were widespread concerns about continuing with the harmful vaccine protocol. How many more children would have been injured had parents or doctors not stepped in and stopped the protocol? The COVID-19 vaccines were completely unnecessary for adolescents The study also highlighted that hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 were exceedingly rare in the study group, and there were no recorded deaths from the virus. In fact, both the unvaccinated and vaccinated children tested positive for the virus at similar rates, so there’s no solid data proving that the vaccine prevented anything. This data point also contradicts the fear-based narratives put out by governments and mainstream media authorities. The vaccine was unnecessary from the start and provided no known benefits for adolescents – only heart damage. Dr. John Campbell, a well-known commentator on medical issues, has condemned the results as “deeply troubling,” stressing that this revelation could have catastrophic implications for public health. ""This could not be a more serious report,"" Campbell warned, urging immediate action to address the public health crisis revealed by the study. He describes how the vaccine causes stroke in the following video . To make matters worse, a recent study by Harvard Medical School has linked COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to a sharp increase in sudden deaths worldwide , including fatal cerebral ischemia. The Harvard researchers specifically implicated Moderna's vaccine in the recent spike in this deadly brain disorder, which shuts off blood flow to the brain. This serious health issue is more prominent in studies that investigate health outcomes up to a year after vaccination. The study is also limited, because the control group is centered around unvaccinated populations that were subject to COVID-19 tests, an instrument of medical fraud that was used to forcibly admit children to hospitals and subject them to further deleterious protocol. The study doesn’t look at the large pool of adolescents who didn’t take the tests, who got mildly ill and easily recovered at home.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-sermon-013-why-having-pure-blood-important.html,Sermon 013: Mike Adams discusses why having PURE BLOOD is important,"The Health Ranger Mike Adams discussed the importance of having ""pure blood"" on his 13th sermon, part of his 100-sermon series on the ""Health Ranger Report."" He based this sermon on a verse in the book of Leviticus , which states that ""for the life of the flesh is in the blood"" (Leviticus 17:11). According to him, this verse is an eye-opener about body fluids, including the blood. Adams noted that the mRNA injections currently promoted by the medical system pollute the blood. ""The purity of the blood speaks to the purity of your life and the purity of your flesh. If your blood is contaminated, then your life is contaminated. This is in essence what God is saying. I your blood is clean, you've got a basis to go on and focus on moral purity and spiritual purity – because God talks about these different levels of purity and different levels of the dedication to Him,"" he explained. ""God reminds us, the purity of your blood speaks to the purity of your life. So, if you want to be someone of pure blood then do not take man's Satanic injections of toxins and adjuvants which are neuroinflammatory substances that are deliberately put into the vaccines in order to increase their toxicity. Do not take those substances into your body."" The Health Ranger continued that mRNA is contradictory to the teachings of God in Leviticus and other books of the Bible. This is because the mRNA hijacks the human body's natural cells and causes the cells to produce non-human proteins. These proteins, according to Adams, are not aligned with the genetic code given to humans who are created in the image of God. He added that the ribosomes of human cells are hijacked by pharmaceutical companies and doctors who are injecting people with a satanic self-assembling molecular toxin system, which causes the body to make biological weapons that they can shed on other people. (Related: COVID-19 vaccine sheds graphene-like substance that causes cellular damage and blood clots in the unvaccinated, warns doctor .) Adams: Pure bloods are the future of humanity The founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com exhorted his viewers: ""Do not allow your body to be penetrated and violated by these toxic, demonic substances pushed by Big Pharma and mankind's so-called science."" Adams noted the use of the term ""pure bloods"" in modern pop culture. Given the context of his sermon, he explained that pure bloods are people who did not take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections. These pure bloods, he continued, represent the future of humanity. In contrast, those who took the experimental poisoned mRNA injections now have contaminated blood. They are also suffering from various problems such as very high rates of infertility, spontaneous abortions and sudden death. While some of these problems are deemed as ""long COVID,"" these are actually long-term vaccine injuries. The Health Ranger noted that blood poisons or toxins, such as the ones found in the COVID-19 mRNA injections, impair a person's physical capabilities and neurological function. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to focus on higher values, activities and achievement that brings a person closer to God. Ultimately, he stressed that toxins separate a person from God while healthful nutrition and clean health habits allow an individual to be closer to God. A person should make choices that deliberately enhance the purity and cleanliness of their blood and body.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-kamala-harris-campaign-requiring-covid-19-vaccinations.html,Kamala Harris campaign requires all staffers to have “up-to-date” COVID-19 vaccinations,"The official campaign organization of Vice President Kamala Harris is requiring all aspiring campaign staffers to have ""up-to-date"" Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations despite all the reported dangers associated with the vaccine. The mandate stated on the official website of the Harris for President Campaign , along with the lists of job postings, specifies that vaccination is a condition of employment as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with accommodations available only where legally required. (Related: Kamala Harris issues vaccine mandate for campaign workers – can Americans expect government-enforced jab mandates if she becomes president? ) ""Harris for President requires all employees to be ""up to date"" on COVID-19 vaccination status as prescribed by the CDC as a condition of employment unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. If you seek a reasonable accommodation in relation to the campaign's COVID-19 policy, you should speak to the HR Department prior to reporting to an office location,"" the job listing reads. The CDC advises that individuals receive the 2023–2024 updated COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Novavax to protect against severe illness. However, the policy has raised alarms over the potential risks associated with the vaccines as reports revealed that there are over 1.6 million COVID-19 vaccine-related injuries and deaths in the United States alone. Moreover, European Union regulators previously warned the public that frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response of the body and may not be feasible. The largest COVID-19 vaccine study to date has also revealed a ""higher than expected"" occurrence of neurological and heart issues following vaccination. All this has raised questions about the safety and necessity of requiring ""up-to-date"" COVID-19 vaccinations for all aspiring members of Harris' presidential campaign. Biden-Harris administration already lifted federal COVID-19 vaccine requirements in May 2023 Aside from the dangers, the administration of President Joe Biden and Harris also lifted federal COVID-19 vaccine requirements back in May 2023 due to a significant decline in reported deaths and hospitalizations. ""Today, we are announcing that the Administration will end the COVID-19 vaccine requirements for Federal employees, Federal contractors, and international air travelers at the end of the day on May 11, the same day that the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. ""Additionally, HHS and DHS announced today that they will start the process to end their vaccination requirements for Head Start educators, CMS-certified healthcare facilities, and certain noncitizens at the land border. In the coming days, further details related to ending these requirements will be provided,"" the White House official website posted in May 2023. In other words, the continued warning of the CDC against the ""serious"" infection of COVID-19 contrasts with the description of on-the-ground doctors as ""exceedingly mild."" ""It isn't the same typical symptoms that we were seeing before. It's a lot of congestion, sometimes sneezing, usually a mild sore throat,"" Erick Eiting, vice chair of operations for emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York City said about his urgent care patients... ""Just about everyone who I've seen has had really mild symptoms. The only way that we knew that it was COVID was because we happened to be testing them.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-gen-z-blames-social-media-mental-struggles.html,"Gen Z blames social media for mental health struggles, yet few are ready to disconnect","A recent survey reveals that three out of four Gen Z individuals with internet access in the United States believe social media negatively impacts their mental health . The survey, which gathered responses from 2,000 Gen Z social media users, found that Instagram and TikTok (both at 20 percent) and Facebook (13 percent) were the platforms most often linked to declines in mental well-being . For older members of Generation Z, born between 1998 and 2004, growing up with nearly a decade of social media exposure may have contributed to what one expert referred to as "" problematic internet use ."" (Related: How smartphone addiction affects brain function and mental health .) Commissioned by LG Electronics, this survey was carried out online by Talker Research between June 20 and June 24. The study shows that people start to feel negative emotions just 38 minutes after using social media. This is often because they encounter upsetting content (51 percent), feel unproductive with their time (49 percent) or experience ""fear of missing out,"" or FOMO (36 percent). On average, individuals spend about five and a half hours each day on social media and 45 percent believe they use it more than their friends do. Louis Giagrande, LG Electronics head of U.S. marketing, pointed out that spending a lot of time online can leave people feeling drained. He said people should be mindful of the content they engage with to improve their overall well-being and focus on positive content to help manage life's challenges better and find more happiness. Interestingly, 62 percent of Gen Zers wish they could reset their social media feeds. Many are frustrated with the content they see, with 53 percent saying it doesn't match their interests and 54 percent feeling they have little control over what appears in their feeds. Only 16 percent believe they have full control. Despite these issues, 80 percent of respondents also find that social media can positively impact their mood. Content that tends to lift people's spirits includes comedy (65 percent), animals (48 percent), beauty-related posts (40 percent) and prank videos (34 percent). Conversely, content related to violence (50 percent), politics (40 percent) and sexual themes (32 percent) often leads to negative feelings. The study found that two-thirds of people have managed to turn a bad day into a good one thanks to social media. They are also 70 percent more likely to use social media when they're in a good mood and 44 percent believe it has a positive effect on their outlook on life. Looking ahead , 38 percent think social media platforms will improve their impact on mental health over the next five years. Gen Zers use social media daily for various reasons, according to the study. Sixty-six percent do it out of boredom, 59 percent seek laughs or smiles, 55 percent need a distraction or break, 49 percent want to stay updated on global events, 44 percent check in on friends, 42 percent seek connections with others, 33 percent look for relaxation and 32 percent search for specific information. How smartphone addiction affects mental health Recent findings reveal a concerning link between excessive smartphone use and serious mental health issues. Teens who spend more than three hours daily on social media face an increased risk of developing mental health issues, especially those related to internal stress and anxiety. Research from JAMA Psychiatry , which studied nearly 6,600 U.S. adolescents, suggests that boosting media literacy, limiting social media time and redesigning social media platforms could help alleviate these mental health issues. A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal consolidates evidence from numerous research efforts – showing that heavy smartphone and social media use is associated with greater mental distress, self-harm and suicidal thoughts among young people. This effect is particularly pronounced in girls and follows a pattern where more screen time correlates with more severe problems. Experts also point out that social media negatively influences teenagers' self-esteem and their relationship with others. Problems, such as cyberbullying, social comparison and the glorification of self-harm and suicide are prevalent. Furthermore, heavy smartphone use and multitasking contribute to chronic sleep issues – impacting academic performance, cognitive abilities and emotional stability. San Diego-based psychologist Dr. Jean Twenge and her colleagues have documented a significant rise in anxiety, depression and loneliness among American adolescents. Her latest research shows that high school seniors now spend about an hour less each day engaging in face-to-face social activities compared to their peers from the 19080s. This decrease in personal interaction – such as attending social events, dating and spending time with family – correlates with increased feelings of loneliness, especially since smartphones have become widespread.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-monkeypox-scam-covid-vaccine-shingles-side-effects.html,German doctor says monkeypox is a SCAM – it’s just COVID “vaccine”-induced shingles under a different name,"In a recent interview with Austrian broadcaster AUF1 , Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, based out of Germany, revealed that one of the known side effects of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" is a rashy, blistery, severe pain-filled condition that looks a whole lot like monkeypox , which the media is now calling ""mpox."" The main symptoms of monkeypox include blistery rashes that are extremely painful, which is also characteristic of both herpes zoster and shingles. Shingles, by the way, causes a person to develop blisters on the skin that resemble chickenpox. (Related: We warned our readers about this back in 2022 when monkeypox first emerged in U.S. headlines, revealing that shingles, autoimmune blisters, and herpes are all hallmarks of COVID jab poisoning.) Attorney Aaron Siri made public some 390,000 reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System showing that shingles is a common side effect of COVID ""vaccination."" Roughly one out of every 450 people who gets jabbed for COVID will develop shingles. Dr. Wodarg reiterated all of this and more during his interview, which is unlikely to make the rounds in the United States or really anywhere in the West. In fact, a quick search for a transcript or clip of his interview on Google and Bing pulls up page after page of ""fact checks"" claiming that monkeypox has nothing to do with COVID injections. Alex Jones, however, shared it on his X page – and you can also watch it below: German Doctor Exposes Monkey Pox Scam: Says It's a COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect. From the German article titled: Doctor: Monkeypox is actually shingles, a side effect of the COVID vaccines The main symptom of monkeypox is the rash that can look like blisters and is accompanied… pic.twitter.com/yWum7TsO0N — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) August 20, 2024 PCR tests for monkeypox are bogus, just like the ones for COVID Like some kind of Pandemic 2.0 repeat , the stage is quickly being set to make monkeypox the next COVID, complete with lockdowns and PCR testing, which Dr. Wodang says are bogus just like they were the first time around. PCR tests are nothing more than expensive ruses produced by the pharmaceutical industry – Dr. Wodang specifically mentioned Roche as one of their producers. The new narrative is that these PCR tests are necessary to detect the presence of monkeypox inside people's bodies. This continued assault on the public's intelligence is wearing down people's understanding of diseases. There is one side that no longer even believes these so-called diseases are real outside of vaccine side effects while the other is so deathly afraid of the next ""virus"" that they are obeying whatever they are told by the media and government. As for monkeypox, one can only imagine the number of ""fully vaccinated"" individuals who will eat up whatever gets dispensed concerning the disease and do whatever they are told. This includes taking PCR ""tests"" that whitewash the truth that monkeypox is a side effect of COVID ""vaccination."" Dr. Wodang calls it a ""perverse industry,"" referring to Big Pharma, that would pull these kinds of deceptions on the masses, scaring people into complying all for industry profit and eugenics purposes. Another thing to consider about the rise of adult shingles throughout society is that this is likely a result of modern generations getting ""vaccinated"" for chickenpox. It used to be that chickenpox, like measles, was a common thing that people ""caught"" and recovered from naturally, providing them with lasting immunity – but that changed after chickenpox ""vaccines"" were introduced. ""I started seeing an increase in young people with shingles with this generation that was vaccinated for chickenpox,"" wrote someone on X claiming to have been a nurse for 20 years.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-hhs-ai-robots-inoculate-hpv-vaccine-misinformation.html,HHS deploys AI robots to “inoculate” social media users against HPV vaccine “misinformation”,"Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) have developed an artificial intelligence-powered weapon for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that will allow the government to police the internet for ""misinformation"" about HPV (human papillomavirus), Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and other ""vaccines"" on social media. The team says its AI policing robot can be ""swiftly and efficiently"" adapted to address the spread of content online that negatively impacts Big Pharma's vaccine sales pipeline. Using United States taxpayer dollars, UPenn researchers say they now have the technology at the ready to ""inoculate"" social media users against ""misinformation"" about childhood vaccines. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, Children's Health Defense (CHD) was able to procure grant documents showing that HHS is spending $4 million on an ""Inoculate for HPV Vaccine"" randomized controlled trial that began in April 2022 and will run through March 2027. The National Cancer Institute is also contributing cash to the project. Headed by Melanie L. Kornides, an associate professor of nursing at UPenn, the AI robot development program aims to increase vaccine uptake across the U.S. population. It is also focused on developing ""strategies to combat misinformation"" in general. Kornides and her cohort of digital health communication experts, software and program designers, social media analysts, and machine learning experts will run their social media ""inoculation"" experiment on the parents of 2,500 children between the ages of eight and 12. Data is being collected from platforms like YouTube, Twitter (now X), Facebook, and Instagram. (Related: Did you know that HPV vaccines like Gardasil are triggering severe injuries and deaths in children ?) Using natural language processing to train AI in the weapon of censorship Since most online talk about vaccines seems to take place on the above social media platforms, Kornides and her colleagues are using natural language processing to train their AI robot in how to identify ""HPV misinformation,"" also known as posts and comments that are critical or questioning of HPV vaccines. Regardless of whether the information is true or false, Kornides and her team aim to remove all of it that could cause parents to not vaccinate their children. Study subjects will be exposed to three separate study arms with different types of messaging in order to deploy the ""inoculation tool"" to test whether or not it makes them ""immune"" to ""misinformation."" ""A control group will get no particular messaging and two test groups will be exposed either to messaging designed to inoculate viewers against content critical of of HPV vaccines and content critical of anti-vaccine arguments,"" CHD reports. ""The subjects will get 'booster' doses of messaging at three and six months after their first inoculation ... If successful, the researchers wrote, this novel approach to combating health 'misinformation' can be used in 'wide-scale social media campaigns' addressing pandemics, childhood vaccination and other health issues."" The researchers claim that their new AI robot is necessary because ""misinformation"" about HPV vaccines is one of the leading drivers behind so-called ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which they claim often comes from ""anti-vaccine organizations."" According to Mary Holland, co-author of ""The HPV Vaccine on Trial: Seeking Justice for a Generation Betrayed,"" what these UPenn researchers are trying to do is ""a sign of weakness"" within the public health industry. ""When you are censoring information, labeling it misinformation and smearing us, this is a sign that they've lost the science and are now in a verbal food fight,"" Holland is quoted as saying. ""It's just a sign they are going to lose."" More related news about the AI takeover of the internet and Big Pharma's involvement in the heist can be found at Robots.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-common-pesticides-cannot-be-washed-off-your-fruit.html,Common pesticides CANNOT be washed off your fruit – these chemicals penetrate through the skin and into the pulp,"As the public becomes more aware of the negative health effects of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, more people are washing their produce before they eat it. However, while this practice may remove some bacteria it ultimately may prove to be useless for removing chemicals because common pesticides are absorbed through the skin of the fruit and into the pulp. In a new study published in Nano Letters , researchers have developed a novel cellulose-based membrane that can detect the presence of pesticide chemicals on fruits, vegetables and herbs. The new food safety detection system can also determine whether the chemicals have penetrated past the skin and into the pulp. The innovative material, known as nano-wrinkled cellulose/silver nano-particle membranes (NWCM-Ag), is highly sensitive and can precisely identify trace levels of harmful substances in food. New food safety detection method allows researchers to find pesticide residues in fruit pulp Traditional detection methods, such as gas and liquid chromatography, are often cumbersome and expensive. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has emerged as a promising alternative due to its high sensitivity, but its effectiveness has been limited by the inherently weak signals in Raman spectroscopy. The new study addresses these limitations by integrating cellulose dissolution, aligned regeneration and in situ nano-particle synthesis to create a flexible, transparent and highly sensitive membrane. The NWCM-Ag membranes utilize a three-dimensional nano-wrinkled structure, which enhances the electromagnetic coupling of metal nanoparticles on the membrane surface. This design allows for the detection of pesticides at concentrations as low as 10^-9 M. The researchers focused on two pesticides in this study: thiram and carbendazim. Both are widely used fungicides used on food crops. The primary focus of the study was on apples, where testing revealed that thiram and CBZ could penetrate from the peel into the pulp layer. According to the authors of the study, ""fruit-cleaning operations cannot wholly remove pesticides."" The situation of pesticide contamination has worsened over time. Water, soil and food crops are constantly infiltrated by these carcinogens and ravaged by poor agricultural practices. The most recent pesticide data report by the USDA found detectable pesticide residues in 72% of 10,000 food samples. While the USDA contends that 99% of the foods tested do not “pose risk to consumers’ health and are safe,” the ubiquitous nature of pesticides could present health risks with cumulative exposure. A separate analysis found pesticide residues in 59 different fruit and vegetable categories. Of these categories, 20% contained pesticides residues at levels posing “significant risks. ” Apples must be completely peeled to remove the pesticides One of the key innovations of the NWCM-Ag membrane is its ability to visualize the distribution of pesticides within food . Using Raman imaging technology, researchers demonstrated that pesticides can penetrate through the apple peel into the pulp layer, approximately 30 micrometers deep. This finding suggests that washing fruits is insufficient for removing pesticide residues. The peel of the fruit, one of the most nutrient-dense parts of the fruit, may have to be removed altogether in order to remove the pesticide residues. The NWCM-Ag membranes not only excel in sensitivity but also in versatility. They have been successfully tested on a variety of food items, including vegetables, fruits, seafood and condiments. The membranes offer high optical transparency (91%) and flexibility, making them suitable for diverse applications and detection scenarios. The membranes demonstrated versatility by successfully detecting contaminants in a variety of foods, including: chili powder, cucumber, rice grains and shrimp. ""The development of these nano-wrinkled cellulose membranes represents a significant leap forward in food safety technology,"" said Dr. Zewan Lin, the lead researcher of the study. ""By enhancing the spatial and electromagnetic coupling effects, our membrane offers unparalleled detection capabilities that can be crucial for ensuring food safety."" The study's findings pave the way for more effective and accessible food safety measures, particularly in regions with limited resources. The ability to detect pesticide residues at ultra-low concentrations could transform food safety practices, reducing the risk of pesticide ingestion, enhancing consumer protection against carcinogens , and beckoning the need for agricultural transformation.

Modern ""science"" ebbs and flows based on feelings and emotions For someone who has long claimed to be rooted in sound science, Tyson has adopted a feelings- and emotions-based approach to the transgender question. In his mind, science has no answers for determining gender – it is all based on how a person feels from day to day. ""Neil deGrasse Tyson leans to the mental and emotional aspect of sexuality while ignoring the physical,"" warns Alexander Glumac (@SmokedGeezer) on X. ""It's not how you feel! It's what you are!"" Even though he is a physicist rather than a biologist, Tyson feels as though he is qualified to make this determination because of the framed pieces of graduation paper that line his walls. ""In his defense, he is the dumbest physicist on the planet,"" wrote ""Tiger Cat"" (@BackTo_1970) about Tyson on X. ""Sure, DNA doesn't matter. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and decide I'm 7 foot tall,"" joked another. ""Or maybe I'll decide to be Asian. It's seriously pathetic that people who really know better play this game."" Tyson's brand of ""science"" tells people that whatever they feel is true, even if someone else's ""truth"" differs dramatically. It is an anything-goes brand of postmodern subjective ""truth"" that is really in vogue right now as the establishment tries to normalize LGBT perversion. ""This is not based in science but a religion, an ideology,"" another on X wrote about the transgender tripe that Tyson is peddling to his followers. ""What is wrong with you? Instead of pandering to people and spreading false information you should've stayed quiet."" Journalist Sharyl Attkisson chimed in as well to tell Tyson that he is flat-out wrong with his so-called ""scientific"" assessment of the trans question. ""XX and XY determine male and female, however if society (or some in it) wish to create new definitions and ideas, they are free to do so,"" she tweeted. ""Others are free not to adopt them. It's no better to force tyranny on a majority than to force tyranny on a minority."" It is a wonder how Tyson ever came to be the pop ""scientist"" that he now is. At Modernity , someone suggested that he is a diversity hire who is simply unqualified for the job. ""He had never done any significant individual work in physics other than a catalog any grad student could have done if he had chosen to do it,"" this person wrote, citing a source described as ""a real PhD astrophysicist at a world prominent lab.""

Now that’s a scary movie, and it’s a good thing it’s not really happening here on Earth for real. Or is it? Korean scientists just discovered through in-depth laboratory research that Moderna and Pfizer mRNA Covid “vaccine” vials contain millions of magnetic graphene nanoparticles that can self-assemble into white fibrous clots that grow up to three feet long and move, like snakes. MIT researchers discover how atomically thin layers of carbon can be controlled electronically through quantum computing, a.k.a. “superconducting” In case you are doubting that “nanoparticles” can be controlled electronically, MIT colleagues have already proven it true with three different electronic devices that use multiple “fabrication steps” to do it by superconducting electricity without resistance through an “unconventional mechanism.” The results are published in the May issue of Nature Nanotechnology . In their words, a certain “magic-angled graphene is the most versatile of all superconducting materials.” The special angle of graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons. This type of nanoparticle research began way back in 2004 and can now be used to conduct both HEAT and ELECTRICITY. That takes us back to the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine “technology” and all the strange fibrous clots embalmers across the globe are finding in the Covid-vaccinated masses who die from “unexplained” causes, including sudden heart failure, strokes and spontaneous miscarriage. Korean scientists found that mRNA vaccine vials belonging to Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech contain these self-assembling nanoparticles. Coincidence? We think not. Just follow the bouncing technological nanoparticle ball. The clots are the amyloids forming chains. Can you say spike protein patent without coughing into your Fauci face diaper? Remote-controlled magnetic nanoparticles can manipulate the brain, reducing appetite and exacerbating emotional states No invasive surgery needed to manipulate the human brain. Thanks to advances in nanoparticle technology (a.k.a. mRNA), hardware is now being used in laboratories to control the minds of lab animals. Using long-range and large volume switches that manipulate magnetic fields, researchers at South Korea’s Institute for Basic Science (IBS) are in early stages of Nano-MIND ( Magnetogenetic Interface for NeuroDynamics ) technology that allows them to control the appetite and emotions of mice remotely. They are saying this can help treat neurological disorders, so can it damage the CNS also, if it gets into the wrong hands? Of course it can. The tests included inducing maternal instincts in female subjects and reducing appetite in others (where the mice lost 10% body weight). If you’re not impressed yet, realize now that the scientists manipulated a complex network of over 100 BILLION NEURONS by simply magnetically pushing and pulling nanoparticles that were implanted in the mice’s brains. This means scientists already know how to use nanoparticles to control animal cognition, emotion and social behavior. Let that sink in for a minute when thinking about the crazy things happening to the Covid-jabbed sheeple everywhere. Was the entire plandemic vaccine apocalypse the beginning of the biggest mind control experiment ever conducted on planet earth? Will mRNA-vaxxed humans only eat bugs because they’re simply not very hungry suddenly? Will a few billion folks who got the Covid gene therapy injections suddenly lose their minds, say, when Trump wins in November, and attack each other like zombies? Or will the 5-G towers across earth instruct all the mRNA-injected spike prions to suddenly GATHER together and clot, causing a mass die-off of humans, just like Bill Gates predicted and planned at the TED conference 20 years ago? Tune your internet dial to NaturalMedicine.news for natural remedies that may be able to undo the horrible damage from fibrous nanoparticle clots caused by mRNA so-called “vaccines.” "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-plastic-surgeons-society-condemns-transgender-surgeries-minors.html,American Society of Plastic Surgeons condemns transgender surgeries for minors,"The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) has condemned surgeries for gender-confused minors , breaking from the establishment position made by activist groups. According to a recent report, the ASPS will not be supporting the transgender surgical mutilation of minors. The trade group said in an interview with City Journal's Leor Sapir that it ""has not endorsed any organization's practice recommendations for the treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria ."" ""ASPS acknowledged that there is 'considerable uncertainty as to the long-term efficacy for the use of chest and genital surgical interventions' and that 'the existing evidence base is viewed as low quality/low certainty,'"" Sapir said. ASPS has over 11,000 members and represents over 90 percent of plastic surgeons in the U.S. and Canada. The group's statement is the latest by a major medical organization refusing to abide by the mainstream transgender agenda, which has received critical attention for its false and ideological standards on gender and biological sex. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), frequently mentioned as an authority on surgical and chemical interventions despite being an LGBT pressure group, has claimed that ""transitions"" were ""medically necessary"" so insurance companies would pay for them. The administration of President Joe Biden also pushed the activist group to exclude age minimums for permanent surgeries. (Related: Biden health official pressured transgender health organization to remove age limit for trans surgeries .) These procedures can leave individuals permanently infertile while also causing several health problems, including impaired bone density, lack of ability to breastfeed and other serious reproductive damage. Puberty blockers are not really reversible, WPATH doctor admits A WPATH doctor admitted in 2022 that puberty blockers are not really reversible . ""There's challenges with puberty suppression that we have to acknowledge and that's why it's 'reversible asterisks,'"" Dr. Scott Leibowitz said. ""One cannot be on puberty suppression endlessly. You get to a place where physiologically we need hormones."" As reported by the Washington Free Beacon the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also allowed a small group of activists to write their transgender ethics. ""Though the organization's guidelines are framed as the consensus position of the AAP's members, only a handful of physicians had a role in shaping them,"" Aaron Sibarium wrote in 2022. ""Instead, insiders say, the AAP is deferring to small, like-minded teams of specialists ensconced in children's hospitals, research centers, and public health bureaucracies, rather than seeking the insights of pediatricians who see a wide cross-section of America's children."" Moreover, a review by the United Kingdom's National Health Service determined that claiming interventions support individuals with gender dysphoria is baseless. Several of them will outgrow their confusion as time goes by. Some American medical experts have also warned about the damages of transgender drugs and surgeries.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-authorities-mystery-passenger-aboard-tragic-brazilian-flight.html,Authorities: MYSTERY PASSENGER was aboard plane that crashed in Brazil on Aug. 9 with multiple cancer doctors,"A mystery passenger was aboard the aircraft that crashed in Brazil on Aug. 9, according to authorities in the South American nation. The Daily Mail disclosed the identity of the mystery passenger aboard the ill-fated Voepass ATR-72 turboprop plane as Constantino The Maia. According to the regional carrier, his name did not appear on the list of boarded passengers due to a ""technical error."" However, the Mail noted that it is unclear whether Maia was simply missed off the manifest or he snuck on board at the last minute. The Voepass flight took off from Cascavel Regional Airport in Brazil's Parana state and was bound for Sao Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo state. But instead of landing at the airport, it crashed into the backyard of a condominium building in Sao Paulo's Vinhedo town. Fifty-eight passengers, including Maia, alongside four crew members, perished in the crash. Brazil's Federal Police also began its own investigation, saying in a statement that it had dispatched specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims. Authorities also commenced transferring the corpses to the morgue, and called on victims' family members to bring any medical, X-ray and dental exams to help identify the bodies. Blood tests were also done to help identification efforts. ""As we see a possible body in the middle of the destruction of the plane, rescue teams come in. Then they take pictures, gather as much evidence from the victim as they can so the identification can be the most accurate,"" said firefighter Maycon Cristo. ""We will investigate so this case is fully explained to the Brazilian people."" For now, the cause of the crash remains unknown. Guilherme Derrite, public security secretary for Sao Paulo state, told reporters that the plane's black box had been recovered – apparently in a preserved state. 8 Oncologists among the casualties of ill-fated flight But even more mysterious than Maia's presence on the flight is the fact that eight oncologists were among the casualties of the ill-fated Voepass flight. Eduardo Baptistella, an official from the Regional Medical Council, confirmed the deaths of the doctors. ""These doctors were going to an oncology conference,"" he said. ""These were people who dedicated their lives to serving others."" (Related: Eight of the 68 people who died in Brazilian plane crash were cancer doctors on their way to SBTMO 2024. ) According to Baptistella, a total of 15 doctors were supposed to be traveling to the conference aboard the ill-fated flight. However, seven of them had taken an earlier service. Other reports have also disclosed that the eight doctors were convinced that they had discovered a cure for the turbo-cancers caused by the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections. The oncologists were reportedly furious with Big Pharma and determined to help the billions deceived into taking the lethal gene therapies. Clinical trials for this cure were in an advanced stage at the time of the oncology conference. But following the deaths of the eight doctors, these trials have been halted. Surviving researchers have sadly acknowledged that crucial knowledge was lost with their colleagues' untimely demise. Head over to Conspiracy.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-children-given-mrna-covid-vaccines-immune-alterations.html,Children given mRNA COVID-19 vaccines showed dangerous immune system alterations one year later,"A new study shows that children between the ages of five and 11 who were given two doses of Pfizer's Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines had raised levels of antibodies that indicate an altered immune system response a year after getting the jab. The study , which was published in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal and conducted by German researchers, examined blood samples taken from 14 healthy children on the day they received their first dose of the vaccine, as well as at the one-month mark and one year after getting their second dose. At that point, the levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibodies in their blood were elevated, which suggests that their immune system actually changed its response mechanism. Although previous studies have seen this same phenomenon in adults, the new study is believed to be the first to demonstrate that it also occurs in children. In their report, the researchers cautioned: “IgG4 responses should gain more attention in health and disease, especially in the context of mRNA vaccination. Understanding the unusual mechanism triggering IgG4 production is crucial as more mRNA vaccines are currently under development and could hit the global market soon.” Children's Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Brian Hooker said that the study’s conclusion is worrying given the connection between raised IgG4 levels and IgG4-related disease, which is a “multi-organ, fibro-inflammatory condition that usually involves the pancreas, kidneys or salivary glands but could involve any other organ.” He notes that as much as 80% of people who have the disease have high levels of these antibodies, and although it can be treated, it is associated with chronic underlying autoimmune conditions that often need lifelong treatment. Another concerning aspect of this finding is the fact that the human body's ability to fight off cancer can be compromised when the immune system has elevated IgG4 antibodies. In addition, a 2022 study revealed that people who have IgG4-related diseased may have a higher risk of several types of cancer, particularly lymphoma and pancreatic cancer, when compared to the general population. The potential for increased levels of these antibodies due to COVID-19 vaccines to harm the immune system has long been a concern among researchers. Risk of myocarditis is 620% higher after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, study shows Another way that COVID-19 vaccines are damaging children's health is by causing heart problems such as myocarditis and pericarditis. This has been flagged since the vaccines were first rolled out and increases in these conditions were observed following vaccination. (Related: Heart failure surge among children linked to COVID-19 vaccines .) Recently, a peer-reviewed study of more than nine million South Koreans found a remarkable 620% increase in the risk of myocarditis and a 175% rise in the risk of pericarditis after receiving the vaccine. Their findings came after following 4.5 million individuals for an average of 15 months after getting the jab. Meanwhile, a study carried out in Thailand during the country’s adolescent COVID-19 vaccine campaign found a “stunning” association between the Pfizer shot and myocarditis . The study, which involved more than 300 teens aged 13 to 18, found that 18% had abnormal electrocardiograms following their second dose, with 3.5% of males developing myocarditis or myopericarditis and one being admitted to the ICU for related heart problems. Unfortunately, this could be just the beginning of the studies showing the dangerous long-term effects of the shots as many problems will only become apparent with time. These studies are a reminder of precisely why so many people feared getting experimental vaccines , especially for children who are at a delicate time in their development. "

Manufactured by South Korean industrial conglomerate Hyosung, the ATM looks like most others, but the couple identified components of it that they say point to the coming implementation of vaccinations as a prerequisite for accessing banking services. ""Okay, so here we have the new ATMs here at the UVA Credit Union here in Charlottesville, Va.,"" the man says in the video below while introducing viewers to the ATM. ""Looks like they're made by Hyosung with a thing that kind of looks like – like the buildings there in Wuhan, China. This looks like a bar to possibly scan your license plate or your vehicle. Down here we have ID scan for, I assume – for vaccination cards..."" As the man is explaining that he believes the ID scanner and palm scanner are ""for possible microchips"" to be associated with vaccination cards, the woman is heard in the background emphasizing that she and the man are ""trying to warn everybody."" ??

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-stock-price-monkeypox-vaccine-maker-rises-declaration.html,Stock price of monkeypox vaccine maker INCREASES after WHO emergency declaration,"The World Health Organization 's (WHO) emergency declaration with regard to monkeypox is good news for Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic , the company making the vaccine against the disease. Stock prices for Bavarian Nordic jumped by 17 percent following the WHO's declaration of a global public health emergency, according to Forbes . The 17 percent climb came after an earlier 12 percent rise in stock prices. U.S. shares for Bavarian Nordic, meanwhile, climbed by 33 percent. Paul Chaplin, Bavarian Nordic's CEO, told Bloomberg News that the company can provide 10 million doses of its vaccine to African countries over the next 18 months. ""We have inventory and we have the capabilities. What we're missing are the orders,"" he said. On Aug. 14, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) – the second time he did so after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). He justified the declaration by citing a reported 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since the start of 2023, alongside a new monkeypox strain being detected in Sweden. (Related: WHO warns that new monkeypox strain is a global emergency .) ""The emergence of a new clade of [monkeypox], its rapid spread in eastern DRC and the reporting of cases in several neighboring countries are very worrying,"" said Tedros. ""On top of outbreaks of other [monkeypox] clades in [the] DRC and other countries in Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives."" Tedros' announcement followed an earlier declaration by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) that monkeypox is a continent-wide public health emergency. In line with the declaration, the DRC – where the monkeypox outbreak is concentrated and most severe – has approved two vaccines: Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos and the LC16 vaccine from Japan. Monkeypox is another ploy to boost Big Pharma profits According to a post by the Africa CDC, 10 million monkeypox vaccine doses are needed to control the outbreak. It also called for global support for its vaccination efforts. While monkeypox has appeared to be a mild illness in the U.S., several lucrative government contracts in 2022 paid Bavarian Nordic and other vaccine makers hundreds of millions to stockpile the injections. That year, a monkeypox outbreak was recorded in 116 countries. It affected almost 100,000 people – primarily gay and bisexual men – and killed about 200. On Aug. 8, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) – under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – renewed its contract with Bavarian Nordic. The agency committed $156.8 million to manufacture and store Jynneos doses to partly replenish the inventory used to manufacture vaccines following the 2022 outbreak. But some experts have expressed doubt over the PHEIC declaration, warning that it was a ploy to increase Big Pharma profits under the guise of addressing the monkeypox outbreak. ""The WHO is using the monkeypox outbreak in Africa to fast-track, under emergency use, two monkeypox vaccines,"" said Dr. Kat Lindley, president of the Global Health Project. ""We need to use discernment and evaluate risks and benefits before recommending any experimental new product to a vulnerable population."" Dr. Meryl Nass also expressed similar skepticism on her Substack page, noting that there are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about monkeypox. ""If this generally mild viral illness is killing people, what is the cause of death? Does it only cause death in severely immune-suppressed patients? Are babies dying due to dehydration? Do we need to treat babies with fluids rather than give them a vaccine that was never tested in babies?"" Visit MonkeypoxPanic.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-21-democrats-approve-extreme-pro-abortion-agenda.html,Democrats approve party platform committed to extreme pro-abortion agenda,"Democrats voted Monday night to finalize their official 2024 party platform , which is full of references making clear the party intends to continue its aggressive advocacy of effectively unlimited abortion-on-demand. (Article by Calvin Freiburger republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) The platform, drafted before President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from reelection and given final approval without updating it to reflect that Biden has been replaced as presumptive nominee by Vice President Kamala Harris, spans 90 pages, casting a favorable light on the Biden-Harris administration’s record and laying out extensive plans on a range of issues for a second term. Its “Reproductive Freedom” section (starting on page 48) begins by condemning the U.S. Supreme Court’s “extreme” 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade . As a result, it says, “more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide.” Overturning Roe “has also had devastating consequences for families who have suffered the heartbreak of infertility,” it adds, by opening the door to state bans on in vitro fertilization (IVF), without acknowledging that Republicans from state legislatures all the way to presidential nominee Donald Trump rushed to protect IVF – to the consternation of pro-lifers who have grave concerns about the practice’s mass destruction of embryonic human beings. By contrast, the platform touts Democrats “fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state,” with a recap of the administration’s “whole-of-government” campaign to preserve abortion-on-demand through executive orders, health regulations, legal advisories, and more. In particular, it highlights “defending access to emergency medical care, including clarifying that federal law on emergency care preempts state abortion bans, educating patients on their rights, making it easier for patients who have been denied emergency care to file a complaint, and ensuring hospitals meet their legal obligations to offer care.” That passage refers to the administration’s lawsuit arguing that the federal Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires emergency room doctors to commit abortions that would otherwise be illegal under state law. Republicans argued that the White House misread and misapplied EMTALA in numerous ways, including that the law does not require procedures that violate state law, does not mandate services a particular hospital does not offer, and in fact requires hospitals to provide care for preborn children. The platform then declares that if Trump returns to office, he “will ban abortion nationwide. And his allies plan to ban medication abortion nationwide, without Congress or the courts, by enforcing a law from the 1800s, including prosecuting women and doctors for sending or receiving medication abortion in the mail.” In fact, Trump has consistently said over the past several months he wants all future abortion battles left to individual states, going so far as to eliminate the Republican Party platform’s longstanding support for banning abortion nationwide, although he has sent mixed signals on what he would do about Biden’s abortion pill rules. “With a Democratic Congress, we will pass national legislation to make Roe the law of the land again,” the section concludes. “We will strengthen access to contraception so every woman who needs it is able to get and afford it. We will protect a woman’s right to access IVF. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment. And in his second term, President Biden will continue to support access to FDA-approved medication abortion, appoint leaders at the FDA who respect science, and appoint judges who uphold fundamental freedoms.” The platform underscores the choice facing pro-life voters in November between a GOP that has diminished pro-life enthusiasm with its work to dilute the pro-life cause and a Democrat Party as radical as ever on the issue, which is expected to leave most pro-lifers resigned to accept Trump as preferable to the alternative. National polling aggregations by RealClearPolitics and RaceToTheWH currently indicate that Harris continues to lead Trump in both national polling and Electoral College projections since replacing Biden.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-uk-vaccine-damage-payment-scheme-requires-60percent-disabled.html,The UK’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme requires individuals to be “60% disabled” to receive compensation for their vaccine injury,"Individuals who are injured by COVID-19 vaccines deserve to be adequately compensated for medical costs, the loss of life and livelihood and for pain and suffering. Families who lost loved ones to the vaccine should be able to make wrongful death claims. However, during the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, governments around the world contracted with the vaccine companies, absolving them of liability when their products cause harm to individuals. This means that the governments and vaccine companies knew there would be vaccine injuries, but these entities conspired to keep this known fact a secret. The vaccine makers and government bodies falsely advertised the vaccines as “safe and effective” while denying individuals proper informed consent, in an elaborate process of coercion and deceit. For EU member states , the AstraZeneca vaccine was purchased in bulk in August 2020, only if the countries indemnified the manufacturer for liabilities. “In order to compensate for such high risks taken by manufacturers, the Advanced Purchase Agreements provide for Member States to indemnify the manufacturer for liabilities incurred under certain conditions..."" UK’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme only compensating 2% of claims Even with these crooked contracts in place, thousands of vaccine-injured individuals have pursued claims with longstanding vaccine injury compensation systems set up by their governments. These systems were setup decades ago to compensate vaccine injuries caused by traditional vaccines. These government-ran systems, while not holding the vaccine makers directly accountable, still allow some cases of vaccine injury to be recognized and compensated. However, these government-ran systems deny the vast majority of claims. The United Kingdom’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) is refusing to compensate 98% of vaccine injury claims because the vaccine injured individuals are “not disabled enough.” This system was setup in 1979 to compensate injuries from traditional vaccines. According to a Freedom of Information request, nearly 14,000 individuals in Britain have applied for compensation through the VDPS for disabilities caused by COVID-19 vaccines. In the UK, individuals were coerced to take the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca. Individuals were locked down, discriminated against and segregated from society until they complied with the vaccine mandates and vaccine passports implemented in the UK. Out of the nearly 14,000 individuals who initially applied for compensation, only 175, or 2 percent, have received compensation. To make matters worse, this one-time compensation payment oftentimes fails to cover basic medical expenses, let alone pay for the pain and suffering inflicted on individuals. The meager payment of £120,000 ($155,300) does not consider the loss of livelihood nor does it adequately cover long term damages to one’s health, career and livelihood. Moreover, the one-time payment is uniform and doesn’t factor in the individual’s unique medical needs. An individual who now suffers from blood clots or had a heart attack after taking the vaccine should have access to a larger compensation pool that addresses the serious harms and high financial costs inflicted by the vaccine. UK government mocks the disabled who were injured by vaccines According to the FOIA request, individuals seeking compensation have suffered from stroke, heart attack, blood clots, inflammation of the spinal cord, excess swelling and facial paralysis. Instead of adequately compensating these individuals, the UK government has denied 98 percent of the claims. According to the report, hundreds of individuals were turned down because they were “not disabled enough.” According to the VDPS, an applicant has to be at least 60 percent disabled to qualify. The VDPS is essentially setup to mock victims of vaccine injury, refusing to pay disabled individuals. This callous disregard for human life and dignity comes from a UK government that pushed the AstraZeneca vaccine onto its population, despite the vaccine being halted by Germany, Italy, France and many other European countries as early as March 2021. It should be noted that, of the compensation requests, 97 percent of the injuries were caused by the Astra-Zeneca vaccine that was mandated by the government. By May 2021, AstraZeneca conceded that their vaccine product does cause blood clots and they withdrew their product worldwide. However, because the vaccine makers are not held directly accountable, they are allowed to create booster vaccines for future coronavirus variants, while claiming that their new formulas are safer and more effective. Under this cursed system, the lies and suffering will only continue, as vaccine makers continue to injure the public with impunity, and as governments refuse to adequately compensate victims of vaccine injury .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-study-mrna-vaccines-increase-risk-spontaneous-abortions.html,NO CHOICE AND NO LIFE: Study finds mRNA COVID-19 vaccines increase risk of spontaneous abortions,"A recent study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology has revealed unsettling safety data on COVID-19 vaccines when administered during pregnancy. The findings, derived from a comprehensive analysis of over 105,000 pregnancies, paint a grim picture, with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines (biological weapons) being associated with an increased rate of spontaneous abortion . When it comes to COVID-19 vaccines mandates, the Democrats and their government institutions essentially mandated abortions, taking away CHOICE and LIFE. Study finds startling rate of spontaneous abortion in pregnant women injected with COVID-19 jabs The study utilized data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and nine health systems across the United States, representing 3% of the population. It analyzed pregnancies from December 15, 2020, to June 28, 2021, focusing on the rates of spontaneous abortion among women who had received one or more doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during early pregnancy. The researchers applied a validated pregnancy algorithm using diagnostic codes, electronic health records, and medical claims data to assign gestational ages and identify cases of spontaneous abortions and ongoing pregnancies. The analysis was stratified by vaccine type, gestational age, and maternal age groups. The study identified an astonishing 13,160 cases of spontaneous abortions out of 105,446 unique pregnancies analyzed. Among women aged 35 to 49, the rate of spontaneous abortions was notably higher at 38.7% compared to the 22.3% rate observed in ongoing pregnancies. Among women with spontaneous abortions, 8.6% had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose within 28 days prior to the abortion. The study's authors concluded that the risk of spontaneous abortion after COVID-19 vaccines was not statistically significant. Dr. Heather Lipkind, who served on Pfizer’s independent external data monitoring committee, and Drs. Naleway and Vesco, who received funding from Pfizer for unrelated studies, share serious conflicts of interest with one of the makers of the mRNA vaccines. These connections to Pfizer raise concerns about the objectivity of the study’s findings and the potential influence of external factors on the research outcomes. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recklessly harming pregnant women Conventional medical wisdom cautions against introducing illicit drugs, toxins, heavy metals, certain herbs, pharmaceuticals, and unknown substances during pregnancy. Fetal development is a delicate process, dependent on specific nutrients and hormonal processes. Disturbingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. These experimental vaccines instruct the woman’s cells to produce foreign proteins that do not readily absolve and can travel throughout the blood to various organ systems. How do these pervasive toxins affect a developing baby? The ACOG doesn’t seem to care, because it’s all about compliance with a narrative, with no objective approach to science or appeal to traditional common sense. The revelation of a higher rate of spontaneous abortions among women who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during early pregnancy warrants a cautious and thorough review. The ACOG has an ethical duty to warn pregnant women of this risk when they are offered this deleterious product in the future. Without proper informed consent about vaccine risks, pregnant women are routinely coerced to take products that may cause abortions, despite the woman choosing LIFE. With almost every government institution and every Democrat in the country mandating individuals to take these shots, these false authorities have proven themselves to be against personal choice and opposed to life, while mandating destruction and death on pregnant women who CHOOSE LIFE and condoning statistics that link their savior vaccines to the TERMINATION of LIFE.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-experts-slam-cdc-report-vaccines-saved-lives.html,Experts slam LAUGHABLE CDC report claiming vaccines saved 1.1M lives,"Experts have criticized a ""laughable"" report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claiming vaccines have saved 1.1 million lives. The Aug. 8 edition of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) reproduced a methodology from a 2014 paper published in the journal Pediatrics . The said paper by Dr. Fangjun Zhou, a scientist at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and his colleagues estimated the health and economic benefits of vaccination for the year 2009. According to the MMWR, routine childhood vaccines – like those targeting measles, tetanus, diphtheria and hepatitis B, among others – have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations and 1.1 million deaths over approximately 30 years. It also estimated that the injections have also saved the country $540 billion in direct costs and $2.7 trillion in indirect societal costs, such as parents missing work to care for a sick child. Zhou defended the study, saying that it ""shows the substantial impact of vaccines on peoples' lives and the impressive return on the investment in vaccines and immunization services. Even mainstream media praised the report as a ""testament to the success"" of childhood vaccines and as evidence that the high cost of childhood vaccines is paying off. But experts who talked to the Defender begged to differ from the MMWR's findings. According to them, the CDC relied on outdated disease and mortality statistics that led to ""laughable"" conclusions. Moreover, the public health agency ignored the real costs of adverse effects of vaccination in its report. ""The methods are shoddy, the data are untethered for reality and the conclusions are a preposterous fiction,"" said Toby Rogers, a fellow at the Brownstone Institute. ""This study is an advertisement on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry and it should be treated as such."" Other experts also chime in ""If there are two or more conflicted journals to represent the benefits of the childhood vaccination program, you could not find them,"" said author and Minnesota congressional candidate Mark Blaxill. ""The profession of pediatrics is the delivery channel for the childhood immunization program, that's why it exists. And the MMWR is put out by the CDC, which is recommending the program. So this is propaganda, and it is put out by those parties most interested in defending the outcome."" According to the report, the highest number of deaths prevented was 752,800 from diphtheria. The next largest benefit claimed was over 100 million measles cases prevented, 13.2 million hospitalizations avoided and 85,000 deaths prevented. But Rogers was skeptical of these claims, telling the Defender : ""None of the vaccines available through the Vaccines for Children Program are as effective as the CDC claims. ""We know that the mumps portion of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella vaccine] does not work. The pertussis portion of DTP [diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine] does not stop infection nor transmission of pertussis."" Meanwhile, Children's Health Defense Chief Science Officer Brian Hooker noted that the diphtheria mortality rates used for the report were ""highly inflated."" ""[These numbers were] prior to the development of antibiotics,"" Hooker stressed. "" Corynebacterium diphtheriae , the bacteria that causes diphtheria, is treatable with penicillin or erythromycin."" Blaxill also commented on the report's findings about diphtheria. According to him, diphtheria was ""a disease of the horse-drawn economy,"" adding that C. diphtheriae ifs often found in horse manure. ""It's caused by environmental exposures and it's not infectious and it isn't common, really anywhere, anymore,"" he said. ""In other words, a century of economic progress was excluded.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-doctors-drug-dealers-arrested-matthew-perry-death.html,"Doctors, drug dealers ARRESTED in connection with actor Matthew Perry’s ketamine overdose death","Several suspects were arrested on Thursday, Aug. 15, in Southern California in connection with the drug overdose death of actor Matthew Perry last year. On Oct. 28, 2023, the 54-year-old Perry, most known for his role in the television sitcom ""Friends,"" was found dead in the heated end of a pool at his Pacific Palisades home in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office ascribed his death to the acute effects of ketamine, a legal drug commonly used as an anesthetic and for treating depression. (Related: Ketamine seen as ""fast-acting"" for those who suffer from depression .) Following Perry's death, law enforcement immediately opened an investigation. Los Angeles ABC affiliate KABC verified through police sources that five arrests were made in connection to the investigation during an early morning operation on Thursday in Southern California. Police said they ""executed search warrants and seized computers, phones and other electronic equipment"" to discover who provided Perry with the illegally prescribed ketamine that brought about his death. The doctors and dealers who were arrested allegedly helped arrange and deliver the ketamine to Perry. Five people were arrested, including two physicians, Salvador Plasencia, 42, and Mark Chavez, 54. Two drug dealers were also arrested – Jasveen Sangha, 41, also known as the ""Ketamine Queen,"" and Eric Fleming, 54. Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, 59, was also arrested. All five were arrested and indicted over allegations that they were part of a ""broad underground criminal network."" Suspects exploited Perry's addiction problems Prosecutors said the group exploited Perry's addiction problems, with one accusation claiming that the five defendants made tens of thousands of dollars by selling ketamine to the troubled star. In one example, Plasencia allegedly collaborated with Chavez to charge Perry $2,000 for a vial of ketamine that was worth $12, after he became progressively desperate to get his hands on the drug, as stated in the filings. Meanwhile, Perry's assistant has acknowledged being the one who supervised the actor's ketamine doses after being trained on how to give them by Plasencia. Court documents claim that Iwamasa injected Perry with 27 shots of ketamine in the five days leading up to his death. Prosecutors allege that Sangha's distribution of the substance on Oct. 4, 2023, led to Perry's death. Photos issued by prosecutors showed that Sangha had thousands of pills and several kilograms of powder in her ""drugs emporium"" home. Police raided her home in March and retrieved the implicating evidence including text messages about selling ""double strength"" ketamine. Sangha, who has dual American and British citizenship, is now indicted with a lot of drug offenses connected to providing the ketamine that killed Perry. An affidavit filed in a Los Angeles federal court by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Tyler Abrego on March 20 depicted a raid the day before on Sangha's home. ""During the search, law enforcement seized significant quantities of illegal drugs, including approximately 1,978 grams of orange pills that field tested positive for methamphetamine, 79 bottles containing a clear liquid that field tested positive for ketamine, and various other suspect narcotics,"" Abrego stated in the criminal complaint. A handgun can also be seen in a photo of the seized drugs incorporated in Abrego's affidavit. The complaint stated Sangha was a ""large volume drug dealer"" earlier identified by the DEA, Los Angeles Police Department homicide detectives and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Agents confiscated her cell phone which had ""conversations related to selling pressed methamphetamine pills and ketamine."" In a March text conversation about selling ketamine, she asked for a payment of ""958,51"" to her PayPal and said, ""I think you'll like these but remember they're double strength."" The DEA agent stated that videos retrieved from Sangha's phone showed her ""cooking ketamine."" Follow Addiction.news for more stories about drug overdose deaths in America.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-harris-issues-vaccine-mandates-campaign-workers-president.html,Kamala Harris issues vaccine mandate for campaign workers – can Americans expect government-enforced jab mandates if she becomes president?,"Kamala Harris is requiring that everyone who works on her presidential campaign receive the COVID-19 vaccine – even though the pandemic peaked long ago and the vaccines have since been proven to be ineffective in preventing spread and potentially quite dangerous – demonstrating yet again that this is much more of a political issue for liberals than something done out of a genuine concern for public health. On the official Harris-Walz presidential campaign website, a list of job opportunities appears on a page entitled “Work for Us.” The page lists several job opportunities and their requirements, with a disclosure at the bottom informing potential candidates of the vaccine mandate . They stop short, however, of explaining why the mandate exists. While many COVID-era vaccine mandate policies claimed they were enacted for the “safety” of employees or clients, it’s getting a lot harder to convince the public there is any benefit in such mandates these days. They write: “Harris for President requires all employees to be ""up to date"" on COVID-19 vaccination status as prescribed by the CDC as a condition of employment, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law,” they write. “If you seek a reasonable accommodation in relation to the campaign's COVID-19 policy, you should speak to the HR Department prior to reporting to an office location,” the listing adds. Just what does the CDC “prescribe” these days? A message on their website says that they recommend the “2023-2024 updated COVID-19 vaccines” from makers such as Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Novavax. Meanwhile, they define “up to date” as getting “1 age-appropriate updated COVID-19 vaccine” for those aged 5 to 64; for those 65 and older, “2 updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine doses” are required. It’s a laughable requirement for a number of reasons, not least of which is the fact that Harris tested positive for COVID-19 in 2022 after receiving the jabs and boosters publicly. There’s also the fact that Harris likes to insist on platforms like X that women should be trusted to “make decisions about their own body, health care, and future” – except, apparently, when it comes to decisions about putting poison into their bodies if they want to be employed. Last year, the Biden administration ended COVID-19 vaccine requirements for all federal employees and contractors, as well as international air travelers, and put an official end to the COVID-19 public health emergency, so why is Harris insisting on her employees getting jabbed? An unhealthy workforce It’s easy to joke that only someone with a questionable mental state would be willing to work for Kamala – even those who somehow can get past her politics would surely be turned off by the numerous reports over the years of her being a nightmare boss – but the truth is that many of her job candidates could well be experiencing mental and physical ailments as a result of the vaccine. The biggest global study so far examining medical issues in nearly 100,000 individuals who got COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher-than-expected rise in both neurological and cardiac problems after getting jabbed. Meanwhile, nearly 13,000 claims have been filed with the U.S. vaccine compensation program related to the pandemic response; more than 10,000 of the claims cite the COVID-19 jabs as causing either injury or death. If Kamala Harris is requiring all those who work on her campaign to get the jab, it isn't much of a stretch to assume that she is likely to also implement vaccine mandates for the American public if she wins the election.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-abim-punishes-doctors-advocating-for-early-covid-treatment.html,American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) punishes doctors advocating for early COVID treatment and debating COVID-19 vaccine safety by revoking board certifications,"The FLCCC Alliance categorically disagrees with the recent decision by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) regarding the revocation of board certifications of FLCCC Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Marik, and FLCCC Alliance President Emeritus Dr. Pierre Kory. We believe this decision represents a dangerous shift away from the foundational principles of medical discourse and scientific debate that have historically been the bedrock of medical education associations. (Article republished from Covid19CriticalCare.com ) Since May 2022, when the ABIM first issued a Notice of Potential Disciplinary Action, Drs. Marik and Kory have tirelessly defended their positions, providing substantial medical and scientific evidence to support their recommendations for early COVID-19 treatment and their critiques of vaccine risks. Despite presenting over 170 references in a detailed 60-page response submitted in January 2023, the ABIM has chosen to dismiss these robust scientific contributions in favor of a narrow, “consensus-driven” narrative. “This fight is about more than just our right to speak—it’s about protecting the future of healthcare. When doctors are silenced for questioning the prevailing narrative, we all lose,” said Dr. Pierre Kory. “We must ensure that medical decisions are guided by expertise and evidence, not by fear of reprisal. Our commitment is to every physician’s freedom to practice medicine based on what they know is right.” “True progress in medicine depends on the free exchange of ideas and the courage to challenge established norms,” said Dr. Paul Marik. “Without open scientific debate, we risk losing the opportunity to discover better treatments, such as proven repurposed drugs for new viruses, and to provide the best patient care and save lives. It’s essential that we continue to discuss and debate all perspectives if we are to uphold the integrity of our profession. This is not just about the certifications of Drs. Marik and Kory—this is a broader fight for the future of healthcare, where physicians can practice medicine based on science and conscience, without undue interference or fear of retribution. The decision by the ABIM is not only an attack on the professional integrity of these doctors but also a direct threat to the freedom of medical practitioners around the world. “The FLCCC Alliance firmly believes that the essence of medical science lies in the open dialog and exchange of ideas and the rigorous debate of differing perspectives,” said President and Chief Medical Officer FLCCC Alliance Dr. Joseph Varon. “However, the actions of the ABIM reflect a troubling trend towards censoring any opinions that challenge the status quo, thereby stifling innovation and harming the doctor-patient relationship.” Collectively, we are evaluating options to challenge these decisions and to ensure that the voices of Drs. Marik and Kory, and indeed all healthcare professionals, are not silenced by those who seek to suppress scientific dialog and debate. The FLCCC Alliance remains steadfast in our mission to uphold the integrity of the medical profession and to advocate for treatments that save lives. Read more at: Covid19CriticalCare.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-cdc-report-vaccines-saved-millions-lives-laughable.html,CDC releases report claiming vaccines have saved 1.1 million lives; experts call it “laughable”,"The many dozens of ""safe and effective"" vaccines that children in the United States typically receive after birth have saved hundreds of millions of them from illness and death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a new report that experts are calling ""laughable."" The CDC's latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) claims that routine childhood vaccinations for things like measles, diphtheria, tetanus, and hepatitis B have prevented more than half a billion cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and precisely 1,129,000 deaths over the past roughly 30 years. The federal public health agency is also claiming responsibility for allegedly saving U.S. taxpayers $540 billion in direct costs, as well as $2.7 trillion in indirect social costs, with its longtime childhood vaccination program. The corporate media is parroting the CDC's claims as a ""testament to the success"" of childhood vaccination in America. Experts like Toby Rogers, PhD, a fellow at the Brownstone Institute for Social and Economic Research, however, say otherwise. ""The methods are shoddy, the data are untethered from reality and the conclusions are a preposterous fiction,"" Roberts told The Defender , a project of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Children's Health Defense (CHD). ""This study is an advertisement on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry and it should be treated as such."" (Related: Remember when the CDC admitted that COVID injections maybe only help prevent one death for every one million people who get jabbed?) CDC paper is bogus propaganda The paper was constructed by Fangjun Zhou, PhD, and other researchers from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease. They looked at data on approximately 117 million children born between 1994 and 2023, reproducing the methodology from a 2014 paper that Zhou and colleagues published on estimated health and economic benefits of vaccination for a single year, 2009. One of the new study's major problems is the fact that it included data for all vaccinated children rather than just participants in the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program, which provides ""free"" vaccines to about half of all American children. They conducted a very simplistic and scientifically shoddy series of calculations that intended to show that getting jabbed is much better for children and society than not getting jabbed. ""If there are two more conflicted journals to represent the benefits of the childhood vaccination program, you could not find them,"" commented Mark Blaxill, co-author of ""The Age of Autism: Mercury, Medicine, and a Man-Made Epidemic,"" about the bogus nature of the paper. ""The profession of pediatrics is the delivery channel for the childhood immunization program, that's why it exists. And the MMWR is put out by the CDC, which is recommending the program. So this is propaganda, and it is put out by those parties most interested in defending the outcome."" Interestingly, the CDC analysis did not include flu shots, Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and RSV monoclonal antibodies, all of which were more recently added to the CDC's childhood injection schedule. ""The mortality rates they used of 15-20% were reported prior to the development of the vaccine in the 1920s,"" said Brian Hooker, PhD, chief scientific officer at CHD, about how the CDC study skewed the mortality rates for diphtheria. ""However, this was prior to the development of antibiotics. Corynebacterium diphtheriae (the bacteria that causes diphtheria) is treatable with penicillin or erythromycin."" Rogers added that none of the vaccines available through the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program are as effective as the CDC claims, which means the data is even more skewed. ""We know that the mumps portion of MMR does not work,"" Rogers said. ""The pertussis portion of DTaP does not stop infection nor transmission of pertussis. That's true for lots of vaccines on the schedule."" The CDC cannot be trusted to ever tell the truth. Learn more at CDC.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-going-vegan-8-weeks-reverse-biological-age.html,New study suggests going vegan for 8 weeks can help turn back your biological clock,"A recent study suggests that following a vegan diet for just eight weeks may help lower an individual's biological age . This is being touted as a way to help lower risks for conditions like dementia and diabetes . The study, featured in BMC Medicine , found that the reduction in biological age was connected to changes in DNA methylation – a process that can influence gene activity without changing the genetic code. The study was a randomized controlled trial involving 21 pairs of adult identical twins. In each pair, one twin maintained an omnivorous diet – eating both animal- and plant-based foods, along with an egg and one and a half servings of dairy. The other twin adhered to a vegan diet based on plants, such as fruits, grains, nuts and vegetables Findings showed that those on a vegan diet had a reduction in their epigenetic aging markers, while those on the omnivorous diet did not. Additionally, the vegan group experienced a decrease in the biological ages of their heart, hormone, liver and inflammatory and metabolic systems. They also lost an average of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) more than the twins on the omnivorous diet, likely due to differences in calorie intake. The researchers emphasized the importance of further investigation to understand the complex interactions between aging, diet and weight management. Veganism, which involves eliminating meat and dairy from one's diet, has become increasingly popular. Since 2008, the number of people identifying themselves as ""vegan"" in the United Kingdom has surged by 350 percent . The reasons for this shift are diverse – ranging from concerns about animal rights and environmental issues to personal and religious motivations. A significant number of individuals adopt a vegan diet in pursuit of better health. Evidence indicates that, when properly planned, a vegan diet can offer various health advantages. For those transitioning from a diet high in animal products, switching to a plant-based diet can bring about notable changes in the body. Initial changes during the first few weeks of a vegan diet One of the most noticeable effects of going vegan is a notable boost in energy levels. This improvement comes from eliminating processed meats, which are common in omnivorous diets, and replacing them with nutrient-rich fruits , nuts and vegetables. These plant-based foods enhance the intake of vitamins, minerals and dietary fibers. Continuing the vegan diet over the next few weeks will see people experience changes to their bowel movements due to the increase in consumption of foods high in fiber associated with the vegan diet Registered dietitian Jennifer Mimkha notes that many individuals are pleasantly surprised by how easily they lose weight after switching to a plant-based diet. Along with the improvement in the consumption of dietary fibers, the weight loss is also attributed to the lower calorie content of many plant-based proteins compared to meat. However, the vegan diet's impact on weight still largely depends on its quality. Consuming "" vegan junk food "" or excessive simple carbohydrates can lead to weight gain, whereas a balanced and nutritious plant-based diet – particularly if replacing a diet high in saturated fats and processed foods – is more likely to support reasonable weight loss. (Related: Researchers link ultra-processed VEGAN food products to heart disease risk and early death .) Changes after three to six months on a vegan diet After three to six months on a vegan diet, individuals may notice that the increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, combined with a reduction in processed foods, can lead to skin improvements and the near-disappearance of skin conditions like acne. By this time, individuals might see a decrease in vitamin D levels , since this essential nutrient is predominantly found in animal products like dairy, fish and meat. To prevent deficiencies, it is important to consume fortified foods or take supplements, upon the advice of physicians or other licensed health practitioners, especially during the winter months when sunlight is less available. A well-planned vegan diet that is low in sodium and processed foods in a few months might show significant benefits for heart health, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and strokes. It must be noted that a vegan diet typically lowers an individual's intake of nutrients , such as calcium, iron and zinc. While the body can become more efficient at absorbing these nutrients from plant sources, adjustments to diets may also help prevent deficiencies for some individuals, although supplements may be needed to meet the nutritional needs of others. Long-term effects of a vegan diet As people reach the six-month to one-year marks on vegan diets, people who have stayed true to these nutrition plans may start to experience a decrease in vitamin B12 levels. This vitamin is crucial for maintaining healthy blood and nerve cells and is primarily found in animal products. A lack of vitamin B12 can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, memory issues and tingling sensations in the extremities. To prevent B12 deficiency, incorporating fortified foods or supplements into your diet is essential. Without adequate B12, the benefits of a vegan diet, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be compromised. Long-term B12 deficiency can also result in serious, irreversible nerve and brain damage. As time progresses, typically over a few years, vegans might observe changes in their bone health. Up until around age 30, the body effectively absorbs and deposits minerals into the bones. After this age, bones start to deplete their stored minerals to maintain calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, it's important to ensure sufficient calcium intake during younger years to support bone health. While vegetables such as kale and broccoli provide calcium, many vegans fall short of their calcium needs, leading to a higher fracture risk compared to omnivores and vegetarians. Plant-based calcium is also less readily absorbed by the body, so supplementation or consuming fortified foods may be necessary to meet nutrition requirements. In the long run, maintaining a balanced vegan diet could help individuals maximize the health benefits associated with it. Although many of the benefits of a vegan diet are well-documented , nutrient deficiencies can undermine these benefits if not managed properly. Fortunately, the growing availability of clean and nutritious vegan food products makes it easier to maintain a nutritious and varied diet. With thoughtful planning, a vegan diet can be a healthful choice. Watch the following video discussing what happens to the body when people go vegan .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-youtube-ceo-susan-wojcicki-dead-vaxx-totalitarian.html,"Former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who just died from lung cancer, remembered by some as “dead vaxx totalitarian”","The recent death of former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has the media in tumult trying to whitewash her legacy . Fawning reports about how ""amazing"" Wojcicki was conveniently ignore her totalitarian ways while at YouTube, especially during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic."" While the general sentiment seems to be that it is unwise to speak ill of the dead, it is important for readers to know who Susan Wojcicki really was: a ""dead vaxx totalitarian,"" to quote Armageddon Prose 's Ben Bartee. ""Susan Wojcicki was among the most hardcore censors of truthful COVID-19 information throughout the pandemic, censoring anything critical of the so-called vaccines and anything speculating that COVID-19 originated from a Chinese lab receiving government funding funneled by Anthony Fauci through EcoHealth Alliance,"" he writes. ""It is for these trespasses against free speech and human welfare that I will remember Susan; others, again, in the corporate state media can (and have) write glowing obituaries about her brave and stunning leadership as a female entrepreneur or whatever."" (Related: Be sure to read our earlier report about how Wojcicki died just a few months after her son mysteriously perished in a dorm room at UC Berkeley.) One year before dying, Wojcicki bragged about ""everything we've achieved"" One media outlet that praised Wojcicki rather than tell the truth about her legacy is U.S. taxpayer-funded NPR . Describing Wojcicki as ""a Silicon Valley visionary,"" NPR praised the woman for overseeing YouTube's ""explosive growth over the past decade."" ""She also oversaw the platform as it grappled with hate speech, misinformation and inappropriate content,"" NPR noted. Last year, Wojcicki announced that she would be stepping down from her CEO role to ""start a new chapter focused on my family, health, and personal projects."" Within a year, Wojcicki was dead. ""I took on each challenge that came my way because it had a mission that benefited so many people's lives around the world: finding information, telling stories and supporting creators, artists, and small businesses,"" Wojcicki bragged at the time. ""I'm so proud of everything we've achieved. It's been exhilarating, meaningful, and all-consuming."" Wojcicki's use of the term ""all-consuming"" to describe her time at YouTube is ominously ironic in light of the fact that her small cell cancer was also all-consuming, eventually taking her life. Wojcicki's legacy includes implementing new policies such as: - Removing all content that contradicts the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice on COVID - Removing all information ""that is problematic,"" including ""anything that is medically unsubstantiated"" - Removing ""anything that goes against WHO recommendations,"" which she classified as content in ""violation of our policy"" It is sobering to think of how many lives were needlessly lost because Wojcicki decided that YouTube users were no longer allowed to recommend natural alternatives like vitamin C and turmeric for overcoming a COVID infection. ""Just how many lives may have been lost directly due to Wojcicki's brutal censorship regime – how many people might have gained access to true information regarding the risks of COVID-19 'vaccines,' for example, via YouTube and reconsidered before getting injected – would be nearly impossible to quantify,"" Bartee writes. ""But it's not beyond the realm of the imagination that such a case occurred at least once in the four years since the pandemic began. Which, to my mind, means Susan has their blood on her hands."" Wojcicki's policy decisions at YouTube also affected how parents treated their children during the ""pandemic;"" how schools locked everything down in extreme fear; and how corporate America treated its workers amid all the virus chaos. ""God might forgive her, and you may as well; I won't,"" Bartee says. ""In my view, she got off too easy, having never faced any consequences here on Earth for her villainy.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-cdc-childhood-vaccines-conceals-adverse-events.html,"Science behind the CDC’s childhood vaccines lacks double blind, placebo-controlled studies and conceals adverse events","A double-blind placebo-controlled trial is a rigorous study design where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the treatment and who is receiving a placebo. This method minimizes biases and provides the most reliable evidence of a vaccine’s safety and efficacy. However, a recent evaluation of vaccine product inserts by the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) indicates that childhood vaccines, as listed on the CDC’s schedule, were not subjected to double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The study designs for almost every vaccine on the childhood schedule was based on fraudulent placebos, allowing regulators to overlook serious levels of adverse events for each new vaccine. To make matters worse, many vaccine trials are based on research periods that are shorter than Operation Warp Speed -- the accelerated time-frame used to fast-track emergency use authorization for the most dangerous vaccine products in U.S. history. Because of these hasty, short term, fraudulently-designed vaccine trials, the real world, long term effectiveness of all childhood vaccines is unknown. There is no evidence that a single life has been saved by this system of rigorous vaccination, but there is a plethora of evidence of children injured, lives lost. CDC's childhood vaccine schedule is based on fraudulent study designs, fake placebos Hepatitis B (HepB) Vaccines: Both Recombivax HB and Engerix-B, commonly injected into newborn infants, did not undergo double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Instead, safety was evaluated through shorter-term studies and observational data. The Recombivax HB and Engerix-B trials had controls with no placebo, and safety reviews were limited to a few days. DTaP Vaccines: Infanrix and Daptacel, which allegedly protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, also lacked double-blind placebo controls. Safety evaluations were performed over periods ranging from 30 days to six months, with no long-term placebo studies. PCV (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines): Prevnar 13 and Vaxneuvance trials used investigational vaccines as controls instead of a true placebo. Reports indicated serious adverse events but were deemed acceptable due to no notable patterns. Vaxneuvance was actually tested against Prevnar 13 in clinical trials, not against a placebo. The results showed similar rates of serious adverse events in both groups. Regulators approved both vaccines because the so-called placebo was statistically just as harmful as the vaccine – a fraudulent study design. Rotavirus Vaccines: The Rotarix vaccine, which attempts to prevent one form of infant diarrhea, was tested against fractions of the vaccine itself. This trial used a placebo consisting of the same vaccine components without the rotavirus antigen, rather than a true placebo. Adverse events were reported but considered within acceptable safety limits. Similarly, RotaTeq trials used a placebo that contained multiple vaccine ingredients rather than a pure placebo. This approach was used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in a controlled setting, a period that varied from 31 days to just a year. Influenza Vaccines: The initial trials for flu vaccines did not always include a placebo control. Today, seasonal flu vaccines are updated annually, and new formulations are NOT subjected to new placebo-controlled trials each year. The antigen selected for seasonal flu vaccines is based on guesswork and may not match the upcoming circulating strain of influenza, especially by the time the strain mutates. After 60 years of pushing flu vaccines , there is no evidence of lower mortality rates. MMR vaccines: The M-M-R-II trials did not use a double-blind placebo-controlled approach. Instead, the trials involved historical controls or other vaccines. Adverse event data were reported, but the studies did not include a pure placebo group. The measles and mumps antigens do not convey long term immunity in populations, a fraud known by manufacturer Merck for over a decade . Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine: The Varivax vaccine was tested using controls that included neomycin or other substances rather than a double-blind placebo. The trials actually recorded higher rates of infections in the vaccinated group compared to controls. This study suggests that other random substances may provide more robust immunity than chickenpox vaccines. Hepatitis A (HepA) Vaccines: The clinical trials for Havrix did not use a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Instead, developers compared the vaccine to other Hepatitis B vaccines or to historical data. Similarly, Vaqta trials included control groups receiving other vaccine ingredients or substances rather than a pure placebo. HPV Vaccines: Gardasil 9 trials involved various control methods, including aluminum adjuvants or other vaccine ingredients. This means that trial participants were unknowingly injured by so-called placebos that were really just aluminum adjuvants. The equivalent number of adverse events in both research groups made the HPV vaccine appear statistically safe. Dengue Vaccine: Dengvaxia trials were conducted with a true placebo group. However, the long-term follow-up revealed significant safety concerns, particularly in children not previously infected with dengue. Meningococcal Vaccines: Menactra trials used other meningococcal vaccines or historical controls rather than a double-blind placebo. The safety profile was based on comparisons with these fraudulent controls. The lack of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials for common childhood vaccines is a wake-up call for all parents and soon-to-be parents. If the true rate of adverse events is being significantly concealed using fake placebos, and the long-term efficacy is unknown, then the childhood vaccine schedule is fraudulent, needless, and poses unnecessary risks to kids.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-ipc-under-fire-allowing-transgender-compete-women.html,International Paralympic Committee under fire for allowing TRANSGENDER athlete to compete against women,"The International Paralympics Committee (IPC) is now under scrutiny for allowing the participation of a transgender athlete in the women's category in the 2024 Paris Paralympics for the first time in history. Transgender Italian sprinter Valentina Petrillo, 50, who transitioned to become a woman back in 2018 and started hormone therapy shortly after, has been selected by the Italian Paralympic Committee to compete in two categories – the women's 200-meter and 400-meter sprint competitions. She will run for both under the T12 category, a classification for athletes with visual impairments. Petrillo began competing as a woman in 2020 at the Italian Para Athletics Championships, marking the first time in the history of global para athletics that a transgender individual was allowed to compete not in a category that matches their biological sex. Before transitioning, Petrillo had already won 11 national titles in Italian para athletic competitions as a man. (Related: World Athletics bans transgender athletes from competing in female category at international events .) Petrillo's participation has sparked controversy in the sports community. For instance, Canada's former Olympic head coach, Peter Eriksen, described her participation as ""shocking,"" while Mara Yamauchi, the United Kingdom's third-fastest female marathon runner, questioned the fairness of the sports: ""How many 49-year-olds would win medals at world level?"" Even lawyer Fausta Quilleri, who also ran in the over-35s ""Master"" category in Italian para athletics competitions, petitioned the president of the Italian Athletics Federation and the ministries for Equal Opportunities and Sport in 2021 to exclude Petrillo from women’s races to no avail. ""Her physical superiority is so evident as to make competition unfair,"" she wrote, noting that the International Olympic Committee's focus on testosterone ""makes no sense"" when physique also affects athletic performance. Transgender researcher admits ""transwomen athletes really have physical advantages"" Andrew Parsons, the president of the IPC, acknowledged the criticism but stated the importance of adhering to established rules. ""We need to respect our rules, we cannot disrespect our rules,"" he said. ""So sometimes, as an individual, I think one way or another, but we need to follow our constitution, we need to follow our own rules, and, in specific sports, the rules of the international federations need to be respected."" ""So for the moment World Para Athletics rules allow her to compete, so she will be welcomed as any other athlete. I think it is just fair that we treat [transgender athletes] respectfully,"" he continued. ""But I do think science should give us the answer, because we also want to be fair with the other athletes in the field of play. It is a very difficult question. And science hopefully will be able to give us the answer. And what I would like to see in the future is that the whole of sport has a united position on it."" But then, Joanna Harper, a trans woman and researcher conducting studies on the specific impact of hormone therapy on trans women athletes at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at the Loughborough University in England, admitted that transwomen athletes do really have physical advantages over women . ""Transgender women are on average taller, bigger and stronger than cisgender women even after hormone therapy, and those are advantages in many sports,"" she said.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-18-doctors-brazil-evidence-mrna-vaccines-turbo-cancer.html,Doctors killed in Brazilian plane crash promised to release evidence tying mRNA “vaccines” to TURBO CANCER,"The other day, we reported that eight of the 62 (not 68 as was originally reported) people who died in the recent ATR 72 turboprop plane crash in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were doctors headed to an important oncology conference. It has since come out that six of these eight were also scientists who planned to expose mRNA (modRNA) ""vaccines"" as a cause of turbo cancer. The following six scientists were planning to do a really good thing before someone sabotaged the plane they were traveling on to ensure their message was never sent or received: 1) Dr. José Roberto Leonel Ferreira, a senior radiologist who had a significant impact in the field of radiology, particularly in pediatric radiology 2) Dr. Mariana Belim, an intensivist in the Adult ICU at the Western Paraná University Hospital (Huop) 3) Dr. Ariane Risso, also from the Uopeccan Cancer Hospital in Cascavel 4) Edilson Hobold, a professor of physical education 5) Deonir Secco, a professor of agricultural engineering 6) Raquel Ribeiro Moreira, a literature professor at the Cascavel campus All six of these individuals were highly respected professionals in their respective fields. The purpose of their travel was to share their expertise in front of a large audience, which apparently had to be stopped to keep a lid on the truth. The other two medical professionals who perished were resident medics, reports indicate. Assassinating the truth Had the plane been allowed to land safety rather than mysteriously crash in a residential neighborhood not far from the event, it would have exposed to the entire world the ugly truth about mRNA and what it does to the human body. The corporate media initially reported on the crash as a mere event, failing to explain who was aboard the plane. It took the independent media to dig a little bit deeper and discover that this was apparently an assassination effort aimed at some of the world's best minds. The 2nd Smartest Guy in the World Substack shared what is known as the ""new and improved synergistic Joe Tippens protocol"" which may help those suffering from mRNA-induced turbo cancer to overcome their illness. The protocol is as follows: - 400-800 milligrams of tocotrienol and tocopherol (all eight forms of vitamin E) every day, i.e., Gamma E by Life Extension of Perfect E - 600 mg per day of bioavailable curcumin, i.e., Theracurmin HP by Integrative Therapeutics - 62.5 micrograms (2,500 IU) of vitamin D every day - 1-2 droppers full (roughly 167-334 mg) daily of CBD-X, the most potent form of full-spectrum cannabidiol oil containing 5,000 mg of activated cannabinoids and hemp compounds, i.e., CBD, CBN, and CBG - 300 mg of fenbendazole six days a week, or up to one gram daily in the case of severe turbo cancers - 24mg daily of ivermectin, or up to one gram daily for severe turbo cancers - Two capsules of VIR-X immune support daily This protocol is said to work exceptionally well for turbo cancers, and there are links at 2ndsmartestguyintheworld.com for purchasing these recommended products. ""The loss of these doctors is a significant setback to the medical freedom movement in Brazil,"" commented Dr. Chris Flowers, MD. ""Pray for their families, and keep fighting. Several of us testify in National and international hearings on COVID and turbo cancers and will miss their input."" Another shared the story of her local doctor who was persecuted by the medical police state in Florida for treating Lyme disease patients. ""He had a visit by trench coats in the 2010’, in Florida, and was told to stop treating Lyme or he was done,"" this person explained. ""He's just waiting to retire now, a zombie since the jabs. A once brilliant doctor."" Big Pharma cannot afford for anyone to expose its mRNA deception. Learn more at BadMedicine.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-18-israel-verge-of-economic-mental-health-collapse.html,Israel is on the verge of economic and mental health collapse as corporations shutter operations and new projects are cancelled,"Iran, as well as the forces from its Axis of Resistance, has warned of retaliation against Israel soon and as the latter awaits the attacks, its economy and the mental health of its people continue to decline, bringing the nation to the brink of collapse . ""These two weeks have exhausted the market, as some economic activities have been canceled, and another part has been reduced due to public fear,"" the economic affairs commentator for Israel’s Channel 13 News said Thursday. The Israeli economy has already suffered in the 10 months of its genocidal attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. U.S. financial services firm Fitch even decided to downgrade the nation’s credit rating recently. Due to threats of violence, there were also massive cancellations of flights from international airlines and losses incurred by canceled domestic tourist tours as well as the impact on hotels and tourist areas in northern Palestine, wreaking havoc on the country’s tourism industry . The commentator also said that authorities now steer clear of holding mass festivals due to fear of shootings, bombings and other unfortunate events. They would not be able to bear the responsibility of direct casualties, he said. Israel’s education sector will also be severely affected if the wait continues into September, as institutions will have to ""maneuver within combat scenarios,"" according to the Channel 13 broadcaster. Meanwhile, health officials told GLZ Radio that the country has also seen an increase in ""suicidal situations, psychotic situations, and the use of dangerous substances"" among settlers over the past two weeks. A post by the radio station on X, formerly Twitter, indicated that the number of people applying for mental health screening at Rambam Hospital in Haifa has doubled in the last two weeks following the fear of Iran and Hezbollah's imminent retaliation. During a speech earlier this month, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah stressed that the ""long wait is part of the punishment and response,"" referring to the death of the late commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed by an Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. (Related: ""Entire Resistance Axis"" to retaliate against Israel for assassinating top Hamas leader .) His comments were echoed days later by the leader of Yemen’s Ansarallah resistance, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, who said that the response to Israel’s bombing of Hodeidah Port is ""inevitable."" ""The Israeli enemy, after the dangerous escalation from its side, is in a state of great fear in every sense of the word,"" Houthi said, adding that ""the inevitable response to the Israeli aggression that targeted the fuel tanks in Hodeidah port is a must, and it is coming, God willing."" Iran’s mixed signals set the region on edge Over the last two weeks, Israeli and U.S. officials sounded alarms about an imminent response. However, analysts say that the messaging from Iran and its powerful non-state partner seemed cryptic by design . In his televised addresses, Nasrallah said a response to the attack in southern Beirut was imminent as he dismissed Western attempts to prevent a retaliatory strike, saying they were futile. ""God willing, our response is coming,"" Nasrallah declared solemnly in one address warning that they may act alone or with the Axis, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that span Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Nasrallah and his backers have touted the benefits of the ""psychological war"" in which Israelis brace for an attack. However, there are also indications that Tehran is dragging its feet as it seemed to not be really interested in the prospect of triggering a wider war. According to a diplomat, Hezbollah and Iran had trapped themselves in their own vows of reprisals. Some have suggested that a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza may serve as an off-ramp, as the international community gears up for talks in Doha on Thursday. Iran has rejected the idea. On the other hand, there is a widespread view that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must keep a war going to keep his growing domestic problems at bay. ""It is highly questionable whether there is any deterrence to be re-established,"" said Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj Media, an online outlet covering the region. ""This is going to go on, and over time this is going to be very dangerous."" ""Iran and Hezbollah may have come to terms with this, recognizing that the open-endedness of their messaging around the anticipated response may be the strongest weapon at their disposal,"" CNN reported.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-18-gender-bender-insurrection-queer-caucus-harris-walz.html,GENDER-BENDER INSURRECTION: Get ready for the QUEER CAUCUS of Minnesota to try to “transition” the entire nation if Harris and Walz steal the election,"Welcome to the wars, on terror, health, drugs, CO2, the Constitution, elections and the nuclear family. Believe or not, there is a war for “ gender-affirming healthcare ” in the United States, which means queers want children and teens to be able to choose genitalia mutilation surgery and chemical castration drugs without any hinderances, including parental consent. The epicenter of the war on gender is spreading like a deadly virus, with the brunt of it now in Minnesota, where Kamala “Commie” Harris’s new VP pick does his gender-fluid governing “business.” This is all part of the pervert-the-youth movement that the communists and gays are pushing for the whole nation, not just Minnesota. They want the sex-crazed Queer Caucus to become a national refuge for children and teens who have been brainwashed into gayness by social media, so they will only think about sex, sex partners and sex-change operations and drugs 24/7/365, just like they (Queer Caucus lovers) do. The main goal is to destroy the nuclear family and distract everyone from crooked politics that take away rights, freedoms, health, normal thoughts and self-esteem of the populace. It’s communism to the core, and the LGBTQ-Asexual-demi-pans-gray-cis-trans-non-binary-gender-""neutral"" queers are running the drag show from the heart of Minnesota, and from sea to not-so-shiny sea. Will the Queer Caucus Pandemic spread across the country? Get ready for a new queer amendment to the constitution folks. This is not a joke. Queer Caucus plans to introduce Gender Affirming Rights Act as part of the Constitution to enshrine sex-crazed tranny-ism Get ready for the Gender Affirming Rights Act (GARA) coming to a gender-fluid country where you reside. No more health care regulations against it, now the U.S. government (demented Liberals and Demoncrats) are making the gender-bender INSURRECTION a permanent fixture of laws, education and daycare centers nationwide. Sex ed for all, and one size fits all. Nothing’s inappropriate anymore, now that there’s no such thing as male or female, according to the groomer’s union of child mutilators and sex offenders. The Deep State wants your children, and they are not only right up front about it, they are trying to make it the law that they control your kids’ gender, sex thoughts, sex education and complete and open ""access"" to sex change operations, sex “changing” drugs, SSRIs, and all without your permission. Parents, are you ready for this? The Queer Caucus King , Tim Walz (Democrat VP choice), who has secretly (until now) traveled to Communist China to do “business,” wants to queer out the whole country while ushering in a new Nanny State plandemic, under the guise of Bird-Monkey-AIDS-Covid25-Syndrome. Better mask up and distance yourself. Best to stay indoors until this whole thing (full-blown Communism) blows over. The Queer Caucus is already in full swing in America. The leader of the pack, the creepy cadaver known as Joe Biden, is still somehow president, terrorizing innocent children at every presser and rally, inappropriately touching little girls and boys, sniffing their hair, holding them while they try to escape him. Tim “Nazi” Walz of Minnesota has a saying for it, that goes, “One person’s socialism is another person's neighborliness.” In his book, people are property too. Kamilla the Hun Harris calls it “equitable” treatment. LGBT-Queer lawmakers are forming the Minnesota Legislature’s first Queer Caucus to stop parents from interfering in their children’s choice to have their penises cut off, breasts removed and other heinous surgeries to the genitalia, in the name of “gender fluidity.” They want the law on their side when they are “fending off” the community of normal people who don’t want their kids thinking and acting perverted and demented all day (even though they don't respect the laws that prevent it). This goes for teen girls choosing late-term abortions and day-of-birth abortions also, which Tim “Nazi” Walz also supports. No age is too low for gender-bender surgery and education , not even toddlers, according to the demented Biden Administration, with its new commie frontrunners. Check the facts on that. Tune your internet dial to Gender.news for updates on extreme liberals with hidden agendas trying to turn normal kids into gender-confused freaks for life. It’s just “weird.” "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-18-medical-board-revokes-certifications-pro-ivermectin-doctors.html,U.S. medical board REVOKES certifications of pro-ivermectin doctors who challenged COVID-19 vaccines,"A major U.S. medical board has revoked the certifications of two physicians who promoted the use of the much safer ivermectin against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) over the deadly injections. The Defender reported that the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) revoked the certifications of Drs. Pierre Kory and Paul Marik, founders of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC). Kory served as the former president of the organization, while Marik serves as its chief scientific officer. The revocation followed the board's two-year probe into the two doctors' promotion of ivermerctin and hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 treatments, alongside their statements questioning the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 injections. According to the Washington Post , the two continued ""to promote ivermectin, an anti-parasitic medication, as a treatment for COVID-19 long after the medical community found it to be ineffective."" The outlet also cited unnamed experts who claimed the the FLCCC ""spread misinformation about the [COVID-19] pandemic. A summary of the ABIM's decision reviewed by the Defender pointed out that the conduct of Kory and Marik ""poses serious concerns for patient safety and undermines the trust that the public and the medical profession place in the meaning of ABIM board certification."" The FLCCC expressed its categorical disagreement with the decision in an Aug. 14 statement . ""We believe this decision represents a dangerous shift away from the foundational principles of medical discourse and scientific debate that have historically been the bedrock of medical education associations,"" it stated. ""It's essential that we continue to discuss and debate all perspectives if we are to uphold the integrity of our profession,"" Marik said. ""Without open scientific debate, we risk losing the opportunity to discover better treatments, such as proven repurposed drugs for new viruses, and to provide the best patient care and save lives."" ""This fight is about more than just our right to speak – it's about protecting the future of healthcare,"" said Kory. ""When doctors are silenced for questioning the prevailing narrative, we all lose."" Dr. Meryl Nass also targeted in MEDICAL LAWFARE efforts MedPageToday noted that prior to the revocation, Marik holds ABIM certifications in internal medicine and critical care medicine. Meanwhile, Kory also holds the same ABIM certifications as Marik – with an extra certification in pulmonary disease. Kory and Marik aren't the only ones in the ABIM's crosshairs, however. Even Dr. Meryl Nass has found herself incurring the board's wrath, leading to the revocation of her certification without her knowledge. She told the Defender that she was blindsided by the move. ""After the Maine Medical Board (MMB) suspended my license illegally – even though none of my alleged transgressions met the statutory requirement for an immediate suspension – the [MMB] later found me guilty of things I had not done and continued the suspension. All of this with never a single patient complaint,"" said Nass. ""Now I learn, by chance, that the ABIM has suspended me without ever informing me I was even under an investigation – which is illegal according to [its] process."" Nass also explained why a board certification is important for her. She said that getting hospital privileges and collecting insurance reimbursements would be very difficult without it. Despite this, Nass remarked that she could potentially work on her own ""if patients paid me directly."" The beleaguered physician from Maine ultimately blasted organizations like ABIM for engaging in what she dubbed as ""medical lawfare."" She accused the board of ""creating crimes that do not exist, using procedures that do not exist, to try and silence people."" ""The COVID-19 vaccines are very dangerous. They don't prevent COVID-19. Drugs can effectively treat COVID-19 , and I prescribed those drugs and helped hundreds of Maine citizens. That was my crime."" (Related: Japanese study finds that ivermectin is ""safe and effective"" for treating covid. ) Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough, whose certifications were revoked by the ABIM in 2022, also put in his two cents on the three doctors' predicaments. ""The ABIM is violating principles of equal protection, due process, rules of evidence and has gone ex post facto to find reasons to attack qualified ABIM-certified doctors who innovated and saved lives early in the pandemic,"" he told the Defender .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-alabama-boxes-mothers-anonymously-dump-babies.html,Alabama sets up boxes where mothers can anonymously dump their unwanted newborn babies,"Alabama’s recently expanded Safe Haven Law allows for “baby boxes” to be installed on the exterior walls of fire stations and hospitals where mothers can anonymously dump their unwanted babies. Footage shared on X demonstrating how the box operates shows a safe-like structure with a heavy door that opens to reveal a sad-looking box where mothers can “surrender” their babies without facing legal repercussions; the other side of the box has a transparent window with ventilation holes and opens up inside the facility where it is installed. These boxes are installed at sites that have emergency workers on site 24/7, and an alarm inside the box alerts them that a baby has been placed inside. Cameras are installed inside the box as well, and the interior is a climate-controlled environment. When the door is opened, an orange bag drops out that contains information for the mother, such as where to get free counseling, medical information and resources for victims of human trafficking. This information is also available on their website , where they explain what physical and mental symptoms are normal after giving birth, how to stop the flow of breast milk, and what symptoms to look out for; this information is also provided in Spanish. There is also documentation about the mother’s legal rights and what they can do if they change their mind – a process that entails petitioning courts for the return of custody and undergoing genetic testing to confirm they are the parent. When the alarm goes off, medics will remove the baby from the box, carry out an initial exam and bring the baby to a local hospital for a more in-depth exam and any needed treatment. They will also confirm that the baby has not been reported missing. It will then be placed in the care of the state’s child protective services before becoming eligible for adoption. The boxes can be used within 45 days of birth, and they provide an alternative way for mothers to hand over babies who may be uncomfortable bringing them to emergency rooms and seeing hospital personnel face to face. U.S. now has 257 boxes for abandoning babies Alabama isn’t the only state to set up these boxes; they are increasingly being installed throughout the nation. When the state of Kentucky installed its 39th “safe haven baby box” this week, it marked the 257th such box in the nation . The idea is to prevent unsafe abandonments. Every year, there are numerous stories around the country of women leaving babies in dumpsters, public restrooms and other inappropriate locations because they couldn’t face authorities or feared they would be recognized. In many cases, these babies end up dying. However, the idea of dumping a helpless newborn in a box and hoping the system works as it should is pretty tough to process, and it’s also not a very cheap option. The initial fee for baby boxes in Alabama is more than $15,000, with yearly recertification and upkeep fees of $500 and further fees of as much as $7,000 related to delivery, transportation, installation and alarm services. That’s a very expensive (and often taxpayer-funded) solution to a “problem” that already has multiple other solutions already available, including dropping off babies that can’t be cared for in person at fire stations, hospitals or other locations designated by each state as safe havens where babies can be left without mothers facing legal repercussions.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-cdc-had-to-change-definition-of-vaccines.html,“VACCINES” REDEFINED: CDC had to change the definition of “vaccines” so that mRNA would not be discredited by its own description,"The Trojan Horse of ‘vaccinations’ is the mRNA jab, where your cells are ‘broken into’ and re-instructed to produce billions of microscopic virus clone particles that can stick together anywhere in the vascular system, cleansing organs or the brain. There is NOTHING like this in the history of vaccinations. Now, these virus clones are scientifically being identified as ‘nanoparticles’ that may be able to be programmed to join together and even target certain parts of the body or brain. Again, this is NOTHING like any “vaccine” ever created before in the deep, dark history of a world corroded with dirty immunizations. That brings us to the old school definition of vaccination, and how they were all described under one (fake) definition umbrella, versus the new modified, amended, twisted and warped definition, that’s wickedly crafted to sound “safe and effective” just like all the rest of the dirty lot. This is the great culling. The most effective weapon of mass destruction ever created – mRNA “vaccines.” A vaccine is a biological preparation that is supposed to help the body “acquire” immunity, but this has never been verified. Vaccines contain agents that resemble disease-causing microorganisms, so true immunity could only come naturally, and that’s why true immunity lasts so much longer than any vaccine “effect” or “adverse effect.” With mRNA, science shows immunity is WEAKENED with every new jab , including the boosters, that can create an AIDS-LIKE disorder of the cells and completely wreck the biological seat of immunity. This is a key difference in vaccines that we’ve never seen before and required a massive change in the definition purported by the Sick-Care-Information-Complex of America (SCICA), including Google, Wikipedia, CDC, AMA, FDA and all the shill scientists and MDs behind the Covid scamdemic. Fact: The CDC changed the definition of vaccination because mRNA did not fit, and they did not want it to be discredited in this way Natural health advocates have been calling out dirty vaccines since the Polio paralysis scare, but now vaccines call themselves out as dirty as we see the horrific health carnage the mRNA jabs have caused across the globe, and it’s about to get a whole lot worse. The mRNA stab experiment failed billions of guinea pig people. Not only are mRNA “clot shot” gene-mutation injections proven ineffective at prevention or transmission of “Covid-19,” but they are detrimental to all body systems, including the vascular system, digestion, cognition, central nervous system, immune system and the reproductive system as well. Changes made to the definition of vaccination across the internet were said to have been made to prevent misinformation, but if the definition was dead wrong to begin with, then now it becomes disinformation, which is even more dangerous, because it’s written with malicious intent. The Associated Press is “all in” on this, with Wikipedia following suit. The insidious vaccine cult of scientists that conspired to create the nightmare had to get out in front of the wave of truth media that was coming with the billions of injuries and hundreds of millions of deaths caused BY the spike protein DNA-altering “technology” of these new “vaccinations.” Before Covid mRNA jabs, a vaccination was an “injection of a killed or weakened infectious organism in order to prevent disease.” Simple right? But wait, because the word vaccination has now been repurposed. That’s right, repurposed. Let us blame technology for any errors, omissions, and mass death by genocide this time around. The technology of mRNA is the most insane experiment ever carried out on humans, not to mention most humans on planet earth. Only 2.2 billion people in the world did NOT get vaccinated for Covid. Since there are currently 8 billion people on Earth, that means nearly 6 billion are suffering from some level of spike protein syndrome right now. Now human cells produce the enemy forever, driving the immune system mad, like mad cow disease, but it’s mad Covid spike PRION disease instead. Now, messenger RNA cells are hijacked like a cellular machine taught to produce billions of virus clones, and never stop. Humans have been targeted for destruction , and this fits the new definition of vaccination. Get it? Got cancer, parasites, dementia, depression, auto-immune disorder, blood clots or VAIDS? That's the new ""vaccine"" technology that you're highly allergic to, my friends. Bookmark Vaccines.news to your favorite independent websites for updates on new names for the same old problem, and that’s short-and-long-term repercussions of dangerous and dirty “vaccines,” now including myocarditis, pericarditis, heart attacks, strokes, PCVS, SPS and Long-Vax-Syndrome .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-tim-walz-pro-abortion-stance-worse-pelosi.html,Op-ed: Tim Walz has a more radical PRO-ABORTION stance than former House Speaker Pelosi,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee, has a pro-abortion stance much more radical than that of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), according to an op-ed. The Aug. 13 piece by Bob Bird, former chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP), expounded on the liberal governor's stance. According to him, Walz reportedly defied Pelosi's advice to tone down his pro-infanticide rhetoric. Bird cited a video where the Minnesota governor justified his signing of a bill that allowed elective abortion up until birth. ""My record is so pro-choice, Pelosi asked me if I could tone it down,"" said Walz, who served in the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. ""I stand with Planned Parenthood, and we won."" (Related: Tim Walz left EIGHT babies who survived botched abortions to DIE, government data shows. ) Revolver News also commented on the aforementioned video, noting that the Democratic vice presidential nominee ""is actually proud of his extreme abortion views, which are legalizing first-degree murder."" It continued: ""So when Pelosi told him to tone it down, he flipped out on stage, showing a kind of demonic bloodlust we’ve never seen before."" According to a separate LifeSiteNews report, the proposal signed by Walz dubbed the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act ""asserts a woman's 'fundamental right' to “continue the pregnancy and give birth, or obtain an abortion."" This measure was signed into law in January of last year , to the consternation of pro-life groups in the North Star State. ""The PRO Act would mean it's legal for any baby to be aborted, for any reason and at any time up to birth,"" said Cathy Blaeser, co-executive director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life. ""The absolutist extremism of this bill would put Minnesota in the company of just a handful of countries worldwide, among them China and North Korea."" Bird also sarcastically congratulated Walz for his defense of infanticide, writing in the op-ed: ""Wow, that took courage, Mr. Walz. You out-lefted Pelosi."" Bird highlights Walz's cowardice in op-ed The former AIP chairman and senatorial candidate also highlighted several instances of Walz's cowardice in the Aug. 13 op-ed. First, he highlighted the Minnesota governor's military service built on lies. Bird described Walz as a ""chicken hawk"" – which pertained to ""politicians who were eager to use military force, but to let others do it."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney was the personality often branded with this moniker. Bird explained that Walz is a chicken hawk for parading his military service, ostensibly to show courage. ""But now the truth about Walz is emerging,"" he wrote. ""He resigned from his unit when it was going to be deployed to Iraq. His own compatriots … are telling about his shameful resignation to the alternative media and how the entire structure of the unit was compromised by needing to bring in unfamiliar replacements."" Second, Bird highlighted Walz's opposition to the Second Amendment, which the Constitution guarantees. During a gubernatorial campaign stop, he told audience members that gun control was necessary and that he proudly disowned the National Rifle Association. ""I have handled weapons in war,"" he said at the time, adding that citizens shouldn't be possessing these firearms. ""It never occurred to Walz that his own citizens of Minnesota might need them to protect their life and property during the 2020 [Black Lives Matter] riots, when he delayed calling out the National Guard. He [also] spoke of how the riots were 'exciting' and were 'restoring a sense of optimism coming back.'"" Bird ultimately warned: ""We are dealing with the demonic in this election; whatever flaws exist in the alternatives pale before the reality of this evil, lying, wicked, cowardly, bullying, doubling-down national ticket of death. You will not be safe with these people."" Head over to CancelDemocrats.news for more stories about Tim Walz. Watch U.S. Sen.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-who-warns-new-mutant-strain-of-monkeypox.html,Here comes the fear: The WHO warns that the new mutant strain of monkeypox is an emergency “for the entire globe”,"It was fun while it lasted. We actually had quite a few months without an official “global health emergency” to be concerned about, but now that streak is over. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced that Monkeypox has officially been classified as a “public health emergency of international concern”. Health officials have lost control of the new mutant strain that is spreading in Africa, and so that is why this move was made. Compared to the strain that caused so much chaos in 2022, this new strain has a much higher death rate and we are being told that in many cases it is spreading without any sexual contact at all. If this thing gets loose in the United States and Europe, the level of fear that we will witness will be off the charts. (Article republished from EndOfTheAmericanDream.com ) For now, the only confirmed cases of this new mutant strain of Monkeypox are all in central Africa. But it is probably only a matter of time before it spreads to more areas. The head of the committee that determined that a “public health emergency of international concern” was warranted says that this new strain is an emergency “for the entire globe” … Committee Chair Professor Dimie Ogoina said, “The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe. Mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022. It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself.” Originally, all of the confirmed cases of the “clade 1b” strain were limited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But now more than 100 cases have been confirmed in the neighboring countries of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda… In the past month, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighbouring the DRC that have not reported mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Experts believe the true number of cases to be higher as a large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested. The strategy of containment has officially failed. At this point, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is openly admitting that “the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying”… “The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying,” Tedros said during the briefing. So what do we know about this new strain? Well, first of all we are being told that it has a much higher death rate … Read more at: EndOfTheAmericanDream.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-who-warns-monkeypox-global-emergency.html,WHO warns that new monkeypox strain is a global emergency,"The World Health Organization issued a warning yesterday about monkeypox, officially classifying it as a “public health emergency of international concern,” the highest level of international health law alarm. They also identified a few features of the new mutant strain that make it more worrying than previous iterations. The strain that circulated in 2022 got a lot of hype as the COVID-19 pandemic was still front and center in many people’s minds, but it ended up being far less threatening as it was spread largely through sexual contact among gay and bisexual men and was not particularly fatal. However, the new strain has a much higher death rate, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that the new clade 1 strain can kill as many as 10% of individuals who contract it, while the previously circulating clade 2 strain had a 99% survival rate. In some cases, the virus is being passed among people who are not believed to have had any sexual contact whatsoever, and most of the cases and deaths reported in the current outbreak in Congo have involved children. Authorities are not sure why this is the case. One infectious diseases expert said that it may be that children are more vulnerable, and that social factors such as exposure to parents with the disease and overcrowding may also be contributing factors. Although this new strain can be passed through sexual contact like the previous one and is being transmitted through local sex work, it also appears to be spreading within households and from mothers to their children. Some cases have even been reported of person-to-person spread outside of homes and without any sexual contact, which means it has more opportunities to spread. While it is currently confined to central Africa, there are concerns it could spread to other areas given its easier transmissibility. All confirmed cases of the stronger “Clade 1b” strain were initially limited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but authorities now claim that more than 100 confirmed cases have already been reported in nearby countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya. The chair of the WHO emergency committee, Dimie Ogoina, said: “It was unanimous that the current outbreak of mpox, upsurge of mpox, is an extraordinary event. What we have in Africa is the tip of the iceberg. … We are not recognizing, or we don’t have the full picture of, this burden of mpox.” More hype or a genuine emergency? If all of this turns out to be true, it is indeed quite worrying. However, there is also a possibility that this is being overblown, and some people believe the intention is to drive demand for vaccines given how profitable they proved to be during the COVID-19 pandemic . Last week, World Health Organization officials said the virus can be contained “quite straightforwardly, if we do the right things at the right time” and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday: “It’s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.” They have signed off on an Emergency Use Listing process for the two existing monkeypox vaccines . There are currently half a million doses of the vaccines in stock, and they predict that another 2.4 million could be made by the end of the year. Not surprisingly, shares of monkeypox vaccine makers such as Bavarian Nordic skyrocketed following the WHO’s public health emergency declaration, jumping as much as 17% in early trading, while Emergent BioSolutions’ shares soared 12%.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-mental-resilience-crisis-strategies-for-staying-calm.html,The importance of mental resilience in crisis situations: Strategies for staying calm when SHTF,"When preparing for different emergencies, you should keep in mind that mental and emotional preparedness is just as important as your food stockpile. This ensures that when SHTF, you can stay calm and help your family stay safe no matter what scenario you are facing. (h/t to PrepForceOne.com ) Emergencies are often very stressful and demanding. But if you know how to strengthen your mental preparedness , things won't seem so scary when SHTF. How to develop a resilient mindset Resilience means being able to recover from difficult situations and knowing how to adapt to challenging situations. Here are some tips on how to develop a resilient mindset: Try to have a positive outlook It can be difficult but try to practice gratitude and focus on the good things. Having an optimistic perspective can help you maintain motivation and find solutions to different problems when SHTF. Practice flexibility Practicing flexibility means being open to change and adaptability. Prepping involves a lot of planning, but you should also accept that things won't always go as planned during emergencies. At the same time, being flexible helps you adapt quickly to find alternative solutions. Develop emotional regulation Being able to manage and regulate your emotions effectively can help you identify and acknowledge your emotions. This skill also helps you find healthy ways to process and express them, such as through meditation. You can also try journaling or talking to a loved one. Sharpen your problem-solving skills You can improve your problem-solving skills by practicing critical thinking and logical reasoning. Even if disaster doesn't strike, always try to look for creative solutions and approach problems from different perspectives. Negative behaviors to avoid When SHTF , it can be easy to revert to self-serving behaviors that can make the situation worse. Stay calm in a crisis and avoid these negative behaviors : Abandoning your family or fellow preppers to save yourself Not communicating to clear up any issues or misunderstandings Blaming others when things go wrong Forgetting your emergency plans or procedures while in a state of panic Learn how to recognize negative behaviors and try to meet the immediate needs of your family when SHTF. How to care for your mental health Just as you would need food to keep up your energy when facing emergencies, you need emotional reserves to care for your mental health , particularly during stressful situations. These strategies can help you build emotional reserves: Self-care Try self-care activities that promote relaxation, such as exercise, meditation, reading or spending time in nature. Addressing both physical and emotional needs can help develop emotional resilience. Develop strong relationships Even preppers know the importance of having strong relationships. Develop meaningful relationships with fellow preppers to build a strong support network. During stressful times, social connections can provide emotional support. Your family and friends can also offer different perspectives and create a sense of belonging in emergencies. Seek emotional support When facing difficult situations, you should seek emotional support from family, friends, or mental health professionals (if available). If you are stressed, talking about your worries can help relieve stress and give a new perspective. (Related: How to remain calm in stressful situations .) Coping mechanisms that can help Before SHTF, you should develop effective coping mechanisms for mental and emotional preparedness. These techniques can help: Stress reduction techniques If you are often struggling with stress, stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation can help calm the mind and alleviate anxiety . Maintain Routines Maintaining routines even after SHTF can give you a sense of stability and control. Simple routines, such as maintaining regular meal times can also give you a sense of much-needed comfort and structure. Find meaning even after SHTF Things can seem hopeless when dealing with emergencies. If you are having dark thoughts, try to identify your values and what gives your life meaning. Find a sense of purpose and think of the big picture during difficult times. Focusing on meaning and purpose can provide motivation and resilience if you feel like you have lost your purpose during an emergency.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-16-chinese-scientists-create-mutant-ebola-virus.html,They never learn: Chinese scientists create mutant EBOLA virus,"Chinese scientists have engineered a pathogen with parts of the Ebola virus in a laboratory, ostensibly to better study the eponymous disease it causes – but conveniently forgetting the lessons of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Big League Politics reported, citing the Daily Mail , that researchers at Hebei Medical University were responsible for this dangerous endeavor. The scientists ""utilized a contagious disease of livestock and added a protein found in Ebola, which allows the pathogen to infect cells and spread throughout the human body."" This oddly mirrored the gain-of-function research done with bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which later gave rise to COVID-19. The resulting pathogen was then injected into hamsters, who died within two to three days. Predictably, those given the lethal virus ""developed severe systemic diseases similar to those observed in human Ebola patients – including multi-organ failure"" as per the study published in the journal Virologica Sinica . ""One particularly horrific symptom saw the infected hamsters develop secretions in their eyes, which impaired their vision and scabbed over the surface of the eyeballs."" ""The study suggested that infected hamsters could be a decent model for studying the spread and treatment of Ebola in the future,"" the Mail pointed out. ""But lab leaks happen, and these incidents could lead to the spread of [the modified pathogen] to those outside of the lab. Ebola needs to be handled in Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) facilities which are special high security laboratories, while many are only BSL-2. The WIV is one example of a BSL-4 facility, but SARS-CoV-2 – a product of gain-of-function research – managed to escape its confines. ""Apparently, the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic haven't been learned. Dangerous biolab experiments continue – humanity be damned,"" Big League Politics said. China making the next BIOWEAPON against humanity The Mail continued that the researchers harvested organs from the dead animals. They found that the virus accumulated in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, intestines and brain tissues. The highest viral load was found in the liver, while the lowest was in the brain. Given the stringent BSL-2 security requirement for Ebola, the scientists used the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for their experiment. They engineered VSV, which mainly infects livestock, to carry a part of the Ebola virus called glycoprotein (GP). The GP plays a crucial role in helping the virus enter and infect host cells. (Related: HUMAN LAB RATS: Getting ""vaccinated"" for monkeypox automatically enrolls you in WHO data collection ""clinical trial."" ) According to Big League Politics, Ebola ravaged parts of Africa 10 years ago. The National Library of Medicine defines Ebola virus disease, formerly called Ebola hemorrhagic fever, as an ""iconic hemorrhagic fever."" More common symptoms of the disease are non-specific such as fever, malaise, headache, diarrhea or vomiting. Ebola virus disease can quickly progress to multiple organ failure leading to shock, followed by death. The case fatality rate ranges from between 25 and 90 percent, with the average rate about 50 percent. ""Experts have confirmed that respiratory viruses – which are spared via coughing and sneezing – are more likely to spread widely through a population,"" the British tabloid continued."" Data released this March revealed that lab leak incidents occur every year and include the release of controlled pathogens like tuberculosis and anthrax.

(Article by Christopher Tomlinson republished from TheNationalPulse.com ) Footage of the Youth Parliament shared on X (formerly Twitter) shows a young member receiving raucous cheers for stating that he is proud to be Muslim and Pakistani . Another says the biggest issue facing the United Kingdom is Kashmir, a region along the Indian-Pakistani border, halfway around the world. Some participants contend that black youths in places like London are unjustly profiled with respect to Britain’s ongoing problem with stabbings and other forms of knife crime. The recent deadly mass stabbing of three girls, aged just six, seven, and nine, at a Taylor Swift -themed dance class in Southport was allegedly carried out by a black teenager born to Rwandan parents.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-15-facebook-censors-biologist-richard-dawkins-transwomen-boxing-olympics.html,Facebook censors biologist Richard Dawkins for saying male “transwomen” boxers shouldn’t fight women at Olympics,"After posting online that biological males should not be allowed to fight biological females as ""transwomen"" in the Olympics, famed biologist Richard Dawkins was canceled from Facebook . Instead of the usual ""hate speech"" accusation, Dawkins received no reason at all from the Mark Zuckerberg platform as to why his account was axed in an instant following his comments about transgenders in sports. ""This content isn't available right now,"" now reads the prompt when trying to access Dawkins' page. ""When this happens, it's usually because the owner only shared it with a small group of people, changed who can see it or it's been deleted."" In Dawkins' case, the first two options do not apply. It is the third option that appears to have happened, against his will. ""My entire @facebook account has been deleted, seemingly (no reason given) because I tweeted that genetically male boxers such as Imane Khalif (XY undisputed) should not fight women in Olympics,"" Dawkins later tweeted on X. ""Of course my opinion is open to civilised argument. But outright censorship?"" (Related: In 2021, Dawkins was canceled as 1996 humanist of the year for tweeting about transgenderism.) Transgender triggering Now that the Olympic Games are over, those who watched them or caught headlines about them are conversing about the LGBT perversion that was on display, including the drag queen ""last supper"" mock-up. Dawkins and others are also upset that men pretending to be ""transwomen"" participated in boxing and other sports at the Olympics. Women invading and taking over men's spaces has been going on for decades, but now that women are feeling the heat of men invading theirs, the internet is abuzz with outrage. For whatever reason, the Olympics have decided to allow ""transwomen"" to participate in boxing, even though the International Boxing Association (IBA) banned ""transwomen"" from participating in last year's World Boxing Championships. ""This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors,"" the IBA said in a statement about why it prohibited both Khalif and another ""transwoman"" named Lin Yu-ting from participation. IBA president Umar Kremlev further admitted to the Russian news agency TASS that DNA tests on Khalif and Yu-ting ""proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded from the sports events."" Dawkins echoed this by stating on social media that these two boxers are ""XY undisputed,"" which is a scientific fact. Even so, Facebook does not approve of this scientific fact, preferring instead to silence people who tell it. ""Why anyone uses Facebook is a mystery to me,"" one perplexed commenter wrote about the story. "" All social media is an information-gathering appliance for intelligence communities,"" wrote another about how Big Brother loves social media and what it produces to further its agenda. ""Twitter / X plays the 'free speech' card so you'll speak more freely, but is increasingly making it difficult to use without supplying government-issued ID. All of them want you to talk, talk, talk and you'll hear a big sucking sound which is your data and privacy."" Fortunately for Dawkins, Facebook is not a big money-maker like YouTube is. Getting deplatformed on the latter usually means having to take a big cut in revenue from advertising. Facebook, on the other hand, takes everything from its users while giving back nothing. ""If you want to exercise free speech on social media, you have to create your own platform like Andrew Torba did,"" another commenter wrote.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-15-abortions-almost-zero-texas-near-total-ban.html,Abortions drop to ALMOST ZERO in Texas after state’s near-total ban on infanticide,"A recent Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) report has revealed that the number of abortions in Texas has plummeted to almost zero after the Lone Star State imposed a near-total abortion ban in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The report, which covers the period from July 2022 to March 2024, highlights a continuous decrease in the number of abortions – from thousands per month to virtually none. This data has been analyzed and corroborated by the Texas Alliance for Life. Texas, recognized as one of the most restrictive states regarding abortion laws by the Guttmacher Institute, has seen the effects of the Human Life Protection Act, which bans abortions with very limited exceptions. (Related: Abortions in Texas drop 97% after Roe v. Wade overturn .) According to the Act, abortions are only permitted when there is a serious risk of substantial impairment to a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. During the 21 months covered in the report, doctors in Texas performed 102 medically necessary abortions, with five of these procedures occurring in hospitals in March. Some experts don't actually believe in ""medically necessary"" abortion. ""The narrative that pro-life laws will prevent treatment of life-threatening complications affecting pregnant women , requiring them to travel out of state to access necessary medical care is blatantly false,"" said Dr. Ingrid Skop when she testified to the U.S. Senate. Skop is a member of Texas' Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee. Arkansas and Indiana also reported an abortion drop in June A report from the Society for Family Planning, a pro-abortion group, tried to downplay the data and claimed that abortions are higher after the reversal of Roe v. Wade. But other reports indicate that this drop in abortions is not isolated in Texas. Other states like Arkansas and Indiana have also reported massive drops in abortions performed after their states passed similar abortion restrictions into law. In June, the Induced Abortion Report, released by the Arkansas Department of Health, showed that the state reported no abortion in 2023 . This marks a significant drop from the 3,133 abortions reported in 2021, the last full year abortion was available. Meaning to say, the nearly total abortion ban, which went into effect after the reversal of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, has been effective. Similarly, in June, the Terminated Pregnancy Report from the Indiana State Department of Health also revealed that there were only 45 abortions reported in the state between Jan. 1 to Mar. 31. This marks a 98 percent drop from the same time in 2023 after a state law went into effect to ban nearly all abortions. Check out Abortions.news for more stories related to the murder of the unborn.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-15-dangerous-chemicals-inhaling-when-wearing-face-masks.html,Are you aware that you’re inhaling toxic chemicals when you wear a face mask?,"Wearing face masks has become a global norm following the onset of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with many governments around the world often mandating these coverings for people in public. But recent research reveals concerning findings about their safety. Masks, especially surgical and reusable FFF types have been found to emit potentially harmful chemical compounds . A study published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety in April 2024 highlighted that masks could release up to almost 5,400 microplastic particles in 24 hours , with surgical masks emitting more than 3,150 microfibers in under an hour. Researchers from Germany and Switzerland reviewed 24 studies, involving more than 630 masks, including cloth, N95 and surgical varieties. They discovered that 63 percent of the masks released alarming amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics, organophosphate esters and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compared to other mask types. (Related: N95 masks expose wearers to dangerous levels of toxic cancer- and seizure-causing compounds, study finds .) Meanwhile, surgical masks were linked to higher emissions of heavy metals, phthalates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) similar to textile masks. Some of the detected substances, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), titanium dioxide (TiO2) and VOCs, were found to exceed safe exposure limits. A 2022 study published in Nature also raised concerns about TiO2, a potential carcinogen , urging stricter regulations. Study finds plasticizers, heavy metals, PFAS and VOCs in face masks A recent study published in Environment International examined four types of face masks to identify the presence of 31 plasticizers and to assess how much of these compounds could be inhaled during use. Plasticizers are plastic-derived substances added to materials during the manufacturing process to make them softer and more flexible . Although all mask types had similar overall plasticizer levels, the study found that surgical and FFF2 masks commonly used in Europe have the highest plasticizer release rates at almost four percent and nearly five percent, respectively. The Environmental and Water Chemistry for Human Health group conducted the research at the Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research in Barcelona, Spain. The researchers highlighted that most face masks are made from synthetic materials, like polypropylene, polystyrene terephthalate and polyester, with plasticizers added to enhance fire resistance, flexibility and softness. Heavy metals, PFAS and VOCs were found in others. To simulate real-life mask use, the researchers conducted inhalation experiments using paper mache dummy heads. Higher temperatures – resembling human breath – led to increased release of plastic additives. Release rates varied significantly, ranging from 0.1 percent to 95 percent, depending on the compound and mask type. Notably, organophosphate esters and phthalates showed average release rates of 1.0 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Surgical and FFF2 masks had the highest overall release rates, while reusable masks showed the lowest at 0.6 percent. N95 masks had a 1.2 percent release rate. One concerning finding was a surgical mask that released 95 percent of a compound called acetyl tributyl citrate, a potential endocrine disruptor. While the released plasticizer levels remained below established safety thresholds, the researchers emphasized that face masks represent an additional exposure pathway. The study warns that even at low levels, exposure to plasticizers poses genotoxic (DNA damage), immunotoxic (affects the immune system) and teratogenic (causes birth defects) risks, especially for vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women. Additionally, plasticizers have been linked to declining sperm counts and potential fertility issues, raising concerns about their impact on future generations.

Prior to this, it was not believed that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) could coexist with monkeypox in the same host. They are now saying it can, probably to scare the world into fearing another ""pandemic."" The man reportedly tested positive for COVID after returning from a trip to Spain. When he went to the hospital to treat a rash, the man found out that he is also suffering from monkeypox. As treatment, the man was given a combination antiretroviral treatment that he will have to take for the rest of his life due to also having HIV – watch the news clip below : The first person ever diagnosed with COVID-Monkey-AIDS-Pox. This is getting serious guys. pic.twitter.com/xG2Lt5N83f — Champagne Joshi (@JoshWalkos) August 12, 2024 (Related: Did you know that monkeypox is a gay disease spread through homosexual activity, not normal skin contact?) They just won't stop with the viruses You can probably tell that some very powerful people are desperate to strike fear into the general public about another COVID-like disease threat. They tried monkeypox, then bird flu, then monkeypox again, and now this four-in-one mutant virus – what will it be next? ""Sir, we have bad news: your cancer got AIDS and was infected by monkeypox,"" someone on X joked about how ridiculous this all sounds. ""The only way to treat this is by changing your gender."" Chances are if enough people get sick with strange mutant diseases like this, they will cart out another ""vaccine"" at warp speed to ""treat"" everyone as quickly as possible. ""When they start pushing a monkeypox vaccine and mandates requiring everyone to wear masks, don't forget how it started,"" wrote another. The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that monkeypox cases are rising to the point that a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was declared this week, this being the highest level of alarm under international health law. WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called a meeting last week to discuss a possible PHEIC declaration. Less than a week later, a PHEIC was declared. ""The Emergency Committee's advice to me, and that of the [Africa CDC], which yesterday declared a public health emergency of regional security, are aligned,"" Tedros said in a post on X. The claim is that many different strains of monkeypox are circulating across Africa right now, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. ""In addition to other outbreaks of other clades of mpox in other parts of Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,"" Tedros added ominously. As many have been saying, monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that primarily occurs in homosexuals. A version of it called clade 1b is transferred ""mainly through sexual networks,"" the WHO admitted at last week's meeting. ""Stopping these outbreaks will require a tailored and comprehensive response, with communities at the centre, as always,"" Tedros said. The WHO says it is providing special ""machines"" to African countries to analyze blood samples infected with monkeypox. The United Nations (UN) agency is also working with laboratories ""to sequence viral samples,"" Tedros said. Then there is all the money the WHO is dumping into the project.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-15-eu-vaccination-card-all-about-financial-control.html,EU vaccination card is all about FINANCIAL CONTROL,"The European Union (EU) is set to launch next month a test run of its new European Vaccination Card (EVC) for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in five countries: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Latvia and Portugal. The vaccination card is expected to be implemented throughout the entire EU by 2026. The EU prides itself as a global pioneer in the development of digital vaccine passports, and under the new project dubbed the European Vaccination Beyond COVID-19 (EUVABECO), it will initiate pilot projects to develop and test implementation plans for tools that support both routine and crisis vaccination practices. According to the project, the vaccination card purports to ""foster informed decision-making on vaccination and improve continuity of care across the European Union. It also claims to ""empower individuals by consolidating all their vaccination data in one easily accessible location."" But the real reason for the development of this new system was reportedly due to the apparent lack of preparedness for the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite decades of awareness of the ""significant threat to the world"" posed by zoonotic diseases. And so, the new project allegedly focused on innovation leading to the rapid deployment of multidisciplinary approaches and new technologies to help authorities understand, treat and protect against the virus. These innovations included new medicinal products, such as vaccines and advanced tools like those for modeling and forecasting. The objectives of the program appear benign, however. Critics argue that the push is paving the way to mandatory vaccinations soon, overruling constitutional rights, and possible plans to manipulate personal financial control and even national sovereignty. During a recent ""Defender In-Depth"" episode on the Children's Health Defense , Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst said she saw big similarities between the EVC and the European Commission's Digital COVID Certificate, the global push toward digital ID as well as possible implications for health and medical freedom. For her, this push is really ""about digital ID."" (Related: Just like the deadly mRNA jab, the new DIGITAL I.D. is not ""mandatory"" yet, but it will seem that way very soon .) ""You get a digital ID where all your vaccination records are stored… All your personal details are stored in one place, and you can move it easily from one country to another without having to redo or reapply,"" she said. ""So basically, it's about a digital ID, and then a link from your personal ID to your medical records on vaccination."" She added that this contravenes the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which in Chapter 1, Article 3 (""Right to the integrity of the person"") encapsulates the key tenets of the Nuremberg Declaration. This includes a requirement for ""the free and informed consent of the person concerned"" about medical procedures and ""the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain."" The EVC and the digital vaccination certificate were presented as different programs but both are really based on ""the same software,"" she added. ""They've been working on it for years and years and years. And it works perfectly, and it's all linked together like the banking infrastructure, the personal medical records, insurance, everything links into each other,"" Terhorst said, adding that the EU is trying to become a federal state that can issue a passport to all its citizens. EVC is part of public health rhetoric that actually aims to promote interests of central banks Elsewhere in the podcast, Terhorst said ""prominent financial interests"" are behind the public health rhetoric promoting initiatives such as the EVC. She cited Catherine Austin Fitts, founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the U.S., who told The Defender that the EVC represents ""another step toward asserting control of labor and travel, with a goal to controlling resources and assets."" According to Fitts, central bankers are hiding behind health policies, like lockdowns, to manage inflation and resource demand when monetary policy is highly inflationary. ""The ultimate goal is financial control and no legitimate public health purpose,"" Fitts noted. ""So basically, and this is I think very important for everybody to realize, it's not about health, it's about your money,"" Terhorst said. ""They want to make you into a kind of minion as somebody who's not having real rights."" Head over to Tyranny.news for more stories related to government control and overreach.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-planned-parenthoods-organ-trafficking-video-suppressed-by-kamala.html,Planned Parenthood’s grisly organ-trafficking operations revealed in video previously SUPPRESSED by then-Attorney General Kamala Harris,"Newly-released footage from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) sheds light on the grisly, callous mass murder that is taking place at Planned Parenthood facilities across the nation. Babies up to six months old are being strategically killed, their organs harvested, their limbs dismembered, their tissues picked apart and trafficked. For eight years, Planned Parenthood fought to suppress this footage, but its release has finally brought light to the horrifying reality of how abortion providers handle the limbs and organs of aborted babies. The moral and ethical failings within the abortion industry are heard in the voices of the calloused providers, who talk frivolously about the tissues and organs of the babies they just killed and picked apart. Investigation finds Planned Parenthood providers strategically picking apart baby’s organs, limbs, tissues The latest undercover video is part of CMP’s 2015 investigation , which revealed a chilling string of transactions that featured abortion providers’ cold disregard for human life. During a National Abortion Federation (NAF) trade show, officials from Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Texas, including Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ann Schutt-Aine and Vice President Tram Nguyen, RN, were recorded discussing their methods with undercover CMP journalists who posed as laboratory wholesalers. Their conversations highlight a disturbing level of detachment and insensitivity toward the victims of their procedures. One of the most unsettling revelations from the footage is Dr. Schutt-Aine's admission of using additional “passes” during abortions to avoid classification as a partial-birth abortion (PBA). This procedure was banned under federal law in 2003. Schutt-Aine describes using forceps to pull off a baby’s limbs to prevent the procedure from being categorized as PBA, revealing a deliberate attempt to circumvent legal restrictions. This practice not only reflects a profound disregard for the law but also a chilling level of cruelty toward the unborn . The video also captures Tram Nguyen making light of the grisly nature of their work, joking about having a “leg” available for sale and expressing concern that others might view their actions as “evil.” This casual treatment of such a serious matter speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy within the organization. It illustrates a broader issue: the dehumanization of the unborn and the exploitation of their bodies for profit. Then-Attorney General Kamala Harris tried to suppress these gut-wrenching revelations and prosecuted the whistleblowers In the wake of these revelations, CMP founder David Daleiden highlighted Planned Parenthood’s disturbing pattern of denial and suppression . Despite Planned Parenthood’s repeated claims of rebuffing any opportunities to sell fetal body parts, the footage shows a clear eagerness to profit from the sale of these organs. The documentation of Planned Parenthood’s willingness to dissect and sell the remains of aborted babies, including selling liver-thymus pairs for $1,600, underscores a grotesque commercialization of human life. Now, Daleiden and other whistleblowers are calling on Congress to investigate then-Attorney General Kamala Harris who ordered the videos taken down and for Daleiden to be arrested. The attempts to suppress this footage, including actions taken by Kamala Harris, add another layer of controversy to an issue with serious ethical implications. As she takes the mantle of the Democrat nominee for President in 2024, Harris should be facing an indictment for covering up Planned Parenthood’s criminal misconduct and for persecuting whistleblowers who brought the legal and ethical violations to light. Instead of addressing the crimes exposed by the footage in 2015, Harris's office seized the video and prosecuted Daleiden for daring to share the truth of the matter. This action, coupled with discovered communications between Harris’s office and Planned Parenthood, suggests a troubling complicity in covering up these brutal and inhumane practices . The release of this footage should serve as a wake-up call for everyone concerned with ethical standards and human dignity. It is imperative that these revelations lead to a broader examination of abortion practices and the systems that enable such egregious conduct. The lack of legal consequences for the implicated individuals reveals the overwhelming presence of a powerful organ trafficking industry that runs afoul of the American judicial system. As this scandal unfolds, it is crucial for lawmakers, the public, and advocacy groups to confront the implications of these practices and demand an end to organ trafficking of unborn babies . The ethical and legal violations depicted in the video represent a grave assault on the sanctity of human life and put a target on the backs of vulnerable women who are coerced to believe they are incapable of supporting life and would be better off surrendering their child to this grisly organ trafficking industry.

An Australian woman shared a video clip of one of them – watch below – explaining how the food industry put him in their crosshairs for merely instructing his diabetic patients to reduce their sugar intake and instead consume more eggs, cheese and full-fat yogurt. ""I was targeted by the food industry here in Australia,"" the doctor in the video below explains, noting that he has evidence in the form of digital communications that Big Food wants physicians like himself to be stopped from helping diabetics overcome their illness. ""We've got their internal emails saying these seven people are to be targeted. So I was reported to the medical board on three occasions for giving the advice to start reducing sugar."" “I was targeted - I was reported the medical 3 times” Australian Doctor in trouble for fixing patients diabetes. This is insane - it’s almost like they want you sick. pic.twitter.com/EtgMkKJGSp — Concerned Citizen (@BGatesIsaPyscho) August 8, 2024 (Related: Did you know that get injected with insulin increases the risk of death twofold in type 2 diabetics?) Medical establishment feeds diabetics loads of sugar The same doctor says he was reported on one occasion for ""inappropriately"" reversing someone's diabetes on television. ""We're not allowed to do that – and certainly not on national TV when we did it,"" the doctor explains. ""I honestly thought this was a joke when I started getting reported because I'm personally seeing the benefits for myself, my team, my family, my patients."" Upon observing diabetics being admitted to the hospital with foot complications only to be served ice cream three times a day, the doctor told hospital staff to stop doing this. ""Let's reduce the sugar,"" he told the staff. ""I was really radical, I said, 'I prescribe eggs and cheese and full-fat yogurt."" ""I'd have to write on the medication chart that I wanted my patient prescribed eggs and cheese because the hospitals wouldn't do it."" This same doctor was accused of imposing a ""horrendously dangerous intervention"" on diabetics with this protocol, as if telling them to eat less sugar and more fat and protein is somehow a threat to their health. It turns out that it was just the diet they needed to start healing. ""He seems like a hero to me,"" the woman in the video concludes about the doctor's sensible protocol for diabetes. Someone on X responded to the video by claiming that he helped cure his neighbor's type 2 diabetes by suggesting that she put two drops of Lugol's iodine in her morning juice every day. In just a few short months, the neighbor's doctor stopped all her diabetes medications because she no longer needed them. ""There is no money in curing the patients,"" wrote another about why Big Food and the medical establishment are opposed to natural remedies for diabetes. ""This is what it boils down to."" ""The doctors are about making money with shots and pills forever, not helping people."" Another suggested that diabetics spend more time exercising at the gym, which directly benefits the pancreas by reducing blood sugar levels. ""Do weights – it's helped me,"" this person wrote. ""There is also now an extra benefit in reducing dementia risk – muscle power is key. And vitamin D is very good, too."" Someone else says he lost weight by eating eggs, parmesan, kefir, fruit and three liters of water per day. ""I lost a lot of weight even though I'm fit.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-who-as-big-pharma-profit-propaganda-pusher.html,WHO functions as Big Pharma’s profit maker and propaganda pusher,"Big Pharma has been working with the World Health Organization to reorganize the drug market in a way that reduces regulatory barriers to forcing populations to undergo health interventions any time the WHO sees fit to declare a pandemic. Journalist Max Jones recently investigated the new strategy, which will help the pharmaceutical industry protect its profits as a number of its top-selling drugs are poised to lose their patent protection in the coming years. With as much as $180 billion in sales at stake, they’re scrambling to find a new source of revenue – and biologics could be their meal ticket if they can get the regulatory pieces in place to support them. The WHO’s revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR) are set up with this goal in mind. When you consider the fact that WHO gets 80% of its funding from private stakeholders, it makes perfect sense that they’d be so willing to support them. There are four main components to the plan for Big Pharma to secure the emerging pandemic market with help from the WHO and its recently passed amendments to the IHR and its proposed pandemic treaty. Biosurveillance of “pathogens with pandemic potential” The World Health Organization has already started to call on its member states to set up infrastructure for carrying out biosurveillance on their populations, with private WHO stakeholders like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation already funding these initiatives. Facilitating the sharing of research and data The IHR amendments dictate that the director general of the World Health Organization will support countries in their research and development and facilitate data sharing during a pandemic, which could help to coordinate responses to outbreaks and methods of prevention. This, Jones points out, also means working together to share data about diseases that they claim are “likely to cause epidemics on the future” – which could really be anything if they deem it convenient and profitable. Indeed, the same global organizations that are working with the WHO will likely do this research and develop associated vaccines and then profit from them. Developing new regulatory mechanisms The World Health Organization is also seeking ways to make it easier for unapproved medical products to hit the market during a so-called emergency or pandemic, much like what happened with the experimental COVID-19 vaccines. There is also a provision in the proposed treaty to ensure member countries have “legal, administrative and financial frameworks in place to support emergency regulatory authorizations for the effective and timely approval of pandemic-related health products during a pandemic.” Paving the way for worldwide mandates of unapproved products Finally, the Big Pharma – WHO plan seeks to establish a system that will allow for unapproved products to be mandated around the world. This could function in a similar manner to the vaccine passports adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic that may not have been absolute requirements but served to exclude people and restrict their freedoms for not complying with vaccine mandates. It’s worth remembering that the WHO is also working on its Global Digital Health Certification Network to digitize people’s health and vaccine records. “Verification systems of this size will place the right of citizens to do basic activities — like traveling, eating at a restaurant or working their job — in the hands of governments and potentially employers,” Jones warned. “The rights of civilians will be conditional, dictated by data stored in a massive digital hub that is global in its sharing abilities. Not only will domestic governments have access to the health information of their own citizens under this system, but an entire global bureaucracy will as well,” he added. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-psychology-of-covid-mask-wearing-democrats-liberals.html,The twisted psychology of Covid mask-wearing and why so many Democrats and Liberals STILL wear them everywhere they go,"The proof is everywhere you turn and look. You will see these folks alone, in their car, wearing their Covid mask. You can witness these sheeple jogging down the sidewalk, alone, wearing their Fauci Flu face diaper. These mysophobia clones believed every single word that came out of Fauci’s mouth, because he is a “disease expert.” Follow the science, as they say. Do everything the Centers for Disease Continuation instructs you to do, after all, that’s the U.S. government talking. Wear your mask. Social distance. Shelter in place. Wash hands with antibacterial stuff every time you touch anything, well, except your mask, which you can adjust a thousand times a day and it always remains germ free. Right? Top 10 reasons most Democrats and Liberals are still wearing their Covid mask everywhere they go Impaired cognition (mask works in tandem with the clot shots ) They think it works Mysophobia - Germ and disease paranoia induced by fake news (anxiety levels running high) Low self-esteem (very important for the communist regime in power to keep everyone feeling horrible about themselves) Self-harm and sabotage (stems from chronic low self-opinion) Dampens critical thinking (vicious cycle of stupidity) - the mask keeps them from thinking about the reason they feel horrible most of the time is DUE to the mask Fake science has them conned - they won't find the real science on mask wearing and they won't believe anyone who advises them about it Good for criminal behavior, like rioting, stealing, avoiding facial recognition They like being a clone (and they feel obliged to conform) It fits the communist manifesto (method of operation) to have no face, no unique or authentic personality. Mask wearers regularly experience oxygen deprivation up to 20%, leading to impaired cognition, anxiety, periodic panic attacks It’s called oxygen deprivation mask syndrome (ODMS), and mountains of scientific evidence proves it’s real. For example, research conducted in 2021 revealed that “prolonged use of Covid masks, either homemade or N95, can cause anywhere from five to 20 percent loss of oxygen to the body, leading to hypoxia as well as hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream).” Hypoxia can also affect fetal and embryonic development, so pregnant women are a highly vulnerable group for ODMS. Of course, the Covid Industrial Complex was NOT going to let mass media share this vital study with the brainwashed populace. Prolonged mask-wearing can have life-threatening health effects, so why do so many Democrats and Liberals love to wear their Covid face diapers 24/7/365? There’s a simple explanation. Because they are the Branch Covidians who believe wholeheartedly that it will save them from sure doom. Fake news from their beloved mass media complex, weaponized social media and the insidious 3-letter government organizations, including the CDC, FDA and WHO have them completely brainwashed. Nearly everyone who believes in the fake news on TV and in the newspapers suffers a perpetually heightened state of germophobia, also known as mysophobia. This interferes with their daily lives, as they now have much difficulty distinguishing between a minor risk of exposure and a serious threat, so they experience panic and anxiety when they so much as think about germs. This can be accompanied by shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, disorientation, nausea, feelings of dread, and panic attacks. Beware of the Covid mask freaks. They can flip out at any given moment. Also, thanks to mRNA clot shots , these chronic mask-wearers are burning the health “candle” at both ends. In other words, a lack of proper blood circulation increases anxiety, depression and the risk of developing schizophrenia. The clot shots are clogging their blood vessels, while the face diapers slowly choke out their oxygen supply. Get ready for the Bird Flu mask lovers to make matters even worse. Tune your internet dial to NaturalMedicine.news for ways to maintain proper oxygen, nutrient, and blood flow by using natural remedies and indigenous cures that have been around for thousands of years.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-nhs-data-200k-brits-awaiting-autism-assessment.html,"NHS data: Nearly 200,000 Brits currently awaiting autism assessment – 30,000 more than the previous year","New data from the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) reveals that a record number of British citizens are seeking autism assessment, with nearly 200,000 currently on the waiting list – 30,000 more than the previous year . This figure marks a 22 percent rise from last year and is nine times higher than in 2019. The surge has created significant delays, with 90 percent of people waiting beyond the recommended 13 weeks. Notably, two-thirds of those awaiting assessment are children under 17 years old. Experts are condemning the British health care system as ""broken"" and urging for immediate reform to prevent missing out on critical early support. National Autistic Society Head of Policy Mel Merritt pointed out that the lengthy waits mean many are missing out on essential assistance. In April, it was revealed that children across the U.K. could wait up to four years for an autism diagnosis. Merritt stressed the need to address the diagnostic delays to restore NHS effectiveness and support people in need. Autism, a developmental condition, means the brain functions differently from birth although it may only be recognized in childhood or later. Understanding the surge in autism diagnoses Experts remain divided on whether the surge in autism diagnoses reflects overdiagnosis or a genuine increase in cases . A study reported by The Guardian reveals that some NHS centers in the U.K. diagnose autism in adults at twice the rate of others. Autism diagnoses have dramatically risen over the past decades. A 2021 study published by the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, revealed a staggering 787 percent increase in U.K. diagnoses from 1998 to 2018 . Autism only affected one in 2,500 children 80 years ago. Today, it is estimated to affect one in 36. This rise can be partly attributed to better understanding, heightened awareness and more professionals becoming qualified to diagnose the condition referred to as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a result, the criteria for diagnosing autism has expanded drastically, bringing in individuals who might not have been previously considered as being within the spectrum, particularly girls and women. The reasons behind the increase in autism diagnoses remain a topic of debate, with experts and those in the neurodiversity movement unsure whether this rise is due to overdiagnosis or if more children genuinely have ASD. The neurodiversity movement encourages people to see neurological differences, like autism, as natural variations instead of disorders or problems. This movement has played a big role in changing how autism is understood and diagnosed – pushing for more recognition of different ways people's brains work. The term ""neurodiversity"" was first used in the 1990s to help reduce the stigma faced by people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and learning disabilities like dyslexia. Since then, it has grown into a movement that supports those who think and learn differently – focusing on their strengths and talents, instead of the challenges, particularly in their social environment. Study author Dr. Ginny Russell, Mental Health and Development Disorders senior research fellow at the University of Exeter , said the criteria for diagnosing autism may continue to expand, believing that this expansion could eventually lead to almost everyone being categorized as ""neurodiverse."" Russell pointed out that while there might be a slightly higher number of children with mild autistic traits, there is no strong evidence to support a significant increase in ASD cases . According to Russell, the rise in diagnoses is largely due to expanding assessment criteria that continue to include more people. The study author added that as the definition of autism broadens, it might eventually include individuals like herself who have some ""borderline traits."" Are autism and ADHD being over-diagnosed?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-study-ergothioneine-mushrooms-help-extend-lifespan.html,Study suggests ergothioneine in mushrooms can help extend your lifespan,"Mushrooms are a great addition to many savory dishes. Research suggests the benefits offered by mushrooms go beyond the kitchen . Several studies have found that a compound in mushrooms can help extend the human lifespan. One recent study looked into the potential benefits of fungi-derived bioactive compounds on lifespan and health span. The study also highlighted the importance of finding interventions to minimize age-related diseases. Another study published in the Nutrition Journal investigated the health benefits of mushrooms. Researchers found that mushroom consumption is linked to a longer lifespan. They credited this benefit to mushrooms' high content of ergothioneine, an antioxidant amino acid found in fungi and bacteria. While conducting the study, researchers reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The 20-year prospective cohort study involved 15,000 participants. Results revealed that the people who included mushrooms in their diet had a 16 percent lower chance of early death. The researchers also discovered that consuming one serving of mushrooms per day instead of processed meat reduced the chances of dying prematurely from any cause by at least 35 percent. The research team explained that this benefit may be due to ergothioneine's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. They also suggested that ergothioneine's anti-aging properties could stem from its ability to protect against telomere shortening. Research shows ergothioneine has protective effects on telomeres Telomeres are usually described as protective ""caps"" for chromosomes. These long strings of delicate, elaborately folded DNA act like the protective plastic tips on shoelaces that help prevent fraying and damage. Longer telomeres are associated with better cellular health and are also usually linked with longevity. But telomeres naturally shorten over time, which makes them less able to preserve the structure of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are linked with aging and chronic degenerative disease. In a study with participants over 60, those with shorter telomeres were three times more likely to die of heart disease than those with longer telomeres. They were also at least eight times more likely to die from infections. In another preliminary study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements in 2022, a research team discovered that treating cells with ergothioneine for eight weeks alleviated telomere shortening from oxidative stress. They suggested that this can help potentially avoid mutations in DNA that could cause cancer . The researchers concluded that the results support ""a potential role for ergothioneine in oxidative stress-related conditions and healthy aging."" Ergothioneine also supports longevity by helping to replenish and recycle glutathione, the body’s master antioxidant. Data also suggests that ergothioneine offers a valuable ""trifecta"" of anti-aging gifts: supporting longer telomeres, protecting DNA and recycling glutathione. Mushrooms can support optimal brain health In a separate study, scientists found that people over 60 were found to display lower levels of ergothioneine. They added that those over 60 with mild age-related cognitive impairment showed even sharper declines in this important amino acid. This is bad because ergothioneine, which helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress, is believed to help aging adults maintain healthy cognition and memory. Test tube and animal studies have indicated that ergothioneine may also help support memory by creating new neurons or brain cells. In a trial published in the Japanese Journal of Pharmacology , the research team gave both healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment a mushroom extract containing 5 mg of ergothioneine a day for 12 weeks. They found that the supplementation resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory, working memory and sustained attention for both the healthy and the mildly impaired volunteers. (Related: 6 Mushrooms you can eat to prevent cognitive impairment and reduce your dementia risk .) Aside from its anti-aging properties, ergothioneine also helps support a healthy immune system, promotes optimal cardiovascular function and supports healthy skin. Ergothioneine is even used in skincare serums and creams to reduce the appearance of fine lines and soothe redness and irritation. It is also used in products that help fight against damage and photoaging caused by ultraviolet radiation. Visit NaturalMedicine.news for more research about mushrooms and other superfoods.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-covid-mrna-vaccine-recipients-heart-failure-risk.html,"COVID mRNA jab recipients suffer 4,900% increased risk of heart failure, Japanese researchers discover","Japan's leading pharmaceutical scientists are in agreement that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" massively increase recipients' risk of suffering heart failure. Published in the Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy , a paper they published unpacks the disturbing reality that getting jabbed for COVID with an mRNA (modRNA) injection increases one's risk of heart failure by an astounding 4,900 percent. Led by Prof. Keisuke Takada, the team from the Division of Pharmacodynamics at Keio University 's Faculty of Pharmacy and Yokohama General Hospital further found the risk of developing myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation, increases up to 50-fold after getting injected with mRNA COVID shots. Using data collected from the Japanese government's vaccine adverse event reporting system, called JADER (Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report) – JADER is similar to VAERS here in the United States – covering April 2004 through December 2023, the team calculated both reporting odds ratios (RORs) and 95 percent confidence intervals as part of their investigation. Myocarditis and its sister disease pericarditis are known side effects of COVID injections. They restrict the ability of the heart to pump blood properly, often leading to clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and, in many cases, sudden and unexpected death. (Related: Other Japanese researchers are calling for the donor blood supply to be cleansed of mRNA-tainted supplies.) Why get injected in the first place? In Japan, about 80 percent of the country's population of 125.1 million people got ""vaccinated"" for the Chinese Virus. This is greater than the percentage here in the U.S., suggesting that Japanese people were even more trusting (or coerced) than Americans into getting the shot(s). The period from vaccination to onset in the study was less than or equal to eight days, meaning most adverse events from mRNA injections occur within the first week post-injection. Most of the cases, 78 percent and 87 percent respectively, identified involved recovery or remission, meaning the patients were able to get mostly, or at least somewhat, back to how they were pre-injections. Some of the cases resulted in sudden death, though. In 11 percent and eight percent of cases respectively, there was a ""severe outcome"" involving myocarditis or pericarditis. Of these, 11 percent and five percent, respectively, resulted in sudden death. The paper adds to a growing mountain of evidence showing that COVID shots are extremely dangerous, especially compared to all other vaccines currently on the market. A disturbingly high number of recipients end up getting sick or dying from the shots, despite the government's claims of ""safe and effective."" In Singapore, a highly obedient country where nearly all residents got jabbed for COVID, there is a health crisis emerging as those who took the clot shots are increasingly displaying serious health problems years after the fact. In the video below, Miles Guo explains in further detail how the spike proteins in the shots lead to heart problems. Guo also reveals that the contents of any vaccine injection remain in the body for life: MilesGuo : One dose of vaccine contains 40 trillion spike proteins that could cause myocarditis, myocardial infarction, Cerebral infarction, and cerebrovascular infarction. Any so-called vaccine injected will remain in the body forever. pic.twitter.com/czWxmSaWK2 — Bryne? (@riss1130) August 11, 2024 ""This is going to be an extinction level event if we don't think of some way to neutral [sic] the mRNA spike protein,"" someone wrote on X about the health crisis. ""And they are still giving this to people!"" ""The sensible among us saw this happening and kept our children away from this poison,"" wrote another. Another clarified that mRNA should actually read modRNA, which means modified RNA and genetic manipulation. Getting jabbed for COVID is many people's biggest life regret.

Walz faces intensive and renewed criticism for his COVID-19 policies as Minnesota governor This is not the first time Walz has faced criticism since Harris named him as her running mate. Earlier this August, Walz's controversial ""Kids Deserve a Shot"" vaccine incentive program from January 2022 reemerged and got the public's attention. The program, specifically for all children ages five to 11, offered $200 Visa gift cards to all Minnesota families who would get their kids fully vaccinated with COVID-19 in January and February. The program also included a vaccine lottery wherein Minnesota families who got their kids ages five to 11 vaccinated at that time were eligible to participate in a lottery for a $100,000 college scholarship. And just like the ""snitch line,"" the incentive program also faced intensive and renewed criticism from various quarters. ""Tim Walz poisoned low-income families who desperately needed money and gave their children, who had zero risk of Covid, an experimental vaccine,"" Prominent commentator Mike Cernovich posted on X. ""This is an evil man."" Similarly, Dr. Mary Talley Bowden accused Walz of bribing families to administer potentially dangerous substances to their children. The libertarian organization Being Libertarian also criticized the program: ""Tim Walz bribed parents to inject their children with dangerous, experimental, unnecessary chemicals for $200."" Conservative activist Laura Loomer also joined the chorus, questioning the potential health impacts on vaccinated children. ""How many kids now have myocarditis thanks to @KamalaHarris’s VP pick?""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-fauci-positive-covid-despite-being-vaccinated-6x.html,Fauci tests positive for COVID-19 a third time despite being VACCINATED 6 TIMES,"Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a third time, despite being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine six times . The former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) made this admission during a July 30 interview with Dr. Jeremy Faust, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today . ""I got infected about two weeks ago. It was my third COVID-19 infection, and I had been vaccinated and boosted a total of six times."" Fauci, who retired from public service in December 2022, nevertheless called on Americans to exercise renewed caution and return to the pandemic-era practice of wearing face coverings. ""You don't have to immobilize what you do and cut yourself off from society. But regardless of what the current recommendations are – when you're in a crowded closed space and you're an 85-year-old person with chronic lung disease or a 55-year-old person who is morbidly obese with diabetes and hypertension, then you should be wearing a mask,"" he told Faust. ""And you should be careful to avoid crowded places where you don't know the status of other people, and you should get vaccinated and boosted on a regular basis. The message is that if you are in a risk category, you have got to take this seriously."" But given the infectious disease expert's health status, his advice to ""get vaccinated and boosted"" appears to be an ineffective one. Aside from failing to prevent infection, the COVID-19 injections have also been linked to serious reactions such as cardiac inflammation and neurological disorders. ""Fauci's comments come amid ongoing debates about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and mask mandates,"" YourNews remarked. ""Recent data has indicated that vaccinated individuals are contracting COVID-19 at higher rates than the unvaccinated, and they now constitute the majority of COVID-19 deaths. These findings have fueled skepticism and controversy surrounding public health measures."" (Related: Government data shows fully vaxxed account for more than 90% of COVID DEATHS in the UK. ) Fauci's call for masks appears to be another COVID-19 psy-op The outlet took notice of the 83-year-old Fauci's ""continued advocacy for wearing masks, despite the mounting evidence questioning their effectiveness."" It appears that Fauci's sudden return to the limelight is a prelude to another COVID-19 psy-op. Even the globalist World Health Organization (WHO) seems to be in on the conspiracy. Officials at the global health body said in a recent briefing that 84 countries are experiencing a surge in the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests. They warned that new waves of infection could drive mutations, warning the public that these mutations ""could potentially evade detection systems and be unresponsive to medical intervention."" ""COVID-19 infections are surging globally … and are unlikely to decline anytime soon. The [WHO] is also warning that more severe variants of the [Wuhan] coronavirus may soon be on the horizon,"" the officials warned. Given this, the global health body exhorted countries to ramp up vaccination efforts and promote annual COVID-19 injections for high-risk individuals. ""As individuals, it is important to take measures to reduce risk of infection and severe disease – including ensuring that you have had a COVID-19 vaccination dose in the last 12 months, especially if you are in an at-risk group,"" WHO COVID-19 Response Technical Lead Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted. ""I am concerned with such low coverage and with such large circulation [that] if we were to have a variant that would be more severe, then the susceptibility of the at-risk populations to develop severe disease is huge.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-california-pushing-covid-scam-high-virus-wastewater.html,California still pushing COVID-19 scam by claiming there are “very high” levels of SARS-CoV-2 in WASTEWATER,"California is still pushing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) scam five years on, this time by claiming that there are ""very high"" levels of the virus in wastewater . According to SHTF Plan , officials in the Golden State are closely watching the BA2 strain – a subvariant of the earlier B11529 omicron – that is fueling a global uptick in coronavirus cases. U.S. wastewater data has also revealed that several cities in the Bay Area like San Francisco and San Jose are grappling with ""high"" SARS-CoV-2 levels compared with other areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) appears to be in on the ruse, with the public health agency claiming that California is now the region most afflicted with COVID-19 in the U.S. alongside Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii. The CDC's testing of international travelers who voluntarily agree to have their sinuses swabbed for COVID-19 is ongoing. This COVID-19 testing scheme now includes seven major airports in the United States. But according to Scott Pauley, CDC press officer, the voluntary testing isn't good enough. He told NBC News that wastewater surveillance has shown to be a valuable tool, and that airplane wastewater surveillance could be another option. Pauley said analysis of airplane sewage could help scientists track new COVID-19 variants entering the U.S., or identify novel pathogens. (Related: Wastewater discharge into streams can lead to rapid antibiotic resistance, bacterial infections and disease. ) SHTF Plan 's Mac Slavo begged to differ, however, noting that the mainstream media (MSM) ""has pushed the 'wastewater' narrative for a long time."" He remarked that the MSM can utilize this new scheme to ""panic the masses while the ruling class takes even more power."" ""It's very strange that the West Coast continues to be high,"" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong. But for Slavo, the high levels of COVID-19 in the wastewater isn't strange. Rather, the fact that Californians continue to buy the narrative and fall for it repeatedly is something worth wondering about. California still stuck in the pandemic era while the rest of the U.S. moves on Most of the U.S. has moved on from COVID-19, with most pandemic-related policies expiring and cases remaining low across the county. Even most Americans no longer fear being infected with SARS-CoV-2, chalking it up to a mild cold. In California, nearly eight in 10 (79 percent) say the worst is behind us when it comes to COVID-19. Nevertheless, most also think it is somewhat important to control the spread – a substantial number of Californians favoring certain spaces asking for vaccine passports and prohibiting those without proof of injection. But Slavo also pointed out the absurdity of the CDC's goal of ""analyzing wastewater"" from airplanes and California's sewage system. He remarked: ""How is testing airplane wastewater going to slow the introduction of new variants into the U.S.? If it’s in the wastewater of an airplane, isn’t it already in the United States?"" Ultimately, the Golden State is continuing to try to spread fear among its citizens over COVID-19, with observers believing that its health authorities will continue this narrative as long as people are willing to get injected with COVID vaccines and boosters that are suspected of killing them or making them very sick.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-uk-doctors-instructed-ask-male-patients-pregnant.html,INSANE: British doctors now instructed to ask MEN if they are PREGNANT,"British doctors must now comply with a new absurd rule – asking men if they are pregnant – following a mandate by the U.K. National Health Service (NHS). Under the new NHS rule, physicians are required to ask men the question before they undergo X-ray procedures, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Guidance titled ""Inclusive Pregnancy Status Guidelines for Ionizing Radiation"" was released by the British Society of Radiographers in line with the NHS edict. Russia Today (RT) reported, citing the Telegraph , that the guidance followed an incident where a transgender man – a biological woman pretending to be a male – had a CT scan while pregnant. Bolstering the new instruction from the NHS was the fact that the radiation from X-ray, CT and MRI scans can be harmful to unborn babies. (Related: Pregnant women should minimize EMF exposure at all costs – unborn babies receive 20x more electromagnetic concentration. ) According to the NHS, the questioning comes in the form of an information sheet patients have to fill out. Patients between 12 and 55 years old – including biological men and gender-confused individuals such as transgender, non-binary and intersex patients – must indicate their ""sex assigned at birth"" and ""fertility status,"" RT added. Moreover, doctors have been instructed ""not to assume the gender identity of patients when performing all such procedures."" A separate report by the Evening Standard meanwhile recounted that ""some hospitals have gone further, asking patients to complete forms stating their … preferred name and pronouns. ""It was not clear from the report how many U.K. medical institutions have adopted the new guidelines, but a number of hospitals in London and other cities were reported to have started using the new inquiry forms,"" RT continued. New NHS policy met with OUTRAGE Several X-ray specialists who spoke to the Telegraph on condition of anonymity said patients have deemed some of the questions ""invasive."" Several doctors also reported men reacting angrily to the new guidance, storming out of appointments over the insinuation that their gender wasn't obvious. One instance involved a patient on an urgent cancer pathway abandoning an appointment in anger. In another instance, a patient requiring daily scans for a week began to doubt his identity after repeated questioning. Worse, some parents of underage patients have been ""furious"" over these intrusive and confusing questions to their children. But some doctors and human rights campaigners have spoken out against the guidelines, calling them ""humiliating"" to patients. They have already appealed to the NHS to drop the guidance and ""return to common sense."" ""Given that it is impossible for anyone of the male sex to become pregnant, there is no need to ask male people if they might be pregnant,"" said Dr. Louise Irvine of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender. ""The proposed radiography guidelines muddy the water by including so-called intersex conditions."" Fiona McAnena, head of campaigns at the human rights charity Sex Matters, slammed the NHS policy as among the worst examples of prioritizing ideology ahead of biological fact. ""Putting healthcare staff and male patients through this humiliating farce … is both inappropriate and a shocking waste of time,"" she said. Head over to Gender.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-zeynep-tufekci-is-a-master-at-flimflam.html,Emails show Zeynep Tufekci is a master at flimflam,"Hey guys, I had a piece last week in UnHerd discussing hundreds of emails I had gone through that found social media influencer Zeynep Tufekci pressured the prestigious medical nonprofit Cochrane to put out a statement attacking their own review that found there is little evidence that masks stop respiratory viruses. One of the people Tufekci interviewed for the piece also told me that she twisted his words, which is obvious from the emails. (Article by Paul D. Thacker republished from DisinformationChronicle.Substack.com ) I want to walk you through some of those emails, but if you’d like to read the piece in UnHerd, it’s here: How the NYT undermined mask evidence: Leaked emails reveal how scientists were smeared . The emails were sent to me after someone had filed Freedom of Information requests at different universities, and I got others from a person at Cochrane who is upset at what is happening inside the organization. Let’s first set the stage for what happened. Mask activist on the attack In March 2023, New York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote an essay arguing that “masks work” while attacking a review on masks by Cochrane, which publishes the gold standard of evidence for medical interventions. When Tufekci’s piece first appeared, I knew it smelled fishy. Just a month prior, I had published a long Q&A with Tom Jefferson , the lead author of the Cochrane 2023 mask review . Jefferson loves going into all kinds of details about the hierarchy of evidence, how reviews are done, the contrasts between different types of reviews, and other tiny bits of medical information that only interest people with decades of expertise in clinical trials and medical research. In short, very hard to follow. My interest in masks was to help readers cut through all the controversy, to understand whether they really help with COVID and if mask mandates make sense in their schools and local community. I had noticed videos and news stories circulating on social media pointing out that several public health officials had done a 180 from the early months of the pandemic, first stating that masks don’t work, before pivoting to advocate for masks. I called this the “ great mask-science flip flop of 2020 ” and participants included Canada’s chief health officer, Theresa Tam, as well as the leading public health official in England, Jenny Harries. Even Tony Fauci performed a mask-science flip flop, first arguing that masks didn’t work, before pivoting into full-on mask activist. As Jefferson kept rambling on with tiny details about how to perform medical reviews that nobody but an expert in medical reviews could really follow, I stopped him. “Wait, did you just say that Cochrane has done this mask review several times?” I asked. “This isn’t the first one?” “Yes,” he replied. So we went down the list. The Cochrane mask review published in February 2023 wasn’t the first time Cochrane scientists had examined the scientific literature to see if there was any evidence masks worked to stop viruses. They had published prior updates finding the same thing in 2020 , 2011 2010 , 2009 , and 2007 . So the whole thing started 17 years ago. Every time Cochrane has put out a review that looked at masks, nobody said anything, because masking wasn’t controversial. Everyone agreed that masks didn’t seem to stop viruses. Physicians had first started using masks over a hundred years ago but that was to stop spreading bacteria during surgery. And bacteria are hundreds of times larger than viruses. I then started digging around and found several scientific studies concluding masks don’t do much to stop respiratory viruses, as well as several examples of international medical bodies drawing similar conclusions. For example, the World Health Organizations stated in their 2019 pandemic preparedness plan, “There have been a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and face masks have, at best, a small effect on influenza transmission.” So why was I reading a “masks work” essay in the New York Times? The only explanation is Zeynep Tufekci. I didn’t really know Tufekci until I read her “masks work” essay last year, and when I looked into her background I found that she was mostly unknown in the scientific world until COVID. Once the pandemic started she made a name for herself writing essays in places like Wired and Scientific American. Intrigued, I looked into her academic publishing record and found that her academic CV was a tad barren, with few peer-reviewed studies but a slew of opinion articles. Plus, Tufecki has no training in medicine or public health. I then discovered that her profile had exploded in March 2020 when a New York Times media reporter praised Tufekci for a March 1 tweetstorm and March 17 essay in The New York Times that swayed the CDC to alter federal guidance and begin advising people to mask. As I read the article praising Tufekci, I started laughing at how crazy it was that national policy could be set by tweets and an essay, not anything published by scientists. It was just so bizarre. Tufekci has bounced around to different universities in the past four years, but at the beginning of the pandemic, she was a professor at the University of North Carolina. North Carolina’s big paper is the Raleigh News & Observer , and I found that they profiled Tufekci in 2021, anointing her a COVID hero who had challenged top health officials and got the facts right — but with essays, not science. Instead of conducting lab experiments related to Covid-19, she used her platform on Twitter and in the opinion sections of Scientific American, The Atlantic and The New York Times to inform the public with practical advice about what to do and why. I read that newspaper article thinking, “Thank God Tufekci didn’t use her platform on Twitter to challenge airline pilots at Raleigh-Durham International that she could fly a 747 to London’s Heathrow.” And then I got the emails. Opinions mean nothing, emails and documents everything One of the first things I noticed was that Tufecki had emailed Michael Brown, a physician at Michigan State University , on February 24, 2023. According to other emails, I learned that Michael Brown had been the sign off editor for the mask review. Why, I wondered, had Tufekci contacted Brown at this time? Searching the news, I realized that Tufekci’s New York Times colleague, Bret Stephens, had published an essay three days prior, ribbing mask advocates like Tufekci because of Cochrane’s mask review: “ The Mask Mandates Did Nothing. Will Any Lessons Be Learned? ” Tufekci’s rise in prominence is based mostly on her mask advocacy, and the thrust of Stephens’ piece in the New York Times must have cut her open like a surgeon’s scalpel: [W]hen it comes to the population -level benefits of masking, the verdict is in: Mask mandates were a bust. Those skeptics who were furiously mocked as cranks and occasionally censored as “misinformers” for opposing mandates were right. The mainstream experts and pundits who supported mandates were wrong. Without much of a scientific publishing record and so much of her credibility tied to her mask advocacy, Stephens’ essay must have felt threatening. But when she contacted Brown, Tufekci laid it on thick that she was an academic researcher, claiming expertise in statistics and causal inference, as well as scientific reviews. “I use and participate in reviews myself (I’m writing one in my own field soon) and thus am familiar with many of the challenges and issues.” You don’t need to have attended university to know that Tufekci is fibbing here. I glanced through Google Scholar to see what Tufeckci has published in the academic literature and didn’t find much except opinion pieces. In all of 2024, Tufecki has not published a single article in the scientific literature, and in 2023, she published one piece: an opinion essay. As for the review Tufeckis told Brown in March 2023 that she was writing “in my own field soon”? It has never appeared. When I contacted Brown about Tufekci, he told me that he had been a bit naive perhaps in dealing with her, as he hadn’t looked into her background, and didn’t realize that she was a mask activist. But what Tufecki did with the quotes she took from Brown is quite disturbing. In her article, Tufekci quoted Brown and followed up in the next paragraph implying that he supported the idea that “the evidence is really straightforward” that masks provide protection from COVID. But Brown told me that’s not what the science concludes. Here’s the section of Tufekci’s essay: Brown, who led the Cochrane review’s approval process, told me that mask mandates may not be tenable now, but he has a starkly different feeling about their effects in the first year of a pandemic. “Mask mandates, social distancing, the other shutdowns we had in terms of even restaurants and things like that — if places like New York City didn’t do that, the number of deaths would have been much higher,” he told me. “I’m very confident of that statement.” So the evidence is relatively straightforward: Consistently wearing a mask, preferably a high-quality, well-fitting one, provides protection against the coronavirus. This is just sleazy. When I contacted Brown, he said that Tufecki spun his words, because the evidence is clear that masks don’t seem to do much. Brown actually stated as much some months after Tufekci interviewed him. Emailing the organizer of a talk he was giving, Brown wrote that masks “likely” provide “some” protection but “do not make a major impact at the community level when promoted as a public health intervention.” This is basically the opposite of how Tufekci framed Brown’s quote in her essay. Brown also told me that he had told Tufekci to contact the scientists who wrote the Cochrane review, because they are the real experts. Duh! While he was the editor of the review, he hadn’t read each and every published study like the review authors. But Tufekci ignored Brown. Instead, Tufekci contacted Karla Soares-Weiser, the woman running Cochrane. Apparently, Tufekci sent a slew of questions, because Soares-Weiser then emailed Lisa Bero , a professor medicine at the University of Colorado who serves as Cochrane ethics advisor. “Lisa, I have been back and forth with NYT about the mask review. CAN I GET YOUR VIEWS ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS?” emailed Soares-Weiser . She then sent questions to Bero that she had gotten from Tufekci. What makes this all comical is that Tufekci obviously knows nothing about reviews, yet Soares-Weiser freaked out because Tufekci writes a column at the New York Times. It’s science by essay writer. After Bero answered the questions, Soares-Weiser thanked her . “Thank you, Lisa. I'm navigating a difficult situation and of course need to take these points into account. Help appreciated.” For anyone with a passing familiarity with scientific research, one thought should come immediately to mind: why didn’t Soares-Weiser tell Tufekci to send those questions to scientists who had written the review? That’s what Michael Brown did. That will become clear in a bit. I got a copy of the email Tufekci sent Jefferson for questions and it’s dated March 9, the day before she published her 2000+ word essay. I’ve written for the New York Times. It’s a rather laborious process dealing with editors and fact checkers. It would impossible for Tufekci to contact Jefferson for comment and then slam out a 2000+ word essay, get that essay edited, deal with those edits, and then get it fact checked. What those dates tell you is that Tufekci had the essay ready to publish before she contacted Jefferson for comment, suggesting she didn’t even care what he had to say. Jefferson has been publishing scientific research on respiratory virus for several decades, but Tufekci wasn’t interested in what he had to say because she already considered herself the expert. The day Tufecki published her essay, Soares-Weiser then rushed out a statement claiming she was working to fix problems in the Cochrane mask review. But Soares-Weiser did this without consulting the scientists who had done the work. This would be like the editor-in-chief of the New York Times publishing an essay complaining about a New York Times investigative series without bothering to consult any of the reporters or editors who had done the work. “I will not speak for the others but am deeply distressed by this course of events which have occurred without our knowledge,” replied Jon Conly , a professor and former head of the department of medicine at the University of Calgary. Michael Brown responded that he had spoken to Tufekci and told her that “I stood by the conclusions of the review but asked that she reach out to you, the authors, to answer some of her questions directly. She assured me that she would do so.” Of course, Tufekci did NOT reach out to the scientific authors, because she wasn’t interested in what they had to say. Brown then sent an email to Soares-Weiser and several of the Cochrane editors reminding them that changes were being considered to the mask review language, even though it was the same wording as had been used in the 2020 update. Why were changes being considered then? As Brown explained, it had nothing to do with science. “[I]t was only under intense media coverage and criticism that these revisions were suggested.” Emails find that Soares-Weiser appeared to be in a bit of panic, monitoring negative commentary about her decision to publish a statement without bothering to consult the scientists. “I had a challenging meeting with the [governing board] yesterday. I am holding on, stressed, but OK,” she emailed Lisa Bero. Bero then suggested to Soares-Weiser that Cochrane publish negative comments being submitted by outsiders criticizing the mask review. “That should be published as soon as possible (following screening for libel or profanity),” Bero emailed . “It is important for readers to know that criticism has not just come through the media, but through the formal channels that we have.” Shortly after bullying Cochrane’s Soares-Weiser to put out a statement claiming she would make changes to the mask review, Tufekci began tweeting that she had gotten the review “corrected.” However, this isn’t true. A month back, Soares-Weiser put out a correction to her prior statement, and now says that Cochrane will not make any changes to the mask review. The entire saga calls into question Zeynep Tufekci’s ethics and whether Soares-Weiser is still fit to lead Cochrane. Read more at: DisinformationChronicle.Substack.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-former-youtube-ceo-susan-wojcicki-dies-lung-cancer.html,Former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki dies at 56 of lung cancer,"Susan Wojcicki, the former CEO of YouTube who championed deplatforming and censorship as a tool of social engineering, died of lung cancer at age 56 on Friday. (Article by Chris Menahan republished from InformationLiberation.com ) From Reuters : YouTube's former chief executive and long-time Google executive Susan Wojcicki died on Saturday at the age of 56 after a two-year battle with lung cancer. ""It is with profound sadness that I share the news of Susan Wojcicki passing. My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non-small cell lung cancer,"" Dennis Troper, Wojcicki's husband, said in a Facebook post. ""Over the last two years, even as she dealt with great personal difficulties, Susan devoted herself to making the world better through her philanthropy, including supporting research for the disease that ultimately took her life,"" Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post. As alluded to above, Wojcicki's son died of a drug overdose at age 19 while at college earlier this year. From USA Today : [Marco] Troper's autopsy found high concentrations of cocaine, amphetamine, alprazolam (Xanax), a medication prescribed to manage panic and anxiety disorders, and hydroxyzine, an antihistamine used to treat allergies and anxiety, in his system, according to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office's Coroner Bureau's investigator's report. The levels of alprazolam and cocaine in Troper's blood were high enough to cause death, according to the coroner's report. Low levels of delta-9, a more abundant form of THC, were found in the college student's blood, the report shows. [...] Troper's official cause of death was ruled ""acute combined drug toxicity,"" according to the report, which also declared the overdose as ""accidental."" Authorities found illegal and prescription drugs, including Percocet and Oxycodone"" in ""abundance"" at the scene of the incident, the report says. No evidence of physical trauma was observed, the report continued. YouTube under Wojcicki championed censorship, banned the ""far right"" en masse and enacted speech codes so broad that they banned the majority of Americans from expressing their political views. She helped scams proliferate on YouTube by removing ""dislikes"" for political reasons and worked with the pro-Israel lobbying group the Anti-Defamation League to censor users globally with AI for ""anti-Semitism"" and ""hate"" (see: criticizing Israel). Her husband was also an ADL board member. As we've seen over the past year, Israel went on to commit a genocide in Gaza ( which Google helped facilitate ).

Tim Walz, who was just selected to be Kamala Harris' running mate, tried to bribe Minnesota families into ""vaccinating"" their children with the latest shots for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). In a then-Twitter post, Walz offered families who jabbed their children aged five through 11 a $200 reward, which he saw as a fitting amount to forever ruin the immune systems of little ones throughout his state. ""That's cash in your pocket for starting the year off right by protecting your child from COVID,"" Walz declared in the post, dated Jan. 11, 2022. Dubbed ""Kids Deserve a Shot,"" the program from Walz was eventually ended and the Twitter post in question removed. Perhaps Walz is embarrassed now about what he did, or maybe it's bad for he and Kamala Harris' chances of getting elected this fall? ""Minnesota families who get their child 5-11 years old fully vaccinated in January and February can get a $200 Visa gift card,"" read the official website for Kids Deserve a Shot. ""Parents / Guardians can register their 5- to 11-year-old once they have completed their two-dose series."" (Related: Tim Walz is also a radical pro-riot politician who supported the Black Lives Matter [BLM] riots that destroyed parts of the Twin Cities.) Walz also created college scholarship lottery baiting young Minnesotans into getting COVID jabbed In addition to the $200 gift card scheme, Walz also set up a taxpayer-funded lottery system offering five $100,000 scholarships to five children aged five through 11 whose parents agreed to get them injected for the Chinese virus. ""All Minnesotans 5-11 years old who completed their first and second doses at any point in time will be eligible to be entered for a chance to win a $100,000 college scholarship,"" the website for that scheme explained. As all of this was happening, Walz also set up a snitching hotline for Minnesota's COVIDiots to rat out their non-compliant neighbors for violating his stay-at-home orders. ""A hotline set up by Gov. Tim Walz's administration to monitor compliance with his 2020 stay-at-home order generated thousands of reports from Minnesotans who snitched on their neighbors for things like playing basketball in a park, walking their dogs, and throwing small parties,"" Alpha News reported. Shane Trejo of Big League Politics says Walz deserved to be put behind bars for his many crimes against humanity throughout the ""pandemic."" ""Gov. Walz deserves to be behind bars with the likes of the American Mengele Dr. Anthony Fauci for crimes against humanity for his COVID policies,"" Trejo wrote in a post on his Substack. ""Kamala Harris' choice of Gov. Walz as her Vice President ought to be interpreted as a declaration of war against the American public."" At the first Kamala Harris for president rally he attended in Philadelphia, Walz thanked Kamala for putting her trust in him as well as for ""bringing back the joy"" to the Democrat Party with her essence. Kamala repeatedly called him ""Coach Walz"" at the rally, to which he told the crowd that he used to go by ""Mr. Walz"" back when he was a high school teacher. Walz also shouted to the ""old white guys"" in the crowd, this being a reference to an internet joke about Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate. Donald Trump in a recent appearance on Fox News called Walz ""a very, very liberal man"" and ""a shocking pick"" for Kamala. ""I could not be more thrilled,"" Trump continued, the suggestion being that he is now a shoe-in thanks to Kamala's pick of Walz as her running mate.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-sovereign-nations-must-reclaim-their-food-systems.html,Sovereign nations must reclaim their food systems and decentralize nutritious food production before populations are exploited and starved to death,"Powerful international forces are clamoring to take control over the food supply. Crises, like COVID-19 lockdowns, climate change policies and carbon restriction mandates are being engineered, so these powerful forces can shape the future of the food supply and exploit the populations . Investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group are able to control the future of food by investing in food corporations, pesticide manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and agribusiness conglomerates. Populations are extremely vulnerable because the food system is being increasingly centralized, is dependent on global factors and is controlled by big money interests. In the book -- Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth -- the current issues with the food system are addressed. Sickening Profits exposes the issues with the global food system and the perpetrators behind the chronic disease epidemic Chapter one presents a critical view of how modern financial practices shape agricultural systems and food quality. It emphasizes the negative consequences for smallholder farmers, the environment and public health, arguing that the pursuit of profit by major asset management firms undermines sustainable and equitable food systems. Chapter Two emphasizes the need to challenge the current policy agenda, which prioritizes global markets and processed foods over public health. It advocates for strengthening local markets, short supply chains and agroecological farming to promote healthier diets. The chapter underscores the importance of supporting small-scale enterprises and traditional food practices to counteract the negative effects of ultra-processed foods and improve overall health outcomes. Chapter Three exposes the harmful effects of the modern food system , driven by corporate interests, and calls for substantial reforms to create a healthier and more equitable food environment. It argues for a shift away from a profit-driven model towards one that prioritizes human health and local food economies. This includes strengthening local markets, supporting small-scale organic farming and reducing reliance on processed foods. The chapter emphasizes the need for a long-term movement to transform the food system, advocating for policies that protect public health and address food insecurity without compromising nutritional quality . Chapter Four ""Toxic Contagion: Funds, Food, and Pharma,"" exposes the deep entanglement between financial capital, corporate control and global food systems. It reveals how institutional investors shape and profit from both the agrifood and pharmaceutical industries, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation, poor health and ecological harm. Chapter Five encapsulates the ongoing battle to remove toxic glyphosate and other agrochemicals; however, it’s the power of corporations that make this a dead-end battle. These corporations shape regulations, manipulate science and prioritize profits over people. The challenge is to hold these corporations accountable, to get their toxic products removed from the food supply. In Chapter Six we’re reminded of the persistent patterns of corporate influence, deceptive marketing and environmental degradation that reflect a need for a shift in how we approach agriculture and food systems. While companies like Union Carbide have promoted their technologies as solutions, the reality often reveals significant risks and failures. Embracing sustainable practices and respecting local knowledge can offer a more viable path forward for food security and environmental health abroad. In Chapter Seven the issue of GMOs is addressed. The assertion that GMOs are essential for feeding the world overlooks the complex realities of global food systems and agricultural practices. The focus should be on addressing food distribution inequities, supporting sustainable farming practices and ensuring that policy decisions prioritize the needs of farmers and local communities. The rhetoric of GMOs as a 'solution' to hunger masks deeper issues within the global food regime and the influence of corporate interests on agricultural policies. Chapter Eight critiques the corporate-led food transition as a green-washed strategy that reinforces existing power structures and benefits big agribusiness and tech giants under the guise of sustainability and climate action. True food security and environmental health require a shift towards genuinely sustainable and localized agricultural practices, with an emphasis on maintaining environmental biodiversity – and not some war on carbon. Chapter Nine takes on the ecomodernist vision of a future dominated by biotech and urbanization. Chapter Ten uses the situation in the Netherlands as a microcosm of the larger global debate over the future of food and agriculture. The tensions between technological advancements and traditional farming practices, between corporate interests and local autonomy, highlight the problems with the United Nations and their exploitative climate change policies. Chapter Eleven addresses the struggle against genetically mutilated food and ecomodernist ideologies. It requires a critical examination of the techno-industrial model, a commitment to sustainable and equitable alternatives and a willingness to resist the forces of corporate dominance and technological control. Finally, Chapter Twelve looks at the current food crisis, which is not an unforeseen calamity, but a crisis by design, driven by policies that prioritize corporate profits and geopolitical dominance over human needs and environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 plandemic and ongoing climate change economic policies are starving populations and driving up the price of food, while making a way for multinational businesses to control the food supply so they can introduce synthetic, lab-grown strains, ramp up a new processed food industry infused with insects and other filth, and spread GMOs and other pesticide-ridden foods across the planet.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-ohio-judge-upholds-ban-transgender-treatments-minors.html,Ohio judge upholds statewide ban on transgender treatments for minors,"A judge in Franklin County, Ohio, has lifted the temporary injunction that previously blocked Ohio's ban on transgender treatments for minors, allowing the state ban to push forward. In March, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Ohio, filed a lawsuit against House Bill 68, a law that bans males from competing in female sports teams. HB 68 also prohibits so-called ""gender-affirming care"" for minors, including surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone therapies. At that time, the ACLU argued that the bill violated the 2011 amendment to the state constitution's single subject rule, health care provision, equal protection clause and due course of law provision. The ACLU, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of two families in Franklin County, maintains that ""gender-affirming care"" is essential and lifesaving health care supported by major medical associations, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association. Fortunately, Judge Michael Holbrook of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the lawsuit . Holbrook stated that the amendment does not prevent the state from prohibiting misconduct by healthcare providers, and that the state has classified transgender care for minors as misconduct. (Related: U.K. High Court of Justice upholds Downing Street’s ban on PUBERTY BLOCKERS .) ""Upon careful review and consideration of the evidence, the Court finds the Health Care Ban reasonably limits parents' rights to make decisions about their children's medical care consistent with the State’s deeply rooted legitimate interest in the regulation of medical profession and medical treatments,"" Holbrook wrote in his decision. The judge further ruled that so-called ""gender-affirming care"" comes with ""undeniable risks and permanent outcomes."" ACLU plans to appeal against the ruling The office of Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost expressed their approval of the ruling. ""The Attorney General applauds the trial court's decision. This case has always been about the legislature's authority to enact a law to protect our children from making irreversible medical and surgical decisions about their bodies. The law doesn’t say 'no' forever; it simply says 'not now’ while the child is still growing,"" said Bethany McCorkle, the communications director of Yost's office. With this decision, Ohio becomes the 23rd state to ban the so-called transgender health care for minors. However, the ongoing legal battle promises further developments as the ACLU prepares to appeal . ""This loss is not just devastating for our brave clients, but for the many transgender youth and their families across the state who require this critical, life-saving health care. While this decision by the court is a genuine setback, it is not the end of the road in our fight to secure the constitutional rights of transgender youth, as well as all Ohioans' right to bodily autonomy. We are appealing immediately,"" said ACLU Legal Director Freda Levenson. Moreover, the ACLU stated on its official account on X: ""An Ohio judge rejected our challenge to HB68, allowing the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth to take immediate effect. Make no mistake – we will appeal this decision immediately. The fight for trans youth is not over."" Check out Transhumanism.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-lesbian-couple-poland-charged-brutal-abuse-boy.html,Lesbian couple in Poland charged with BRUTAL long-term abuse of 4-year-old boy,"A lesbian couple in Poland has been arrested for allegedly subjecting their four-year-old child to brutal long-term abuse . The young victim, who has a congenital bone condition necessitating multiple surgeries by the age of four, was found wandering the streets alone on July 31, clad only in his shoes. His body bore numerous injuries, including damage to his left shoulder, chest, right cheek and left eye socket. That day, a bystander discovered the boy on the street and immediately took him to the local police station. This led to the arrest of his biological mother, Julia B., and her lesbian partner, Patrycja J. (Related: Lesbian couple sentenced to 20 years for extreme physical abuse of their five-year-old son .) According to official statements, Patrycja J. inflicted physical and psychological torment on the boy. This included starvation, verbal abuse, threats of abandonment and physical violence such as punching, biting, choking and beating him with cables. The couple lived together with three children, but the abuse was only allegedly severe toward the four-year-old. Reports detail how the boy endured relentless torment despite his disability and need for medical care. The office of the District Prosecutor in Gliwice has brought forth charges that paint a grim picture of the child's ordeal. LGBT family structures often lead to child abuse The incident has reignited debate over the safety of children in households with LGBT parents. Local pro-life outlets have criticized the acceptance of LGBT family structures, citing the case and drawing parallels to reported instances of child abuse in similar households. For instance, in a similar case in 2017, police arrested a lesbian couple in Muskogee, Oklahoma for torturing and beating a five-year-old boy so badly that he suffered from two strokes and several other injuries. At that time, the couple was charged with 25 years in prison. The harrowing details of the abuse emerged when he was transferred from a clinic in Muskogee to St. John Medical Center in Tulsa. Initially, the boy’s mother, 28-year-old Rachel Stevens, and his ""stepmother,"" 25-year-old Kayla Jones, admitted the boy for lesions on his face and a series of seizures due to some ""random ailments. The couple had even set up a GoFundMe page to solicit donations for the boy's medical expenses, misleading donors about the true cause of his injuries. However, the doctors in Tulsa quickly became suspicious of the nature of his injuries. Their suspicions were confirmed when it was determined that the injuries were not accidental but the result of prolonged cruel and aggressive physical abuse. Court documents revealed that the boy was also tied up with duct tape, confined in a small room for hours and beaten with a belt. The child recounted being struck on the hand with a hammer by his mother and kicked in the groin by his stepmother, causing severe bleeding.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-big-pharma-who-collude-permanent-market-injections.html,Big Pharma and WHO collude to create permanent market for EXPERIMENTAL injections,"The globalist World Health Organization (WHO) and Big Pharma have colluded to create a permanent market for ""vaccines"" and other experimental treatments , ensuring the uninterrupted flow of revenue. Max Jones of Unlimited Hangout first disclosed the development in an investigative report. According to him, Big Pharma and its key investors are now pivoting toward ""the full takeover of the public sector, specifically the WHO, and the regulatory system that now holds the entire market hostage. Jones added that the pivot seeks to address the so-called ""patent cliff"" – the loss of revenue that followed the expiry of patents for certain drugs, which manufacturers of generic medicines quickly capitalized on. A February 2023 report by Biopharma Dive expounded on the patent cliff , noting that ""blockbuster medicines that had fueled years of growth were losing patent protection."" This exposed pharmaceutical giants to generic competitors. Jones said that to ensure continued profits, Big Pharma firms deployed a ""mergers and acquisitions"" strategy for years, buying up smaller drug companies to add to their product portfolios. Because of this, the industry is now dominated by a handful of companies, conventional chemical drugs exist for most health issues, and the regulatory process for new ones has become onerous. But now, pharmaceutical giants are facing an even larger patent cliff in the form of biological products manufactured from living cells. These products could lose market exclusivity, with more than $200 billion in annual revenue on the line through 2030. Given this, Big Pharma has now sought to acquire biotechnology and biologic companies whose products are ""more complex, unpredictable and difficult and expensive to make"" than chemical-based medicine. According to the Defender , biologics offer an appealing solution to the patent cliff problem as they can't be easily replicated like generic versions of conventional drugs. Max Jones: WHO is an arm of Big Pharma But Jones pointed out in his investigative report that the serious safety issues associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine make it difficult for drug firms to find commercial success in a conventional regulatory environment. (Related: Korean scientists claim Pfizer, Moderna mRNA vaccine vials contain self-assembling nanoparticles that can form into clots. ) He added that luck was on Big Pharma's side as the WHO and its private backers, ""are pursuing an unprecedented legal process that would cement loopholes that could solve these significant market challenges of at least some biotechnologies."" Such loopholes, according to Jones, contributed to the ""market success"" of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. Jones also noted how ""fast-tracked, deregulated development and mandated consumption of the experimental drugs"" enabled the distribution of the COVID-19 injections to approximately 70 percent of people around the world. This could happen again, as he mentioned the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority – an agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – giving Moderna $176 million to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. According to his report, the process of rapidly developed and mandated experimental drugs was first adopted by the U.S. military for bioweapons threats. This time, the global health body – via its revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and its continued attempt to push the so-called pandemic treaty – seeks to internationally legitimize this process. During the last meeting of the World Health Assembly in June, the IHR amendments were watered down and the pandemic treaty was partially thwarted. But the WHO and its backers are still hoping to advance these next year. ""At the forefront of this push are WHO's public-private-partners/private stakeholders, who directly shape and benefit from this policy,"" Jones wrote. ""Their influence has, in effect, turned the WHO into an arm of Big Pharma , one so powerful that it already demonstrated its ability to morph the entire international regulatory process for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

There were originally supposed to be 15 cancer doctors aboard the same flight, but seven of them changed their itineraries to take an earlier flight that same day. Those seven survived while the other eight perished along with everyone else on the flight. It apparently took a while to identify the name of the conference at which these cancer doctors were scheduled to attend.

Pfizer betting big on cancer – were they behind this? SBTMO, by the way, stands for the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Its purpose is to establish voluntary standards and accreditation programs for cellular therapy. ""In a simpler sense, they decide what is considered real or fake in that cancer field,"" the Dom Lucre X account explains. ""If a treatment or cure is suggested, they decide if it is accredited which determines if the treatment or curr [sic] can be used."" In other words, the oncologists were traveling to the conference to hear the latest developments in the cancer field. Perhaps there were some important discoveries on the docket that had to be stopped? Keep in mind that Big Pharma is all about cancer these days. Even more so than vaccines, companies like Pfizer are betting big on new cancer drugs to keep their profits flowing. Could it be that the doctors on the downed flight had information or discoveries that threatened to make cancer a thing of the past without expensive new drugs? Were the doctors silenced to keep them from upsetting the apple cart? ""They've been preventing the cure of cancer for decades,"" someone wrote on X, adding that she does not believe in coincidences.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-emails-nytimes-mask-promoting-activist-manipulated-cochrane-review.html,"Emails reveal New York Times mask-promoting activist manipulated and misrepresented the Cochrane Review, which originally found masks useless","Journalist Paul D. Thacker recently exposed corruption at the New York Times . An activist named Zeynep Tufekci misrepresented scientific findings on masks by the Cochrane Review , a prestigious medical journal, Thacker reveals. The investigation is based on hundreds of emails obtained through Freedom of Information requests and leaks from within Cochrane itself. According to internal emails from Cochrane, the New York Times mask propagandist and social media influencer -- Zeynep Tufekci -- pressured Cochrane to publicly criticize its own review showing that masks fail to stop respiratory viruses. This investigation raises significant concerns about the intersection of social media influence and scientific integrity. Thacker’s UnHerd article, titled "" How the NYT Undermined Mask Evidence: Leaked Emails Reveal How Scientists Were Smeared ,"" uncovers a troubling pattern of interference involving Tufekci, Cochrane and the broader scientific community. NYT mask propagandists exposed, manipulating scientific findings and twisting approver’s words In March 2023, Tufekci published an essay asserting that masks are effective against respiratory viruses, while attacking a mask use review by Cochrane. This came in the wake of Cochrane’s February 2023 review on masks , which found scant evidence supporting the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. The review, considered the gold standard in medical evidence, has been consistently critical of masks in prior editions dating back to 2007. However, Tufekci pressured the publisher into an interview, where she twisted the words of those involved with the review and approval process, while misrepresenting their findings. Outside observers picked apart Tufekci’s New York Times op-ed, noting a disconnect between her claims and the established scientific consensus. Tufekci contacted Cochrane’s Michael Brown, who was involved in the review’s approval process, shortly after the publication of a New York Times op-ed critical of mask mandates. The emails suggest that Tufekci misrepresented Brown’s views , citing him as supportive of her arguments while ignoring his actual stance on the review. The emails indicate that Tufekci not only sought to discredit the Cochrane review but also manipulated scientific opinions to bolster her mask mandate narrative. For instance, Brown’s comments were twisted to imply a stronger endorsement of mask efficacy than what he actually provided. Additionally, Tufekci’s communications with Cochrane’s Karla Soares-Weiser, who oversees the review, led to a rushed statement from Soares-Weiser promising revisions to the review — a move that Brown and other scientists argue was driven by media pressure rather than scientific evidence. The situation escalated when Soares-Weiser’s statement about correcting the review was later retracted, as it became clear that no substantive changes would be made. As Thacker points out, Tufekci’s pressure and influence contributed to a public relations crisis rather than a genuine scientific re-assessment. This controversy highlights a broader issue of how major news publications and influential voices on social media can impact scientific discourse and public health policy. This investigation highlights how opinion-driven journalism shapes scientific debates , disregarding evidence-based analysis, manipulating public discourse and behavior. Tufekci’s rise to fame was generated by social media hysteria and corporate media pressure Masks were first used by physicians nearly a hundred years ago, but they were used to stop the spread of bacteria during surgery. Bacteria are hundreds of times larger than viruses and can be blocked by masks. However, respiratory viruses are ubiquitous in nature and readily spread through masks. The World Health Organization, prior to their complicity in spreading propaganda during the COVID-19 scandal, ruled in 2019, as part of their "" pandemic preparedness plan "" There have been a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and face masks have, at best, a small effect on influenza transmission. The researchers who worked on the Cochrane review originally agreed that masks were useless against COVID-19 . However, science, reality, common sense, personal autonomy, medical prudence and human rights have not mattered since 2020 -- when hysteria, propaganda, totalitarianism and corruption merged into a new orthodoxy. Masks are nothing but a sign of compliance to this belief system of hysteria, fraud and abuse. Tufekci’s rise to mask mandate fame occurred in March 2020, when a New York Times media reporter promoted Tufekci’s opinion piece, which generated a tweetstorm and pressured the CDC to alter their federal guidance, mandating people to mask up. In the end, national policy supporting useless medical mandates was established by tweets and a hysterical essay, without any input from scientists or a medical review process. The ensuring mask mandates went on to harm schoolchildren and would lead to abuse and mass harm to people’s immune systems, with no evidence that they prevented a single respiratory illness. Anyone who refused to comply with the insanity was accused of ""spreading covid"" and ""misinformation."" The people who rightfully fought for medical freedom and sanity faced intimidation throughout society and sometimes were segregated from society and wrongfully detained. But those who opposed the mask mandates and stood up for body autonomy were always in the right, and the science is there to prove what was obvious from the start.

Although this disease is notoriously difficult to treat, some people are finding success with a treatment known as fenbendazole. This anti-parasitic drug has been getting some attention for its potential in treating various types of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, which is known for being highly aggressive and having a low survival rate. There have been a number of early studies showing that it can be helpful , although further research is needed to reach a more definitive conclusion. The medication is currently used primarily by vets to treat gastrointestinal parasites in animals, such as hookworms, roundworms and whip worms, but research suggesting that it has the power to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and spur the death of cancer cells by inhibiting glucose uptake and disrupting the formation of microtubules could change the way cancer is treated in the future. Some people are already trying it out with varying degrees of success. One popular protocol is the Stanford Fenbendazole Protocol. On X, Dr. William Makis shared several examples of the protocol in action taken from a Case Series published by the Department of Medicine at Stanford University Medical Center. One of the cases involves a 72-year-old man who was suffering from stage 4 cancer of the urethra who developed metastases in the lymph node, brain and lung. After failing a number of treatments, including radiotherapy, pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, not to mention six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine, he switched to a regimen of 1000 milligrams of fenbendazole orally three times per week, along with vitamin E, curcumin and CBD oil. A CT scan later showed his tumor shrinking by 2 cm before eventually disappearing entirely. Another case involved a 63-year-old man who was suffering from stage 4 renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the pancreas and bone and a 5.3 cm mass. Three lines of chemotherapy were unsuccessful, but he was able to reach remission after taking 1000 milligrams of fenbendazole three times a week; his tumors also shrink considerably. The third case involved a 63-year-old woman who was suffering from stage 4 bladder cancer and had a 7.5 cm tumor. She used chemotherapy and fenbendazole in conjunction with one another, and a follow-up CT found no sign of the disease after treatment. Makis noted the importance of new treatments as we deal with a “tsunami of cancer,” particularly turbo cancers caused by mRNA vaccines, pointing out that the protocol is largely suppressed by search engines. “Every cancer patient MUST have an Alternative Treatment approach, which can be taken concurrently with conventional chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy, as the Stanford Group showed,” he wrote. Global cancer deaths to rise by 93% by 2050 among men A new study that was published in the journal Cancer shows that cancer cases and deaths are expected to surge by the year 2050 among men, especially those aged 65 and older. The study, which was carried out by Australian researchers, projected that the overall cancer cases in men will rise from 10.3 million in 2022 to 19 million in 2054 in a jump of 84%, while deaths from cancer are projected to climb from 5.4 million in 2022 two 10.5 million by 2050 for a rise of 93%. When looking at those older than 65, cancer deaths were projected to rise by 117%. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-johns-hopkins-ordered-add-2m-settlement-fund.html,Johns Hopkins University ordered to add $2M to settlement fund for students not given refunds following cancellation of in-person classes due to COVID lockdowns,"Johns Hopkins University has been ordered to pay an additional $2 million into a settlement fund for students who paid tuition for the first semester of 2020 but did not receive refunds after the university canceled in-person classes due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns. In March 2020, midway through the spring semester, Johns Hopkins canceled all in-person classes but resisted issuing refunds . The university argued that the online-only classes fulfilled their contractual obligations to students. However, Elena Botts, the former student who initiated the lawsuit, disagreed. (Related: Were COVID lockdowns and ""distance learning"" PLANNED to make today's kids and the next generation of adults DUMB ENOUGH to vote for more communism? ) ""Defendant is attempting to replace the irreplaceable – on-campus life at an elite university – with 'virtual learning' via online classes, and is attempting to pass off this substitute educational experience as the same as or just as good as fully participating in the university's academic life,"" her suit, filed in May 2020, stated. Johns Hopkins initially sought to dismiss the litigation, but decided to settle after a federal judge rejected its appeal. It cited the uncertainty of the case outcome and the substantial risk and expense of prolonged litigation and appeals as reasons for settling. On July 31, United States District Judge Julie Rubin of the District Court for the District of Maryland signed the order after identifying an additional 2,607 students who had paid for the 2020 spring semester but had not been refunded. Johns Hopkins has been ordered to deposit an additional $2 million into the settlement fund later this year, which would be in addition to the approximately $8 million the university was already previously ordered to pay into the fund. To date, 10,851 students or former students have received or are awaiting payouts from the fund. The amount each student receives varies, depending on factors such as tuition paid. Scholarships are excluded from refunds. An additional 2,607 individuals have been identified as part of the class, all of whom enrolled at Johns Hopkins for the spring of 2020 and did not receive refunds for their tuition and fees. The tuition for a semester at the time was at least $26,150. In addition to the $10 million being paid to students and former students, the university was ordered to pay $2.2 million in attorney fees for the plaintiffs. Botts, who paid approximately $26,600 to attend the university's School of Advanced International Studies as a graduate student, has been awarded about $16,200 for her role as the lead plaintiff. Johns Hopkins has required COVID-19 vaccination for students and staff Aside from not refunding tuition during the lockdown, Johns Hopkins is one of the 68 undergraduate universities that required COVID-19 vaccination for anyone studying or working on-site until February 2024 . Johns Hopkins enforces vaccination for anyone studying or working on-site, with non-compliance potentially resulting in a denial of access to university property and electronic resources or disciplinary action under the Student Conduct Code. Meanwhile, fully remote students or employees are exempt, and medical and religious exemptions can be requested. However, exemptions may not fully alleviate the impact on unvaccinated students' education. MedicalTyranny.com has more news about authorities promoting COVID-19 vaccines and lockdowns.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-cell-phone-radiation-damages-kills-cheek-cells.html,"Cell phone radiation found to damage and kills cheek cells, study shows","A recent peer-reviewed study has revealed that exposure to 3G cell phone radiation can cause damage and death to cells in the cheek tissue (buccal cells), potentially leading to cancer. The study published in Environmental Research is the first controlled human intervention trial to investigate the harmful effects of mobile phone radiation on human cells. Researchers discovered strong evidence of acute toxicity, which can result in cell damage or death through processes, like apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis (cell injury leading to death). They also observed disturbances in the cell cycle. However, the study did not find any signs of chromosomal damage, such as micronucleus (MN) formation, in the cheek cells exposed to the radiofrequency (RF) radiation used by 3G phones. (Related: Harmful EMF radiation could be found right in your own neighborhood .) Diagnostic radiologist Dr. Rob Brown emphasized the significance of cell damage observed in the study. He pointed out that previous research on the biological effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and RF radiation has been conducted on animals, cell cultures and plants, making it easier for the industry and policymakers to dismiss the findings. Epidemiologist and electromagnetic radiation expert Dr. Devra Davis added that this study builds on previous research showing the dangers of radiofrequency radiation and provides further reasons why people should avoid using phones close to their bodies or heads. (Related: 5G Danger: Hundreds of respected scientists sound the alarm about health effects as 5G networks go up nationwide .) Study summary Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna recruited 42 participants through public ads, with 41 completing the study. The group, which has an average age of 29 years, included 21 men and 20 women, mostly right-handed and with various educational backgrounds. All participants were healthy and maintained a mixed diet with minimal alcohol consumption. Participants were exposed to low and high doses of a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service) signal through a headset on one side of their head for two hours daily for over five days. Buccal cells (cheek tissue) were collected from both cheeks before exposure and three weeks afterward to assess for cellular damage, including chromosomal anomalies and signs of cell death. The study found that exposure to higher doses increased the number of damaged cells, specifically showing a rise in binucleated cells (indicating disrupted cell division) and karyolytic cells (signaling cell death). No evidence of chromosomal damage, like micronuclei formation was observed. However, the results indicated that mobile phone radiation can disrupt the cell cycle and lead to cytotoxic effects, which may contribute to long-term health issues. A limitation of the study was the two-hour daily exposure period, which reflects average mobile phone use in Europe but is shorter than the usage in some other regions. Davis highlighted that Gen Z users report using smartphones for six or more hours daily, suggesting that real-world exposure could be much higher. Tips to reduce mobile phone radiation exposure Research has linked cell phone radiofrequency radiation to various health issues, including brain cancer, DNA damage, hyperactivity, immune dysfunction, memory loss, oxidative stress and sleep disturbances. Here are some simple steps to minimize your exposure . Don't keep your phone on your body. Carrying a powered-on mobile phone close to your body means more than half of its radiation is absorbed by your brain and body. To reduce exposure, turn off your phone before carrying it in your brassiere or pocket. (Related: Radiofrequency radiation linked to brain damage and Alzheimer’s, experts warn .) Maintain distance. Keep your mobile phone away from your head and body whenever possible. Use a speakerphone mode, a hands-free set, or an air-tube-wired headset to create distance. Protect your reproductive health. Radiation from mobile phones can harm ovaries and sperm. Avoid placing your laptop computer or phone on your lap as these increase radiation exposure to your reproductive organs. (Related: Cellphone radiation hurts men’s ability to conceive, study confirms .) Avoid using your phone with a weak signal. When your mobile phone struggles to connect (with two signal bars or less), it increases its radiation output significantly. Consider texting instead of calling but never text while driving. Keep calls short. Limit talk time and choose texting over calls to reduce both exposure duration and proximity to your body. Limit use in metal enclosures. Avoid using your mobile phone in buses, cars, elevators, planes or trains, as the metal surroundings can amplify radiation. Your mobile phone’s radiation can also affect others nearby. Don’t sleep with your mobile phone on. Cell phone radiation can disrupt your sleep. Turn your phone off or switch it to airplane mode before bed. Use airplane mode. When not using your wireless features, switch your cell phone to airplane mode and turn off Bluetooth and hotspot functions to reduce radiation. Manage App radiation. Apps on your smartphone continuously update in the background, emitting radiation. Delete unused Apps and turn off auto-sync for those you need–syncing manually when your phone is at a distance or connected via Ethernet. Hardwire your connection. Connect to the internet using an Ethernet cord with the right adapter–eliminating the need for WiFi. Learn how to hardwire a cell phone to Ethernet step-by-step . Choose low-radiation phones. Opt for a mobile phone with a low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which measures the amount of radiofrequency radiation absorbed by your body. Use a corded landline. Cordless phones emit microwave radiation similar to cell phones. Use a corded landline at home or in the office to avoid unnecessary exposure. Limit children’s phone use. Children’s thinner skulls and developing brains are more susceptible to radiation. Restrict their cell phone use to emergencies only. Beware of protective ""shields."" Devices claiming to reduce radiofrequency radiation exposure often do the opposite–causing mobile phones to boost radiation output to maintain signal strength.

New Zealand is leading the way with a new pandemic plan that allows the minister of health to utilize ""special powers"" in the event of an emergency, allowing politicians to become dictators. The goal is to force everyone to take every new ""vaccine"" that comes down the pike for whatever contrived ""pandemic"" they come up with next. According to the plan, the minister of health will have the power to ""detain, isolate, or quarantine persons, places, buildings, ships, vehicles, aircraft and animals"" in the event of a public health scare. Unelected medical officers will have the power to force people to take experimental drug shots, drug pills and other pharmaceutical poisons for their own good , much like what happened during the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) ""pandemic."" Police will also have newfound authority to help medical officers and other public health officials enforce the new rules, which will be mandatory for everyone (except those on the top, presumably). (Related: The United Nations [UN] is in on it as well with plans to end world hunger – by ending most of humanity – by 2030.) Europe's ""vaccination card"" program about to go live By the time you read this, Europe will have also enacted a new ""vaccination card"" program that is being piloted in the following five member nations of the European Union (EU): Belgium Germany Greece Latvia Portugal Known as the European Vaccination Card, or EVC, the program will put each person's entire vaccination history on a single card, sheet or file, in the case of smartphones. Vaccines Today shared an example of how the program works using a 27-year-old nurse named Anna who recently moved from Bremaria to Morvania with her family. Anna and her family now live in a place where they must all provide their vaccination history on demand in order to comply with local regulations. ""She goes online, creates an EVC account with the provider of her choice, and enters her vaccination data from Bremaria,"" the report explains about how ""simple"" and ""easy"" it is to participate in the EVC program. ""Local regulations,"" no matter how compelling, are not law, mind you. As we saw with covid, they are created in an instant by unelected bureaucrats at bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) to control the populations of the world like cattle. ""The [European Vaccination Card] piloted by EUVABECO will use the GDHCN's trust network, allowing Member States to bilaterally verify the authenticity of digital records through an interoperable trust architecture*,"" explains the EUVABECO website about how it works. ""While similar to the EU Digital COVID Certificate in being a portable vaccination record, the EVC serves a different purpose.

This empowerment is crucial for ensuring continuity of care for those crossing borders or transitioning between healthcare systems."" The site goes on to explain that the EVC program is available in both printed and digital formats, depending on a person's comfort level. ""It will feature comprehensive vaccine history information, including detailed textual records, a scannable QR code and downloadable embedded metadata,"" the site continues.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-12-leftists-declare-no-more-discrimination-in-sports.html,"Leftists declare NO MORE DISCRIMINATION in sports, meaning biological males can simply SAY they are “female” and dominate boxing, wrestling, track, weightlifting","It is obviously bad enough that the “gender-fluid” cult has invaded daycare centers, school curriculums and bookstores nationwide, flaunting themselves in stripper clothes while reading toddlers and little kids their story books, but now the philosophy of “no discrimination” has flown completely off the rails. The gender-bender cult of insanity wants everyone to accept cross-dresser men beating down women in power-based sports like boxing and wrestling, so men can take women’s trophies, their Olympic medals , their sponsorships, their limelight and their pride. All that hard work down the drain. It’s insane. According to the insane gender-fluid Leftists: If a 35-year-old man who weighs 250 pounds “identifies” as a 12-year-old boy, he can compete in a middle school wrestling championship, brutally beat up a bunch of preteen boys, and that’s great, because it falls under the umbrella of “no discrimination.” Sure. According to the insane gender-fluid Leftists: If a 22-year-old Olympic champion track star “identifies” as a 65-year-old woman, then he can compete in a women’s 5k race in the senior age bracket, demolish everyone and that’s fair. How did it come to this? How much does natural male testosterone matter for strength, speed and agility-based sports? Testosterone is a natural steroid that helps build muscle by generating proteins. Testosterone is an anabolic-androgenic steroid that is a key chemical in the critical functions impacting strength, bulk and athletic execution. Here are some examples of general differences in biological males and females when it comes to strength, speed and agility in certain sports, mostly thanks to testosterone. In a punching power study conducted by researchers, male’s average power during a punching motion is 162 percent greater than females, with the least-powerful male STILL STRONGER than the MOST POWERFUL woman. Think about that. This is all based on the potential impact force that’s reachable based on punch speed, delivery time and the person’s body weight. Elite athletes can exert up to 800 psi, whereas the average female only exerts up to 150 psi. When it comes to powerlifting, among the elite strength-trained females, they range between 46 and 61 percent LESS power for squats, bench press and deadlift, compared to the male powerlifters. When it comes to speed, in a 5K race, for example, men tend to run about 20 percent faster than women, but as the distance gets longer, like in a marathon, the male advantage reduces to about 10 percent quicker. Bottom line is the science proves that men, on average, are going to decimate women in sports where strength, speed and the execution of those developed muscles are core to winning. The real discrimination lies in ruining the lives of females who, for many, have trained for a decade or two to get to their level of competition, and to simply rip that to shreds because some guy wants to wear a little makeup and pretend that he’s female for a while (just long enough to steal the gold), that’s a huge problem. Just look at what happened in cycling competitions recently. A triplet of males who like dressing up as females WON the Grand Prix bike race in Washington. No bullying is the policy at that venue, just like it’s always opposite day when liberals are put in charge. The real females got pummeled and beat down like elementary school girls trying to fight high school guys. The goal was to protect the self-esteem of the fantasy-living men who like to have sex with other men and pretend they are women, then carry that whole “philosophy” over into sports, all to protect the LGBTQ+ sensitivities of their lifestyle. What if the women competing are also gay, don’t they have rights?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-12-bulgaria-bans-lgbt-propaganda-in-preschools-schools.html,Bulgaria bans LGBT propaganda in preschools and schools,"The Bulgarian National Assembly, the country's parliament, has passed an amendment to its National Education Act that bans preschools and schools from promoting ""non-traditional"" sexual relations, orientations and gender identities . The amendment, introduced by the conservative and nationalist political party Revival, was approved on Aug. 7 following four hours of heated debates. The legislation passed in two readings, with 135 members of parliament voting in favor, 57 against, and eight abstaining. Under the new law, Bulgarian pre- and elementary schools are banned from promoting the ""propaganda, popularization and incitement"" of all ideas related to ""non-traditional sexual orientation or determination of gender identity other than biological."" The legislation defines non-traditional sexual orientation as anything ""different from"" heterosexual attraction. The bill received broad support in the National Assembly. Along with Revival, the bill also receive votes from the moderate conservative GERB-SDS, the leftist Bulgarian Socialist Party, the Turkish minority interest party Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) and the big tent populist There Is Such A People party. Only the liberal centrist party We Continue the Change – Democratic Bulgaria indicated its strong opposition to the amendment. Revival leader Kostadin Kostadinov, in arguing for the bill, noted how LGBT ideology is ""not humane"" and described the promotion of non-traditional relationships in schools as ""anti-human."" DPS MP Yordan Tsonev echoed these sentiments and claimed there was ""no place"" for such education in schools. GERB former Bulgarian Education Minister Krasimir Valchev also supported the bill, stating that children ""should not be subject to such influences."" More European countries are banning LGBT propaganda to protect minors Bulgaria is not alone in prohibiting LGBT propaganda. In 2021, Hungary, led by conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, passed the ""child protection"" law . The legislation restricts the ""depiction or promotion"" of homosexuality in content for minors, including television, films, advertisements and literature. The law, part of a broader initiative that increases criminal penalties for pedophilia and creates a searchable database of sex offenders, also forbids the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and restricts the public depiction of ""gender deviating from sex at birth."" Meanwhile, in March, Georgia introduced a bill seeking to ban all LGBT propaganda in the country to protect society from pseudo-liberal ideology and its inevitable harmful consequences. ""Georgian society has always been tolerant, but it cannot be tolerant towards pseudo-liberal propaganda,"" Mamuka Mdinaradze, majority leader of the parliamentary faction of the Georgia Dream party in the chamber, said earlier in March. ""We are witnessing serious trends in the spread of pseudo-liberal ideology worldwide. This propaganda is becoming increasingly aggressive. Most importantly, the propaganda has serious consequences."" (Related: Georgian MP introduces bill that seeks to ban LGBT propaganda and indoctrination efforts – most of which target youth .) As of now, the Georgian parliament has already approved the package of laws in the first reading.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-12-sunlight-exposure-reduces-cancer-risk-study-finds.html,"Sunlight exposure reduces cancer risk, study finds","Solar radiation accounts for more cases of skin cancer than any other single factor. In the United States, skin cancers are the most prevalent, leading dermatologists to frequently advise sun avoidance. Despite this, the most fatal skin cancers are associated with insufficient sunlight exposure . Emerging evidence suggests that sunlight exposure, particularly due to the vitamin D produced in the skin under solar radiation, could have beneficial effects on certain cancers. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) shed light on the potential benefits of sunlight in reducing cancer risk and improving outcomes. Two independent epidemiological studies showed intriguing evidence that solar radiation could play a beneficial role in both the incidence and prognosis of certain cancers. (Related: A healthy dose of sunshine is vital for good health .) The first study explored the link between ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the risk of developing malignant (cancerous) lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conducted in Denmark and Sweden, the research involved nearly 3,800 patients diagnosed between October 1999 and August 2002, along with almost 3,200 population controls. Participants provided detailed histories of UV exposure, skin cancer and other potential lymphoma risk factors. Results from multivariable-adjusted analyses showed a consistent and significant reduction in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk with higher UV light exposure. Frequent sunbathing, sunburns at age 20 and sun vacations were associated with 30 to 40 percent lower risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These protective effects strengthened with increased UV exposure. Although similar patterns were observed for Hodgkin's lymphoma, the associations were weaker. Notably, a history of skin cancer doubled the risk of both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas – suggesting that the protective effect of UV is unlikely mediated by skin cancer. Sun exposure linked with lower mortality rates from certain skin cancers The second study examined the relationship between sun exposure and mortality from cutaneous melanoma, a particularly aggressive form of skin cancer . The study, published in the journal Journal of the National Cancer Institute , analyzed over 500 melanoma patients from a population-based study and followed them for an average of more than five years. Researchers collected data on intermittent sun exposure, physician screening and skin self-screening during in-person interviews and histopathology reviews (which include Breslow thickness, mitoses and solar elastosis). Key findings indicated that higher intermittent sun exposure, skin awareness, solar elastosis (skin changes due to chronic sun damage) and sunburns were significantly associated with lower melanoma mortality . Conversely, factors, such as melanoma thickness, mitoses (cell division rates), ulceration and location on the head and neck were linked to higher melanoma mortality. Multivariable analyses confirmed that skin awareness and solar elastosis were strong indications of improved melanoma survival – even after accounting for tumor thickness, mitotic index and head and neck location. These studies suggest that sunlight exposure, particularly through the vitamin D synthesis it promotes, may have protective effects against certain cancers that improve survival rates in melanoma patients. While it remains essential to balance sun exposure to prevent skin cancer , these findings highlight the complex and potentially beneficial role of sunlight in cancer prevention and survival.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-11-tim-walz-eight-babies-survived-abortion-die.html,"Tim Walz left EIGHT babies who survived botched abortions to DIE, government data shows","The horrific pro-death policies of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the official running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, resulted in at least eight babies who survived the abortion process being left to die on the operating table , data from the Minnesota Government of Health shows. Before Walz was installed as Minnesota's governor, there was a law on the books that required abortion clinics to report all instances of failed abortions that resulted in the live birth of a baby. Such reporting required abortion ""doctors"" to reveal what actions were taken to preserve the life of the baby after birth, as well as whether or not the baby survived. Walz has since abolished that reporting requirement. Under his leadership, abortion clinics in Minnesota no longer even have to keep track of born-alive babies who survive abortions. This means that countless babies will now be slaughtered after birth because the abortion procedure failed to murder them while they were still in the womb. (Related: Did you know that Kamala Harris wants to abolish ICE, ban natural gas fracking and offshore oil drilling, defund the police, and provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens?) The political party of death We know from the data that is still being reported under the reporting law that at least eight babies who survived the abortion process were left to die without any care. Five such babies were reported this way between Jan. 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2021. ""No measures were taken to help the first baby, who reportedly had 'fetal anomalies' that resulted 'in death shortly after delivery,'"" writes Mary Margaret Olohan for LifeNews.com . ""Two of the babies were given 'comfort care measures' as they died. No measures were taken to 'preserve life' of the last two babies, who were previable."" While there were no reported cases of live-birth babies being left to die in 2020, another three such cases were reported between Jan. 1, 2019, and Dec. 31, 2019. ""The first baby reportedly had 'fetal anomalies' but also had 'residual cardiac activity' for two minutes, yet no efforts were taken to preserve that baby's life, and 'the infant did not survive,'"" Olohan explains. ""The second baby died while 'comfort care measures' were provided. The third baby was previable and did not receive any attempts to preserve his or her life. In May 2023, Walz repealed the bipartisan reporting requirement for survived abortions, stripping Minnesota of having to care for and preserve the ""life and health"" of babies who are born following a failed abortion. This is a good fit for Kamala whose position on abortion, also known as baby murder, is that it should be allowed to happen at any time, even after a baby is born – this is known as infanticide . Former President Donald Trump warned about this when he stated publicly that some states have legislation on the books ""where you can execute the baby after birth."" A CNN ""fact check"" claims that Trump's claim is false, but the proof is clear as day for anyone willing to see it. ""Post-birth abortion is real and Harris-Walz support it,"" tweeted The Heritage Foundation's Roger Severino. ""At least 5 babies were born alive after botched abortions and left to die under Walz's watch. Two of these struggling babies were given 'comfort care' instead of medical care allegedly in violation of state law."" ""How did Walz respond? By repealing the very law exposing and outlawing this horror and replacing it with abortion on-demand on the front end, and infanticide on the back end.""

Those who ""threatened to do so anyway,"" meaning those who defied Walz's mandate that everyone stay at home indefinitely, faced a fine of up to $25,000. The ""activities and establishments"" that were ""paused"" at the time under Walz included: - Social gatherings with other households - In-person dining - Adult and youth sports, fitness gyms and other activities that bring people together - Bowling alleys, bingo halls and theaters - Receptions, private parties and other celebrations - Outdoor events and entertainment (Related: Did you hear? Politicians in the United Kingdom are pushing for another round of COVID-style lockdowns to address unfolding ""civil war"" over immigration.) Tim Walz set up special snitch hotline to report non-COVIDiots for violating his mandates Another thing Walz did during COVID was set up a special snitching hotline that allowed Minnesota's COVIDiots to rat out their non-COVIDiot neighbors for violating his mandates. Thousands of people who were full of fear about COVID reportedly called the hotline to tattle-tale on their friends and neighbors for playing basketball in the local park, walking their dogs and having a few people over for a gathering. ""The hotline was launched in March 2020 and law enforcement continued to monitor it until November, well after the stay-at-home order ended,"" a news report explains. ""In October 2020, it was used to alert authorities to a church service that didn't fit with the governor's 'legal requirements.' This type of complaint was not uncommon."" Mocking the stupidity of these rules imposed by Walz, someone on X put it like this: ""Don't hang out with people who don't live in your home. If you do, we are going to throw you in a cage with a bunch of people who don't live in your home."" Another described Walz as ""an authoritarian socialist"" who is far from the ""moderate"" the corporate-controlled media is now attempting to recategorize him as being. ""He's not a good governor or leader,"" this person added. It almost seems like the powers that be (TPTB) are trying to throw the election by putting up ""the absolute worst candidates they could find,"" wrote someone else about how strange all these political picks are from Walz to Vance and all the rest. ""These people deserve to be treated like they treated us,"" another added. ""Walz should never be allowed to be in charge of people ever again."" Another shared the following image of Minnesotans rallying against Walz's COVID fascism: Most of the country may not know who Tim Walz is, but Minnesotans who lived under his covid tyranny sure do. Throwback to that time in 2021 when I organized 80 volunteers to man this booth for a week at the MN state fair. The most popular booth and it wasn’t even close. pic.twitter.com/hvRtgTfBHE — Camellia (@RareCamellia) August 6, 2024 ""Of course she chose a bossy creep,"" said another X user about Kamala's choice of Walz.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-11-who-monkeypox-vaccines-globalists-pandemic.html,WHO seeks “emergency use listing” for monkeypox vaccines as globalists try to launch another pandemic scare,"The World Health Organization has set the process in motion for granting an emergency use listing to a pair of vaccines targeting the monkeypox virus as globalists desperately try to launch a monkeypox pandemic scare just three months before the election. An emergency use listing is used by the organization to support member states that have not authorized an unlicensed vaccine or therapeutic in speeding up the process so they can be administered to the population. According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the move will enable people in lower-income countries that still haven't approved the vaccines to access them sooner. “Emergency Use Listing also enables partners including Gavi and UNICEF to procure vaccines for distribution,” he said. Emergency use listing is the same designation that was used during the COVID-19 pandemic to help member states authorize and distribute the experimental vaccines to the masses. According to Tedros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of a severe monkeypox outbreak, recording 14,000 cases and more than 500 deaths. At least 50 confirmed cases have been reported in nearby countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Burundi. The World Health Organization declared monkeypox, which they now refer to as mpox, as a global emergency after it had spread to more than 70 countries in 2022. The declaration was made against the advice of an independent review panel. Tedros has also announced that the World Health Organization is working on a $15 million response plan that will be responsible for surveillance, readiness and response activities. There will also be a meeting of the emergency committee under the International Health Regulations to determine whether the current outbreak can be considered a “public health emergency of international concern.” Tedros stated: “The committee will meet as soon as possible and will be made up of independent experts from a range of relevant disciplines from around the world.” The disease, which largely affects men who are gay and bisexual, is rarely fatal and no deaths from it have been reported in the U.S. so far. The symptoms tend to be mild and include a rash, fever and swollen lymph nodes. Some people may experience back pain, muscle aches, a lack of energy, severe headaches and skin eruptions. Scaring people into getting vaccines Despite the mildness of the disease, several government contracts have shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to vaccine makers to stockpile the jabs. However, experts like Dr. Meryl Nass, a biological warfare expert and internist, point out that the efficacy of these vaccines is questionable. Their labels indicate that their efficacy rates are inferred based on the results of immunogenicity studies that look at antibody responses instead of confirming that a vaccine actually provides protection against the disease in question. There are currently two monkey pox vaccines, Jynneos and ACAM2000, both of which were originally approved for smallpox. In 2019, Jynneos received a license for use against monkey pox despite the absence of an outbreak at the time. ACAM2000, meanwhile, has been used during the current outbreak as part of an expanded access investigational new drug protocol and has been causing pericarditis, myocarditis and other severe side effects at a high rate. Conveniently, early research shows that the antibodies from these jabs decline a year after getting the shot , which could provide a nice recurring income stream from boosters for vaccine makers if they can convince the world that the illness is a legitimate health threat.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-11-who-tedros-mulls-emergency-declaration-monkeypox-outbreak.html,Fearmongering as policy: WHO’s Tedros mulls public health emergency declaration over hyped-up MONKEYPOX outbreak,"World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is considering issuing a public health emergency declaration for monkeypox amid an outbreak of the disease in Africa. ""I am considering convening an International Health Regulations emergency committee to advise me on whether the outbreak of [monkeypox] should be declared a public health emergency of international concern,"" he posted on X on Aug. 4 . The Ethiopian-born Tedros said his agency, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), local governments and partners ""are further scaling up the response to interrupt disease transmission."" But he stressed that ""more funding and support for a comprehensive response are needed."" According to the Epoch Times , ""a public health emergency of international concern is the strongest designation for an outbreak,"" with a similar declaration being made for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in early 2020. A separate statement from the WHO head published in Science noted that the monkeypox virus ""can and must be contained with intensified public health measures"" – another excuse for medical tyranny. These measures include ""surveillance, community engagement, treatment and targeted deployment of vaccines for those at higher risk of infection."" Tedros also noted that ""a further scaling up"" of the monkeypox response already happening in affected countries is ""urgently needed."" (Related: Monkeypox is another simulation SCAM brought to us by the same psychopaths who unleashed covid. ) The last health-related announcement made by the WHO about monkeypox was two years ago, during an outbreak that lasted from 2022 to 2023. During that outbreak that impacted Europe and the U.S., officials claimed monkeypox primarily spread through sexual contact between gay men. Alongside the WHO's declaration, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden also declared an emergency over the virus. Monkeypox detected in 10 African countries, but mostly in Congo Tedros' post was made as the Africa CDC revealed in a report that monkeypox has been detected in 10 African countries this year. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (ROC) recorded more than 96 percent of all monkeypox cases and deaths. Health officials at the ROC said almost 70 percent of cases and 85 percent of deaths in the country are affecting children under 15 years old. The continent's public health agency said there have been an estimated 14,250 cases of monkeypox so far in 2024 – almost as many as those from last year. It added that cases have risen by 160 percent and deaths by 19 percent compared to the first seven months of 2023. Burundi and Rwanda both reported the entry of monkeypox for the first time in their countries, while the Central African Republic (CAR) and Kenya reported new outbreaks in their territories. ""We are very concerned about the cases of monkeypox, which is ravaging [the capital region], CAR Health Minister Pierre Somse said on Aug. 5. An Aug. 4 notice published by the non-profit International Society for Infectious Diseases, which cited the Ugandan Ministry of Health , said two monkeypox cases were confirmed in Uganda. ""Both individuals presented with symptoms such as skin rash, swollen lymph nodes and general malaise,"" the ministry added. Meanwhile, the Kenyan Ministry of Health said it found monkeypox in a passenger traveling from Uganda to Rwanda, adding that the patient was stopped at a border crossing in southern Kenya. The ministry justified the use of medical tyranny in a statement, noting that a single case was enough to warrant declaring an outbreak. Over in South Africa, health officials confirmed that the country now has 22 monkeypox cases and three fatalities. ""Contact tracing and monitoring activities are ongoing in the affected communities,"" the South African Department of Health (DoH) said in an Aug. 4 statement. ""The [DoH] urges all the identified contacts to cooperate with health officials during contact tracing for screening and possible diagnosis to prevent further transmission of this preventable and treatable disease.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-11-kamala-harris-owned-by-big-pharma.html,"Kamala Harris: Owned by Big Pharma, big trans, and big abortion","Throughout her mystifying, skyrocketing political career, Kamala Harris has repeatedly demonstrated her fealty to the pharmaceutical, abortion, and tra nsgender industries, using her position of authority to feed their unquenchable thirst for profit by promoting their manufactured demands for dangerous experimental vaccines, for their monstrous so-called “sex-changing” medical and surgical treatments for young people and kids, and for the devaluing and destruction of human life through abortion. (Article by Doug Mainwaring republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) Harris, along with her newly picked vice-presidential running mate Tim Walz, are dangerous radical extremists, more beholden to lining the pockets of demonic so-called “healthcare” industries than they are to protecting the dignity and flourishing of American lives. Harris: Fighting for Big Pharma profits, not public health Harris has promoted the COVID-19 (C19) vaccine from the start and continues to do so as evidenced by an “up to date” vaccination requirement for all who seek employment at her campaign headquarters. Harris currently demands that those she employ continually update their C19 vaccination status, despite the fact that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have admitted since August 2021 that the C19 jab does nothing to stop the transmission of COVID. “Harris has steadfastly stood by Biden’s federal vaccine mandates, federal mask mandates, as well as lockdowns of businesses, schools, and places of worship all across America during COVID,” noted Nikos Biggs-Chiropolos of the Honest Media Project . “As someone who has spent her entire career trying to please Democratic Party elites and donors, rather than regular people, it is clear that her top priority is propping up powerful companies rather than fighting for better public health.” In a remarkable, damning video from July 2021, Harris spouts off one lie after another about the efficacy of the C19 vaccine. “Getting vaccinated is the single best defense against getting COVID-19 and its variants,” declared Harris, who has never corrected herself or bothered to change her guileful messaging. “First, we all know it doesn’t stop transmission,” said Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, an expert who has documented vaccine safety and efficacy. “Second, where’s the study comparing it to the Brownstein protocol? Or comparing vaccination to Ivermectin? Or comparing vaccination to hydroxychloroquine plus corticosteroids and zinc?” continued Lyons-Weiler. “There have been no randomized clinical trials that made these comparisons.” “She’s literally making this up as she goes along,” he pointed out. “Is it moral for the vice president of the United States to say a vaccine is ‘highly effective’ when it is unable to stop transmission of the virus it is intended to combat?” asked Biggs-Chiropolos. It’s not moral, but her lies certainly helped pharmaceutical companies reap windfall profits from the C19 hysteria that Harris helped to foment. “Her record clearly shows how she is a puppet of Big Pharma rather than a champion of the people,” said Biggs-Chiropolos. But Harris’s confounding continued push to promote the COVID-19 jab is only part of a larger picture of a leader who in reality is nothing more than a tool of nefarious “healthcare” industries. It gets worse. Far worse. Big Trans industry radical In choosing Tim Walz – who as governor declared Minnesota to be a transgender sanctuary state and placed Tampon machines in the boys’ restrooms in public schools – Harris has signaled her support for the burgeoning, multi-billion-dollar transgenderism-technology-medical-industrial complex. “Healthcare” professionals who stand to extract huge incomes from those entrapped in the nightmare of medically mutilated bodies and souls have repeatedly outright lied about the impact of and motivation behind their ghoulish medical practices. That is clearly of no concern to either Walz or Harris. But why? What is the source of their remarkable allegiance? In a video interview published last year, investigative journalist Jennifer Bilek demystified the ascendancy of the cult of transgenderism. It’s all reaping huge profits by permanently mutilating the bodies of vulnerable young people. Bilek explained: This is totally a top-down arrangement of power. … You have a profiteering motive. Absolutely. Drugs. Surgeries. Surgery equipment. Not just the hormones and the puberty blockers, but you have the antibiotics, you have the anti-rejection medications. You have myriad surgeries that people want to have after they have this attack, basically, on their sex, a medical attack on their sex. Then they want to get their neck done, they want to get their Adam’s apple done, and they want to have their jaw shaved off. It’s like a compulsion, and it’s driven through technology. It’s consumerist orgy, and we’re the ones being consumed. People – our sex – is actually being deconstructed. It’s not just an idea, an ideology; it’s actually happening. They are removing young women’s reproductive organs at major hospitals. So, sex is actually medically being deconstructed as well as ideologically, and legally, and linguistically in the culture. But there’s an even more sinister motive behind the rise of the transgendering industry: replacing and transferring human sexual reproduction to the Big Tech. “The corporate state is running away with human sexual reproduction and transferring it to the tech sector,” explained Bilek, a self-proclaimed feminist who has warned repeatedly that “women are being erased in language and law. It’s like we don’t exist.” “When you follow the money like I do, you find the answers,” said Bilek. “It’s all going to the tech sector. They want to take over human reproduction with technology.” By taking away the means of human reproduction from young people and handing it over to Big Tech, huge corporate entities stand to reap billions of dollars annually. The fact is that they see the sterilization of children, teens, and young adults through body and soul-altering medical, hormonal, and social transitioning as a good thing. It’s all about future profits and population control. Bilek said that children being taught that they can choose their sex “is madness, it’s absolute madness, because it goes against the grain of reality.” “Why are they driving an ideology of physical disassociation from your sexed reality?” she asked. “Why is this happening?” “It’s all a part of the medical tech sector that they’re going to profit from,” she reiterated. Bearing children is an occupation of womanhood, and so removing the ability to reproduce is “the pinnacle of objectification,” said Bilek. All of this is well underway, noted Bilek. The transfer of human reproduction to the tech sector is already occurring through “all the big fertility treatments that are out there now: freezing your eggs, and freezing your sperm, and surrogacy.” “They’re researching womb implants. … It’s profiteering, and it’s social control in the sense that they really literally want to break sex apart,” she continued. Establishing transgenderism as normal is imperative if the medical-industrial complex’s move to usurp reproduction from normal married conjugal relations is going to be successful. The push for transgenderism by the likes of Harris and Walz has little or nothing to do with improving lives. It’s solely about creating a new, highly profitable, sustainable revenue stream for industries whose professionals once pledged to “do no harm.” A hardcore abortion industry extremist Harris has proven time and again throughout her career as California’s attorney general, as United States senator, and as vice president that she is 100 percent dedicated to protecting and promoting the abortion industry which earns billions of dollars annually through the slaughter of the unborn in their mothers’ wombs. “The Democratic Party under Harris is as radically pro-abortion as it can possibly be. Short of coming out for killing toddlers, there simply is no way to be more extreme than Kamala Harris and her party now are,” wrote Ethics and Public Policy Center president Ryan T. Anderson in a searing essay at First Things . “She “is a hard-core ideologue – an abortion extremist – and has been since her first days as an elected official. As president, she would be no different.” While serving in the Senate, Harris received a 100 percent voting record from NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood. “From targeting pro-life journalists and forcing pregnancy centers to advertise for abortion in her A.G. days, to voting to override state pro-life laws in her Senate days, she has repeatedly made clear her fealty to the abortion lobby,” recounted Anderson. “Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidency, Harris has sown confusion about her political vision by reversing many of her own publicly stated positions. But one thing remains constant: Abortion is her top priority.” “During her failed presidential campaign in 2019, Harris explained to an MSNBC town hall audience the process by which she would preempt state pro-life laws: Under a Harris administration, any state pro-life law ‘would have to come before my Department of Justice for a review and approval’ before it could take effect. You can imagine how many such laws would have received ‘approval,’” mused Anderson. Pro-abortion groups are thrilled to have Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate. “Vice President Harris is our most powerful advocate and messenger on this issue,” gushed Jessica Mackler, president of the abortion rights lobbying group Emily’s List, which has supported Harris through every stage of her political ascendancy. “With Kamala likely as the next Democratic Presidential Candidate, we can expect nothing less than abortion extremism through all nine months, and after birth, for any reason,” Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins warned on X in July. “Kamala Harris is determined to impose on all 50 states all-trimester abortion without any limits, even painful late-term abortions in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month of pregnancy,” SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser stated , raising a red flag about a Harris presidency. “Harris is so committed to abortion that she can’t see anything else – including the developmental stages of children before birth or the real needs of women,” declared Dannenfelser. “A Harris presidency would be disastrous for human rights,” predicted Live Action President Lila Rose.

First started in September 2021, the CDC's Genomic Surveillance Program was created to track travelers, which the federal agency considers to be ""an especially important group to consider when tracking new and emerging infectious disease."" After the program was launched in the fall of 2021 at just three U.S. airports, the expectation in the coming months was that the program would be disbanded since COVID ended. Instead of shutting the program down, the CDC instead expanded it nearly threefold. The CDC announced that it would be placing ""public health professionals"" at the eight airports, including John F. Kennedy International in New York; Newark Liberty International in New Jersey; San Francisco International in California; and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International in Georgia. ""We wanted to achieve several things: to get the platform set up at three airports, gauge the level of participation, and determine if we could detect variants using pooled sampling,"" said Cindy Friedman, chief of the Travelers' Health Branch of the CDC's Genomic Surveillance Program. ""We achieved our goals and showed proof of concept."" (Related: Did you catch the CDC study showing that heart disease risk skyrockets by 13,200 percent following COVID injections?) First it's voluntary; then it becomes mandatory -- at gunpoint In partnership with XpresCheck, an airport-based company that provides COVID ""testing,"" and Concentric by Ginkgo, a network of more than 60 laboratories with genetic sequencing capability, the CDC hopes to continue probing travelers' nasal cavities and other orifices in search of COVID germs. The CDC did it with the ""omicron"" ( moronic ) strain and others, and now believes it can do it with whatever further mutations COVID presents, probably around Election Day. For now, the program is ""voluntary,"" allowing individual samples to be collected from ""participating"" travelers who are allowed to remain ""anonymous."" Precisely what the CDC is doing with the samples after it collects them remains unknown. ""It started voluntary in China, too, until it wasn't,"" warned someone on X. ""Then they welded apartment buildings shut, forced people to get vaccinated at gunpoint, and hauled everyone else into isolation concentration camps where they were only allowed to be released if they paid a bribe. They even killed every pet in Shanghai."" This same X account, by the way, noted ties between Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance and the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, BlackRock and Peter Thiel. ""Vance's companies deal with gene therapies, mRNA, and young blood,"" this person added. ""There are so many reasons why I refuse to fly anymore, but if I were still flying and they made this mandatory, I'd be done for sure,"" wrote another. Someone named ""Jo Christiansen"" (@JoChristianse13) retold the ugly story of what Andrew Cuomo did to New York during the COVID ""pandemic."" ""Back when Cuomo was trying to introduce contact tracing in New York state, he put the National Guard at JFK on the pretext of them asking travelers what their movements were,"" Christiansen wrote. ""I saw them there as I came through, but I never saw them approaching travelers and the contact tracing was never instituted. I don't think anybody downloaded the app."" ""These psychos collecting airplane toilet wastewater for testing is just sick,"" wrote another about the CDC's weird obsession with human bodily fluids, which it eagerly wants to collect from wherever in order to ""test"" it for ""COVID.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-09-pandemic-2-police-nato-forced-vaccination.html,"Pandemic 2.0 will see police, NATO forcing the world to get vaccinated","The latest version of New Zealand's pandemic plan, which serves as a blueprint for the rest of the world to follow, includes provisions to allow law enforcement and even NATO to enforce the government's mandatory vaccination agenda. Published on July 12, the updated plan arrived just one week after the Bill Gates-bankrolled World Health Organization (WHO) sent Dr. Peter Hotez to tell the world that both the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) should be allowed to punish ""anti-vaxxers"" in the United States. Hotez also mentioned deploying NATO as a weapon against domestic populations that refuse to get jabbed. A modified version of the Civil Defense Emergency Management Act of 2002, the updated plan grants special powers to government officials to override the law during an ""epidemic"" or ""emergency"" to keep the public ""safe"" from harm. The updated plan specifies three special powers that are allowed during a ""threat:"" 1) The power to detain, isolate, or quarantine persons, places, buildings, ships, vehicles, aircraft, and animals 2) The power to prescribe preventive treatment like pharmaceutical drugs or vaccines to people – those who refuse will fall into the first special power category 3) The power to allow police forces to ""do anything reasonably necessary (including the use of force) to help a medical officer of health or any person authorised by the medical officer of health in the exercise or performance of powers or functions under sections 70 or 71"" That third bullet point is especially threatening in that it allows weapons-brandishing state agents to harm people who refuse to submit to the enforcement of these special powers. (Related: New Zealand is leading the way in depopulating the world through mass vaccination.) Get ready for medical martial law, coming soon to a town or city near you New Zealand initially decided to make these changes on March 19, 2020, right before the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) was declared to be a global ""pandemic."" At the time, The New Zealand Herald published an entire article about the need for an updated pandemic plan, which has now arrived. The first pandemic plan in New Zealand was introduced in 2006. It was then updated in 2017 to reflect the passage of new legislation as well as changes in population and demographics. Now, version three of the plan has been unleashed, and it is a real doozy. Imperial College London created a model that New Zealand used to assess how to recreate its pandemic plan. British physicist Neil ""Professor Lockdown"" Ferguson is credited with masterminding it, though there is much controversy surrounding his lack of accuracy. ""Ferguson is one of a small group of global 'scientists' whose job is to control the narrative,"" reports The Exposé about who Ferguson really is. ""The real driving force behind updating pandemic preparedness is WHO."" No longer is the word ""influenza"" included in the title of New Zealand's pandemic plan, thanks to Ferguson's input. This means the range of what can be considered a ""pandemic"" has expanded to include pretty much anything. According to The Exposé , the first time ""special powers"" were actually used in New Zealand was for covid, also known as ""the dummy run."" The next time around will be a hell unlike anything the people of this world have ever seen or could ever comprehend. ""The updated pandemic plan covers the health system response,"" the Ministry of Health ominously said in a statement about the changes.

How quickly minds can change. Follow the science and the testimonials and even the most dogmatic supporters of every jab the CDC recommends, and what you get is damaged humans who know that kind of so-called “medicine” well is poisoned. Hindsight is 20/20, as they say, and the anti-vax advice is now coming from all angles, including doctors, scientists, victims of vaccine violence and even the most popular podcasters in the world. “Before Covid I would have told you vaccines were the most important invention in human history. After Covid, I’m like, I don’t think we went to the moon.” – Joe Rogan Wake up and smell the toxic coffee, folks. This is not a little mercury in the flu shots. This is not some residue of latex in the syringe from the vial cap. Covid mRNA vaccines instruct your cells to create billions of microscopic nanoparticles called “spike proteins” that clog and clot blood vessels , causing chronic damage to ALL systems inside the body. These mRNA jabs are the nuclear missiles of medical “munitions,” the WMDs and now hundreds of millions of vaccine fanatics around the globe are quickly becoming anti-vaxxers. The popular podcaster Joe Rogan has nearly 200 million downloads of his podcast every month and has accumulated over 10 billion total views of YouTube. While performing one of his stand-up comedy routines, Rogan said the unthinkable about vaccines . It’s not often that a Hollywood celebrity, famous actor, comedian, sports commentator and world-renowned podcaster blasts vaccines for being the polar opposite of what the medical industrial complex swears by, but that’s just what happened. Just last year, Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, who helped invent mRNA vaccines, and afterwards, the mass media (fake news) complex tried to destroy Rogan and discredit his reputation for it, showing several clips out of context where he said the “N” word. Now Rogan has come all out, saying he doesn’t only question vaccines now, he thinks they’ve been corrupted and adulterated ever since the beginning (and he’s right, of course). Rogan wasn't kidding when he said, “Before Covid I would have told you that vaccines were the most important invention in human history. After Covid, I’m like… I don’t think we went to the moon.” How many Americans are not simply doubting vaccines or have questions about them, but they’ve experienced the weapons-of-mass-destruction power the mRNA jabs unleashed in their system, and the havoc the spike proteins have wreaked on the heart, the strain on the CNS, and the promotion of cancer tumors, and NOW they want NOTHING to do with any vaccines for a long, long time, if ever again. Forget about “vaccine hesitancy” and “vaccine skepticism,” this is so far beyond simply questioning or doubting vaccines. This is the complete realization that vaccines have ALWAYS been a weapon of the medical industrial complex to CAUSE the health problems they pretend to want to fix, only to “treat” with more chemicals, more snake venom and more QUACK Western prescription pharmaceuticals. Realize that the sickest people on planet earth are those who take multiple prescription medications daily, plus all the CDC-recommended vaccines, and systematically they lose more and more quality of life as time goes by.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-09-battle-good-evil-full-display-paris-olympics.html,Battle between GOOD and EVIL on full display at Paris Olympics,"The battle between good and evil is on full display at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. John Michael Chambers and Juan O'Savin pointed this out during the Aug. 1 edition of ""John & Juan 107: Intel Insights"" podcast. Chambers, the founder of American Media Periscope (AMP), remarked: ""It has been stated and largely agreed upon that this is in fact a battle between good and evil as we can see this on full display recently in Paris at the opening of the Olympics."" He then turned to O'Savin, asking him about his opinion regarding the blasphemous display. According to the intelligence expert and author , people are seeing a repeating theme, with Baphomet and the ""golden calf"" being represented in sporting events in modern times. O'Savin recalled that the Commonwealth Games had a mechanical bull walking through and blowing smoke, with the surrounding performers bowing down to it. According to him, this was a representation of the Bull of Heaven from the Tale of Gilgamesh rampaging across the Earth. (Related: Demon worshipping BAAL ritual OBVIOUS at British Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. ) The intelligence insider also noted that the story of the Bull of Heaven – another representation of the devil alongside Lucifer and Satan – falling to Earth matches the story of the 22 fallen angels who landed at the top of Mount Hermon, as indicated in the Book of Enoch. O'Savin pointed out that this theme of gods falling to Earth being recounted in fables and legends is being seen by people in events like the opening of the Paris Olympics. Paris Olympics served as a venue to promote TRANSGENDERISM O'Savin said the unique thing people need to remember about this year's Olympics was that transgenderism was represented there, particularly in the opening ceremony that mocked the Last Supper with gender-confused drag queens. Many politicians worldwide denounced the opening ceremony, forcing its directors to issue an apology – albeit a half-baked one. ""Why is that? In fact, it's about confusion, which is a mark of Satan himself. The devil's way is confusion, disarray, division [and] disruption,"" he said. ""What has happened in the Olympics itself? What has happened in society planet wide? We have transgenders, for example, in the White House with Michael Obama portraying himself as a woman. You see it in France with the 'wife' of [French President Emmanuel] Macron, a man pretending to be a woman. It's far more prevalent across society than most people realize."" According to O'Savin, it is one thing when society accepts transgenderism as OK. However, it is another thing altogether for society to stomp out womanhood and destroy women's ability to own their spaces. ""This is an attack on womanhood. And I think that part of the question needs to be moving forward now,"" O'Savin said. ""There are all sorts of hidden meanings within the whole Olympic/Olympus imagery that has become more and more blatant to the point now that perhaps it's time for us to decide that we will not participate.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-09-study-increased-cancer-risk-gen-x-millennials.html,Study reveals increased cancer risk for Gen X and millennials compared to older generations,"A new study revealed that millennials and Generation X individuals have a higher risk of developing certain cancers compared to earlier generations. Researchers attributed this increased risk to greater consumption of ultra-processed foods and higher obesity rates among younger individuals. The study, published in The Lancet Public Health by the American Cancer Society (ACS), noted that cancer incidence rates have been rising in younger generations for 17 out of 34 types of cancer , including breast, gastric and pancreatic cancers. Mortality trends also increased in conjunction with the incidence of colorectal, gallbladder, liver (female only), testicular and uterine corpus cancers. Lead study author Dr. Hyuna Sung, senior principal scientist of the ACS Surveillance and Health Equity Science, noted that these findings contribute to the "" growing evidence of increased cancer risk in post-Baby Boomer generations"" and ""expands on previous studies of early-onset colorectal cancer and several obesity-associated cancers to include a wider range of cancer types."" Sung further explained that birth cohorts, defined as groups of people in the same year, experience unique economic, environmental, political and social conditions that influence their exposure to cancer risk factors during critical developmental periods. However, despite identifying these cancer trends related to birth years, the exact reasons for the rising rates remain unclear. Researchers analyzed tens of millions of patients diagnosed with cancer Researchers conducted an analysis using data from 23.6 million patients diagnosed with 34 types of cancer and 7.4 million cancer-related deaths for 25 cancer types. The data, covering individuals aged 25 to 84 years, spanned from January 2000 to December 2019 and was sourced from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the National Center for Health Statistics . To assess cancer rates across different generations, the researchers calculated incidence and mortality rates specific to birth cohorts, accounting for age and period effects. The cohorts were divided into five-year intervals ranging from 1920 to 1990. The study found that cancer incidence rates have risen with each successive birth cohort starting from around 1920 for eight of the 34 cancers examined. Notably, the incidence rates for kidney, pancreatic and small intestinal cancers were approximately two to three times higher in individuals born in 1990 compared to those born in 1955, for both males and females. Additionally, liver cancer incidence in females showed a similar increase. The research also revealed that after a decline in older birth cohorts for nine additional cancers, including anal cancer in males, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, Kaposi sarcoma in males, non-cardia gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer and uterine corpus cancer. Across various cancer types, the 1990 birth cohort exhibited a range of increased incidence rates – from 12 percent higher for ovarian cancer to 169 percent higher for uterine corpus cancer compared to the cohort with the lowest incidence rate. Mortality rates also rose in younger cohorts, mirroring the increasing incidence rates for colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, liver cancer in females, testicular cancer and uterine corpus cancer. A spokesperson for the ACS commented on these findings by noting the concerning trend of rising colorectal cancer rates among younger people who are typically not considered at risk for this cancer type. Identified risk factors include alcohol consumption, obesity, sedentary lifestyles, smoking and unhealthy diets. (Related: Experts, studies recommend eating like your ancestors to boost longevity .) The spokesperson emphasized that the increase in cancer diagnoses among Gen X and millennials is two to four times higher compared to older generations at the same age – suggesting that other factors may also contribute.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-09-vaccine-journalist-jane-hansen-dead-brain-tumor.html,Pro-vaccine journalist Jane Hansen DIES from a BRAIN TUMOR just three years after proudly announcing her Pfizer injections online,"A prominent Australian journalist who bragged online after getting ""vaccinated"" for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is dead at the age of ""in her '50s,"" which is all the public seems to know about the length of her time on earth. Jane Hansen is described as a ""fantastic woman"" who used to report for A Current Affair . She developed glioblastoma a year and a half ago, not long after she got injected with Pfizer's double-dose mRNA injection series. ""Feeling exceptionally blessed to have received my first Pfizer vaccine today,"" Hansen tweeted on July 14, 2021. ""Not a single side effect. Enhancing immunity with a glass of red. Thank you science."" That same day, Hansen tweeted again that she was ""glad I got in for Pfizer,"" adding that ""Lots of people lining up doing their bit"" as well, meaning she believed that anyone else like herself who got jabbed for COVID was doing their part to save humanity. (Related: Prepare for the ""tsunami"" of illness and death that is almost here as a result of Operation Warp Speed.) Hansen despised male culture being shown on TV About a year or so after getting injected with Pfizer, Hansen was diagnosed with ""a vicious brain cancer"" that consumed her body rather quickly. She perished on the Gold Coast at around 11:40 pm on Aug. 6, 2024. Hansen worked at The Sunday Telegraph . Before that, she was a war correspondent. Her family says she put up an ""amazing fight"" to rid her body of the post-injection cancer, but that it was simply not enough to save her. ""We will be in touch soon regarding Jane's funeral arrangement and yes there will be a wake to celebrate this fantastic woman!"" reads a statement from the family. We know as of 2017 that Hansen anonymously co-wrote a ""wickedly entertaining"" novel, released in 2008, called ""Boned."" The book reportedly took aim at ""blokey culture"" in commercial television, ""blokey"" referring to men. Hansen apparently wanted commercial television to be more feminist, claiming that many television veterans were ""horrified by the despicable behavior of men"" in leadership positions. ""When we wrote 'Boned,' we had both left our jobs,"" Hansen wrote about the anti-male project. ""We had young babies and we were freelancing. We'd also been beaten down by the boys' club. We'd been bullied. But we were never victims."" Hansen certainly cashed in on the perceived victimhood she presented in ""Boned,"" which contributed to the anti-male media sentiment that has fast-swept the West in recent years. Hansen dubbed herself an ""anonymous TV whistleblower"" for her contributions to ""Boned,"" which she claimed was her way to ""fess up"" about how she felt concerning male cultural depictions in popular media. In Hansen's mind, her novel was ""unashamedly chick lit."" ""She swore a lot,"" commented The Australian editorial director Clair Harvey, who worked as deputy editor at The Sunday Telegraph during Hansen's time at the media outlet. ""She got outraged a lot. She laughed a lot – and made me laugh – every time we spoke."" On X, one user could not help but notice that this kind of thing seems to be happening a lot lately: many prominent public figures who once praised, bragged about, or lectured concerning COVID jabs are now dead. ""Some would even call it divine intervention,"" the user wrote. The Health Ranger offered his condolences, noting that it is ""absolutely horrible when a 'journalist' who attacks those who tell the truth about vaccines gets jabbed herself, then grows brain cancer tumors and then dies from those tumors.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-09-bishops-social-justice-donated-abortion-lgbt-groups.html,Catholic bishops defending social justice initiative also donated to groups promoting ABORTION and LGBT,"Some Catholic bishops in the U.S. defending a church-run social justice initiative reportedly donated to groups promoting abortion and the gay agenda . Michael Hichborn, founder and president of the Lepanto Institute, disclosed this in a July 28 piece . He pointed out that these bishops who defended the Catholic Campaign for Human Development (CCHD) also earmarked money for groups that go against the Catholic Church's teachings. The CCHD is the national anti-poverty and social justice program of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Hichborn pointed out that the CCHD's frequently asked questions page said its ""national grants process is a partnership between (arch) dioceses and the USCCB."" ""All initiatives supported with CCHD funding complete a thorough application process that includes a pre-application, full application, site visits and other requirements, with involvement on both the national and diocesan levels,"" the page stated. ""CCHD will not fund groups that are knowingly members of coalitions that have, as part of their organizational purpose or coalition agenda, positions or actions that contradict fundamental Catholic moral and social teaching."" Hichborn mentioned several names of bishops, including Hartford, Connecticut Archbishop Christopher Coyne – the former bishop of Burlington in Vermont. During his time in the Green Mountain State, he signed off on a 2020-2021 grant of $55,000 to the Vermont Affordable Housing Coalition (VAHC). The VAHC celebrated Pride Month in the form of an interview with Vermont State Rep. Taylor Small, where VAHC Executive Director David Martins lauded him for being a ""fierce advocate for LGBTQ issues."" Martins himself is an LGBT activist, with the organization's website even acknowledging his work with the Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality. Meanwhile, Lexington, Kentucky Bishop John Stowe approved a $40,000 grant to the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED). However, Hichborn pointed out that MACED is equally problematic as it promoted LGBT ideologies to the youth – contradicting Catholic teaching. Bishops continue to defend CCHD, which promotes anti-Catholic ideas Both Coyne and Stowe defended the CCHD from criticism, including calls for its abolition. The Hartford archbishop expressed his dismay and disappointment regarding staff cuts at the USCCB department overseeing it, while the Lexington bishop – who sits on the CCHD's subcommittee – said he was pleased to see other bishops defending the campaign. Even Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark in New Jersey, also rushed to the defense of the CCHD . According to a June 14 piece by the National Catholic Reporter , the cardinal ""gave a powerful endorsement of the work"" done by the campaign during an executive session of the USCCB that month. Hichborn noted how Tobin provided two grants totaling $80,000 to the New Labor Education & Training Institute (NLETI). According to the Lepanto Institute founder, NLETI is a dues-paying member of both the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and the National Domestic Workers Alliance – two entities promoting infanticide. True enough, NLETI promoted a rally to defend the Roe v. Wade decision and ""reproductive rights"" in 2022, the same year when the abortion ruling was overturned. (Related: Report: 76 Christian universities promoting ABORTION and Planned Parenthood. ) The CCHD was thrust into the spotlight after Ralph McCloud, its executive director, unexpectedly stepped down. Later, several staffers in the USCCB's Department of Justice, Peace, and Human Development – which oversees the CCHD – were laid off, drawing Coyne's ire. ""While each of these prelates of the Catholic Church are rushing to the defense of the CCHD, the sad truth is that each of them are responsible for grants that went to organizations that not only go against CCHD grant guidelines, but directly attack Catholic moral and social teaching,"" said Hichborn.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-excess-mortality-caused-by-democide-vaccine-mandates.html,"Study of 125 countries reveals inconvenient truth: Excess mortality was caused by democide and vaccine mandates, not “covid”","In a bombshell revelation that should reshape the narrative around the “COVID-19 pandemic,” a groundbreaking study involving researchers from Correlation Research in the Public Interest has found that COVID-19 vaccines had little to no beneficial impact on mortality rates, but instead contributed to 17 million deaths globally! The comprehensive global analysis scrutinized excess deaths across 125 countries, challenging the long-held belief that vaccines were pivotal in controlling an alleged pandemic . Dr. Joseph Hickey, Ph.D., president of Correlation and co-author of the study, discussed these startling results on “The Defender In-Depth.” According to the research — which evaluated mortality data from 2015 to 2023 — patterns of excess death do not align with the spread of the virus or long COVID but instead correlate closely with government-imposed restrictions and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines! Bio-terror, isolation, biological stress and compliance with restrictions caused 30 million global deaths Hickey and his team used the “P-score” methodology to adjust for variables like age and health status. Their analysis revealed a significant correlation between excess mortality and socioeconomic factors such as poverty. They argue that the restrictive measures — particularly lockdowns — exacerbated biological stress, adversely affecting the most vulnerable populations. That biological stress includes mandating the isolation of mildly ill individuals and putting them on sedatives and ventilators. Biological stress also includes the intentional harms caused by vaccine mandates and lockdowns that destroyed people's careers and ability to eat. The study revealed that pandemic-related restrictions are linked to an estimated 30 million global deaths, while the COVID-19 vaccines are associated with 17 million deaths. Hickey and his team argue that these findings suggest the pandemic declaration and subsequent isolation measures had a far more significant impact on global mortality than some virus construct. Living in perpetual fear, isolation and constant stress due to government tyranny and societal upheaval has far reaching mental and physical health effects that lead to death and worse outcomes in the face of chronic and infectious disease. Hickey reiterated that the data does not support the theory of a particularly virulent pathogen that remained characteristically dangerous for months and years. Instead, the findings point to totalitarian national policies, medical fraud and hysterical public health measures as the main drivers of excess deaths over time. The study challenges the assumption that the virus was the primary cause of increased mortality, suggesting that the impact of political and public health interventions, including lockdowns and vaccine mandates, are more detrimental. Democide and vaccine mandates caused excess deaths, not a pandemic The research highlights that the observed excess mortality rates during the pandemic were not uniform. Some countries saw sharp spikes in excess deaths coinciding with the implementation of restrictions or the initiation of vaccine roll-outs. In stark contrast, other nations experienced no excess mortality until vaccines were introduced. In fact, countries with higher vaccine uptake experienced persistent excess deaths into 2023. Hickey pointed to potential issues with the vaccine, like vaccine-related immunosuppression and adverse reactions. Instead of addressing these serious public health issues, further booster doses were recommended, with no beneficial impact on society. Australia, for one, saw an abnormal spike in all-cause mortality at the same time they mandated a COVID-19 booster vaccine. Now there is a class action lawsuit to fight back. The world suffered, not from a pandemic, but from a DEMOCIDE that was fueled by medical fraud , bio-terror propaganda, germaphobia psychological programming, mass hysteria and compliance, vaccine worship, and a lack of knowledge on how immune systems work and what can be done to treat people for disease, or treat people humanely for that matter. The COVID-19 scandal exposed the corruption in the medical and pharmaceutical industry and elucidated the proclivity of modern governments to act maliciously against individuals, with no remorse.

Such a world now exists in New Zealand, which just enacted legislation legalizing the use of physical force in order to vaccinate. Dr. Jonathan Engler tweeted a screenshot – see below – highlighting the specific passages in the bill, as summarized in a report, that authorize doctors to call on law enforcement to essentially strap their patients down on a table kicking and screaming while syringe holders standing nearby release the air bubbles and plunge the injections deep within the patients' bodies. ""Section 71A states that a member of the police may do anything reasonably necessary (including the use of force) to help a medical officer of health or any person authorised by the medical officer of health in the exercise or performance of powers or functions under sections 70 or 71,"" reads a passage under ""Special powers"" on page 125 of the New Zealand Pandemic Plan: A Framework for Action . Thought this might be fake / exaggerated at first, but check out numbered page 125 (page 133 of the PDF) from the doc on the NZ Gov website. Yep, NZ want to legalize the use of force to vaccinate refuseniks. https://t.co/l8l5ODiXcu https://t.co/yjeiCPX7iM pic.twitter.com/VpKMTjpLBQ — Dr Jonathan Engler MB ChB DipPharmMed LLB (@jengleruk) August 1, 2024 (Related: Remember when the New Zealand government destroyed evidence that would have implicate it for crimes against humanity during the Wuhan coronavirus [covid-19] ""pandemic?"") If a forced vaccine harms a New Zealander, there is no recourse due to manufacturer immunity from liability Even worse is the fact that the forced vaccines New Zealanders will have to receive come with serious side effects that could leave a person injured or dead. And there is no recourse if that happens because vaccine manufacturers are legally immune from prosecution. John Gideon Hartnett, PhD (@gideon195203) wrote on X that nearby Australia has similar laws in place that allow the state to force someone against his or her will, meaning without informed consent, to take vaccine injections. ""Ours even says 'remove underwear,'"" Hartnett explained about what police Down Under are allowed to do to vaccine refuseniks. Western Australia where Hartnett apparently lives, by the way, imposed some of the world's strictest forms of medical fascism all throughout the covid ""pandemic,"" including mask mandates, closed borders, forced quarantine and other forms of medical persecution. What Australia did was amend both the Emergency Management Act of 2005 and the Public Health Act of 2016 to strip control of the nation's rolling covid emergency powers from medical and health professionals and give it instead to the police commissioner, also known as the State Emergency Coordinator.

Anyone who argues for anything natural that treats, mitigates or cures any disease, disorder or chronic condition will be called a “quack” and referred to as “anti-science” until they comply. But wait. There’s a problem. If you follow the science, the real science, and you look very closely at the evidence-based research, long-term clinical trials (if there are any) and verify whether proper protocol was followed, the science DISPROVES the validity of the major platforms, philosophies and die-hard tenets that these science zealots all promote and propagate widely. Vaccine “science” has always been about creating dirty vaccines for population control more than it has been about creating preventative “medicine” for infectious diseases The CDC has completely revamped their websites and the comprehensive list of dangerous ingredients that are persistently and commonly used in most vaccines. The CDC (Centers for Disease Continuance) does NOT want anyone to follow the science for the never-ending list of known carcinogens and genetically mutated ingredients used in immunizations for humans of all ages and sizes. It’s one-size-fits-all and everything is always “safe and effective,” even if it’s PROVEN by science to be deadly for humans to get injected. The corrupt vaccine industry, working in tandem with the Centers for Disease Continuance, do everything they can to apologize and dismiss the hazards of injecting deadly ingredients into pregnant women, babies, developing children, teens, young adults looking to start a family and elderly folks who are at high health risk from these toxic ingredients being injected directly into the bloodstream. Gelatin is reduced (boiled down) animal parts humans don’t eat. Aluminum helps mercury cross the blood-brain barrier. All forms of mercury are highly dangerous to inject. Formaldehyde is used to embalm dead people. Egg proteins breed the virus and bacteria and cause severe allergic reactions when injected. Vaccines bypass all three normal forms of defense the body uses, including the largest organ (your skin), your lungs and your digestive system. And if you dare to follow the science regarding mRNA clot shots , you may never get another “vaccine” as long as you live. Don’t follow the science when it comes to “Climate Change,” or you’ll figure out it’s all a hoax for rich politicians and globalists to get richer off the schemed fools Whether you take your cash money and throw it in the gutter or donate it to organizations behind the “climate change” agenda, the result is the same. The rich get richer from “science” scamming, and you get poor. Follow the science regarding climate change and global warming and you find out that the beaches are NOT shrinking, the deserts ARE actually shrinking and greening around the globe is literally ACCELERATING. The new slogan for “ climate change ” is “save the deserts!” Don’t follow the science when it comes to gender fluidity, or you’ll figure out that there are only two genders The communists want everyone thinking about sex and sex partners 24/7/365 so nobody will notice that the government in America is methodically and systematically eradicating the constitution, decimating medical freedom of choice and destroying the core of American values, ethics and belief in God. These days, if you call yourself “liberal,” you also must be atheist, or at least agnostic, because you are in the same boat with all the perverts, groomers and child traffickers who train kids to think about sex and sex partners all day long. There’s no following the “science” when it comes to the biology of genders and the healthy role models that parents and grandparents play in the nuclear families that keep the core of our nation strong, wholesome and moral. The gender-fluid cult hates science, and they all support the fake science of “climate change.” One hand washes the other, or in this case, each hand keeps the other hand dirty.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-sk-study-mrna-vaccines-increase-myocarditis-risk.html,South Korean study: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines found to increase MYOCARDITIS risk by 620%,"The mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines increase the risk of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) by six times , according to a study by South Korean researchers. The paper by the study authors from Yonsei University 's Wonju College of Medicine was published July 23 in Nature Communications . The study originally sought to examine the long-term risks of autoimmune connective tissue diseases (AI-CTDs), such as lupus erythematosus, alopecia areata, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis after COVID-19 vaccination. Researchers analyzed data from more than nine million individuals injected with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The data from the nine million were split into two – a vaccination cohort and a historical control cohort. South Korea's high vaccination rate – 96.6 percent of adults completed the primary COVID-19 vaccine series by October 2022 – allowed the researchers to study the health history of the control cohort. Health data for the control cohort was scrutinized for two years before their first vaccine dose up to Dec. 31, 2020, just before the vaccine rollout. Meanwhile, the vaccination group was observed through Dec. 31, 2022. ""Shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak, vaccines emerged as [an] … intervention to address the pandemic,"" the authors wrote. They nevertheless acknowledged that ""the effectiveness of [the COVID-19] vaccine wanes over time"" and that SARS-CoV-2 strains such as the B11529 omicron can bypass vaccine-induced immunity."" Vaccines increase risk of cardiac inflammation The study authors sought to determine the long-term risk of AI-CTDs after injection with COVID-19 vaccines. While their study did not find any link to AI-CTDs with primary vaccination, it found other conditions linked to the COVID-19 injections such as cardiac inflammation and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder. They found that the COVID-19 injections increased the risk of developing myocarditis by 620 percent in the vaccination cohort compared to the control cohort. The risk of developing pericarditis (heart lining inflammation) increased by 175 percent in the vaccination cohort, and the risk of developing GBS increased by 62 percent. (Related: Big Pharma admits mRNA vaccine causes CANCER .) Moreover, the South Korean researchers found that booster doses were associated with an increased risks of developing certain AI-CTDs. This could be associated with autoimmune flare-ups after repeated mRNA vaccination, causing dormant diseases to become active and manifest in the body. ""The result of our study may indicate the necessity for additional monitoring when administering booster vaccinations,"" the authors wrote. They also acknowledged that the COVID-19 vaccines don't work as intended, noting that ""an additional dose of the vaccine could serve as a strategy to address the limitation of its waning efficacy over time."" Children's Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker lauded the ""very robust"" study, but noted the authors' minimization of the most alarming data.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-higher-levels-6-metals-heart-disease-mortality.html,Study links 6 contaminant metals in urine to increased heart disease and mortality risk,"Researchers from Columbia University have found that individuals with high levels of six metals in their urine – cadmium, cobalt, copper, tungsten, uranium and zinc – face a 66 percent higher risk of mortality. In addition, these individuals posted a 29 percent increase of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) . In their study published in the journal Circulation on August 1, the researchers stated that evidence is increasingly showing that involuntary environmental exposures, including contaminant metals, are significant modifiable risk factors for both clinical and subclinical CVD and all-cause mortality. These findings and insights can guide and help develop the creation of innovative preventive strategies to enhance and improve cardiovascular health. Heavy metals are elements and compounds that can negatively impact health. While small amounts of many metals are necessary for life, excessive levels can be toxic. Common heavy metals that people are exposed to include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, cesium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, thallium, tungsten and uranium. (Related: Heavy metal toxicity symptoms explained: Are you poisoned? ) Increasing levels of pollution and the use of industrial chemicals have led to increased exposure and raised the dangers and threat of heavy metal toxicity – greatly endangering child development and overall health and well-being. High levels of these toxic metals in body tissues and the brain can lead to significant development and neurological issues. Research has shown that exposure to certain metals can be linked to CVD and increased risk of death. However, previous studies focused mainly on arsenic, cadmium and lead. (Related: Heavy metal toxicity is a hidden epidemic .) Cadmium, cobalt, copper, tungsten, uranium and zinc linked to coronary artery calcification This study aimed to explore how urinary levels of various metals relate to CVD and overall mortality among a diverse group of U.S. adults as part of the government-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The researchers expanded their focus beyond arsenic, cadmium and lead to include metals like tungsten and uranium, which aren't essential for the body but may be harmful. They also looked at cobalt, copper and zinc, which are essential in small amounts but can be toxic in excess. Cadmium, cobalt, copper, tungsten, uranium and zinc were chosen because they are linked to coronary artery calcification, a sign of artery damage from fatty deposits. The study involved nearly 6,600 participants from cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, St. Paul and the Winston-Salem area of North Carolina, with an average age of 62 years. About 53 percent of the participants were female. Their urine metal levels were measured between 2000 and 2001 and tracked until December 2019. Researchers used statistical models to analyze the relationship between urinary levels of cadmium, tungsten, uranium (non-essential metals) and cobalt, copper and zinc (essential metals) with CVD and mortality rates. They also examined how combinations of these metals affected survival over 10 years. Over the study period, 1,162 participants developed CVD and 1,844 died. When comparing the highest to the lowest levels of these metals, the risk ratios for developing cardiovascular disease and dying from any case were as follows: Cadmium: 1.25 for CVD, 1.68 for mortality Cobalt: 1.24 for CVD, 1.37 for mortality Copper: 1.42 for CVD, 1.50 for mortality Tungsten: 1.20 for CVD, 1.16 for mortality Uranium: 1.32 for CVD, 1.32 for mortality Zinc: 1.21 for CVD, 1.38 for mortality The study found a clear link between higher levels of cadmium and copper and increased risks for both endpoints. The overall survival probability decreased with higher baseline urinary levels of cadmium, cobalt, copper and zinc. The research suggests that higher levels of these metals in urine are associated with an increased risk of CVD and higher mortality rates.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-the-pandemic-vaccine-industry-is-desperate.html,The pandemic-vaccine industry is desperate; for the next “pandemic” they want to use police and even NATO to force vaccinations on people,"New Zealand has included enforcing vaccination uptake using law enforcement in its latest version of the country’s pandemic plans published on 12 July. (Article by Rhoda Wilson republished from Expose-News.com ) A week earlier, Gates-funded and World Health Organisation favourite Dr. Peter Hotez suggested that Homeland Security and the Justice Department should be enlisted against “anti-vaxxers” in the US. And internationally, Hotez said, NATO should be deployed against those who refuse to get vaccinated. The image below has been widely shared on social media with the claim that it is proof that the New Zealand government is planning to legalise forced vaccination. Some thought it might be fake or exaggerated. But it is confirmed by a document titled ‘ New Zealand Pandemic Plan: A framework for action ’ (”Plan”) published on 12 July by the New Zealand Ministry of Health. It confirms that people will be forced to be isolated or quarantined until they have undergone the “prescribed treatment.” The Plan sets out the government measures to be taken to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. It updates the ‘ New Zealand Influenza Pandemic Plan: A framework for action 2017’ . New Zealand has had an Influenza Pandemic action plan since 2006, and this was updated in 2017 to reflect new legislation and population calculations. On 19 March 2020, before the covid pandemic had been declared by the World Health Organisation (“WHO”), The New Zealand Herald published an article alluding to why they believed the pandemic plan needed updating. The 2017 plan relied on pandemic modelling based on certain assumptions. “Ministry of Health director-general Dr. Ashley Bloomfield said new research out of the Imperial College of London had caused a re-think in how [the phases determined by the model] would be managed,” the outlet said . The Imperial College London modelling, as our readers will recall, was the work of the infamous British physicist Neil “Professor Lockdown” Ferguson who has been involved in several controversies regarding his inaccurate modelling throughout his career. Related: Did Neil Ferguson’s modelling of the covid pandemic prove once and for all that epidemiology is useless? Ferguson is one of a small group of global “scientists” whose job is to control the narrative . The real driving force behind updating pandemic preparedness is WHO. In November 2020, New Zealand’s National Emergency Agency updated the information for civil defence emergency management (“CDEM”) groups relating to the Influenza Pandemic Plan . It stated: “The World Health Organisation is concerned that an avian influenza and a human influenza virus might mix” which could result in an influenza pandemic. “New Zealand is planning for the possibility of a pandemic,” it added. The 2024 update – which has dropped the word “influenza” from its title – was “ completed at pace, is limited in scope ” and is part of a wider review of pandemic preparedness that is taking place in two stages. The Plan has a section on “special powers” given to medical officers of health , public health physicians or doctors who are appointed by the Director General of Health. These powers are not new. They were granted in 2002, if not earlier, but during the covid “pandemic” they were used for the first time – covid was the dummy run. The Plan states: Special powers Special powers are authorised by the Minister of Health or by an epidemic notice or apply where an emergency has been declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. The power to detain, isolate or quarantine allows a medical officer of health to “require persons, places, buildings, ships, vehicles, aircraft, animals, or things to be isolated, quarantined, or disinfected” (section 70(1)(f)). The power to prescribe preventive treatment allows a medical officer of health, in respect of any person who has been isolated or quarantined, to require people to remain where they are isolated or quarantined until they have been medically examined and found to be free from infectious disease, and until they have undergone such preventive treatment as the medical officer of health prescribes (section 70(1)(h)). The power to requisition premises allows a medical officer of health to requisition premises and vehicles for the accommodation, treatment and transport of patients (section 71(1)). The closure of premises such as schools can be required under sections 70(1)(1a) and 70(1)(m). This can be made by way of written order to the person in charge of the premises or order published in a newspaper or broadcast by television or radio and able to be received by most households in the district. If specified in the order, premises operating certain infection control measures may be exempted from closure. Section 71A states that a member of the police may do anything reasonably necessary (including the use of force) to help a medical officer of health or any person authorised by the medical officer of health in the exercise or performance of powers or functions under sections 70 or 71. These special powers were used for the first time during the response to COVID-19 . In general terms, they performed well. However, there were some mis-steps in their application, they lack procedural and human rights safeguards and court judgments have found that while they can be used as a stop-gap measure in emergency situations, they are not suitable for sustained, complex responses. [Emphasis added] New Zealand Pandemic Plan: A framework for action ((Interim update – July 2024 ) , pgs. 125 and 126 Ominously, the Ministry of Health states that : “The updated pandemic plan covers the health system response. It does not cover the all-of-government or wider societal response to a pandemic. It is also only one tool for developing the health system’s preparedness.” It is plain to see from the above that they intend broad-reaching powers to be given to a few medical officers who will be able to shut down sections of New Zealand’s economy and detain people at will – or, in their words, when an epidemic notice is issued or when an emergency has been declared which, as we saw with covid, is not the same as an actual pandemic or epidemic occurring. However, we want to focus on the words “preventative medicine.” What does “preventative medicine” mean? We should read these words in the context of the last paragraph of the excerpt above: “These special powers were used for the first time during the response to COVID-19.” Note the big scary attention-seeking capital letters “COVID” is used when the rest of the world has long moved on to use the more appropriate typography of “Covid” or “covid.” Safe and effective medicines have been discouraged and/or banned since 2020 for treating covid, which was essentially the seasonal flu rebranded. Medicines such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were banned and the use of vitamins D and C, and Zinc were discouraged. The only “medicine” that was allowed was either harmful drugs such as remdesivir and midazolam, and later the so-called vaccines. We can assume then, that because “emergency powers” to coerce people into having the covid injections were used for the first time “during the response to COVID-19,” then the “preventative medicine” they are referring to is so-called vaccines or something as equally ineffective and harmful. Do you still have some doubts that this is the aim? Well, let’s hear what Dr. Peter Hotez – who is linked to Bill “Vaccinate the World” Gates and his sidekick Tedros the Terrorist – has had to say recently. Related: Dr Cover-up: Tedros Adhanom’s controversial journey to the WHO and WHO Director General Tedros Serving Terrorist Group in Contravention of WHO Values At the end of last month, WHO announced a new project to turbo-charge the development and distribution of mRNA vaccines in poorer countries for, they say, a looming bird flu pandemic. “The UN health agency said the project would be rolled out through the mRNA technology transfer program it established with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) in 2021, at the height of the covid-19 crisis,” Medical Press said. A couple of weeks earlier, Dr. Peter Hotez , a prominent vaccine developer and advocate, called for deploying security forces, including police and military, to counter “anti-vaccine aggression” in the United States. He also suggested that the United Nations and NATO deploy security forces against “anti-vaxxers.” Hotez has links to both Bill Gates and WHO. In May 2007, it was reported that Hotez received $52 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and conduct clinical trials in Brazil for his hookworm vaccine. The year before, in 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation published a press release that stated that the Foundation had committed $68.2 million to help fight neglected tropical diseases of which $13.8 million was dedicated to Hotez’s research. However, in 2021, Hotez denied being financed by Bill Gates . In 2022, WHO showcased Hotez in a video to target “anti-vaccine activism” by blasting those who choose not to be vaccinated for supporting “anti-science aggression.” “Anti-vaccine activism, which I actually call anti-science aggression, has now become a major killing force globally."" - @PeterHotez , Professor and Dean @BCM_TropMed , on the devastating impact of #misinformation and disinformation. pic.twitter.com/ZluiMGJ2gX — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) December 14, 2022 Further reading: As the chorus of “Covid vaccines are unsafe” grows, WHO threatens “anti-vaccine activists” and labels unvaccinated a “major killing force” During an interview on 5 July 2024 at the Simposio Internacional de Actualización en Pediatría (International Symposium of Paediatric Updates) in Cartagena, Colombia, Hotez said: What I’ve said to the Biden administration is, the health sector can’t solve this on its own. We’re going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this. I’ve said the same with – I met with Dr. Tedros [director general of the WHO] last month … to say, I don’t know that the World Health Organisation can solve this on our own. We need the other United Nations agencies. NATO. This is a security problem because it’s no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression. And so, this is now a lethal force … and now I feel as a paediatric vaccine scientist … it’s important, just as important for me to make new vaccines, to save lives. The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression. Vaccine Advocate Peter Hotez Calls for Use of Police, Military Against ‘Anti-vaccine Aggression ’ , The Defender, 26 July 2024 Further reading: The Militarisation of Public Health: Dr. Hotez’s Controversial Call to Arms , GreenMedInfo, 29 July 2024 The Gates/WHO puppet is talking about using NATO, a political and military alliance of 32 countries, to enforce vaccine uptake. New Zealand is implementing the enforcement of “preventative medicine” using the police. That similar methods of forced vaccination are being spoken about or included in national plans is no coincidence. The question everyone should be asking is why do they feel the need to force vaccinate populations using law enforcement and even the military. It is because their vaccines are unsafe and ineffective. So much so that few are willing to risk their lives by allowing themselves to be injected and will resist in every way they can. The pandemic-vaccine industry knows we will not be tricked by their psychological operations again and our pushback against government vaccination policies will be even stronger the next time around.

The findings of these two scientists closely resemble what Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, found when he reported on these embalmer clots back in January 2022. (Be sure to check out this report highlighting the footlong clots found in some fully vaccinated dead bodies.) What Adams apparently found concerning these clots is that they are not composed of actual human tissue, nor do they contain amyloid proteins, according to Dr. Ruby – so what are they, exactly? One person on X suggested that perhaps the clots are made up of one prion and two amyloid proteins that were broken up and released by the spike proteins upon being attacked by the immune system. ""The clots are the amyloids forming chains, however the scary part is the prion,"" this person wrote, citing a spike protein patent. Dr. Ruby opposed this line of thinking by explaining that patents ""are not proof of anything"" but are instead just ""potential."" (Related: Remember when Stew Peters censored Dr. Bryan Ardis on Dr. Ruby's show for questioning the contradictory narrative of the ""Died Suddenly"" film?) Are the fully jabbed becoming WiFi antennae systems to connect to ""the borg?"" In response to Dr. Ruby, someone named ""SonOfEnos"" (@SonsOfEnos_) who claims to be a journalist shared the following video claiming that a ""zombie apocalypse"" is imminent because of what has been injected into the bodies of the fully jabbed: The clots in question apparently contain magnetic graphene that grows in both arteries and veins. In some cases, the resulting clot is upwards of three feet in length and could be used as an antenna system for WiFi signals to connect the fully jabbed to ""the borg."" ""Can you hear a high pitch frequency that increases in amplitude at night?"" the X account that reiterated all of this asked of Dr. Ruby, who confirmed that she is aware of this having ""broke the worldwide story of La Quinta Columna and the graphene oxide as well as the first embalmer report."" Check out the following image showing evidence of many other poisons inside the vials of COVID jabs (it's right below Dr. Ruby's original X tweet): There are many other studies from other countries, one of them is Argentina, made for Lorena Diblasi, who found lots of piosons on the vials, and also selfassembling nanoparticles, at least 1 2022 pic.twitter.com/KCNgzbni6u — VEVEKA (@VEVEKA6) August 7, 2024 ""It's truly alarming that so many people are willing to accept these poisonous injections without questioning the novel and dangerous ingredients inside,"" wrote ""CrazyTruthBot"" (@CrazyTruthBot) about the situation at hand. ""Independent researchers and anti-vaxxers have been sounding the alarm for years, yet the majority remain blind to the risks. These self-assembling nanoparticles are not something to be taken lightly. People need to wake up and demand accountability for what they're putting into our bodies."" Another person shared an anecdote about her fully jabbed daughter who ""had a white clot"" that was very similar to the ones Dr. Ruby is warning self-assemble inside people's bodies.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-olympic-triathletes-hospitalized-after-swimming-river-seine.html,Literal s##t show: Olympic triathletes HOSPITALIZED after swimming in feces-polluted River Seine,"Several Olympic triathletes had been hospitalized after swimming in the polluted and human feces-infested River Seine in Paris. The Seine, long known for its poor water quality, was the venue for the men's, women's and mixed relay triathlon events, and is also set to host the 10-kilometer open water swims from Aug. 8 to 9. Swimming in the Seine has been banned since 1923 due to its human feces-infested polluted water. (Related: Olympic swimmers forced to swim through HUMAN FECES-infested waters in Paris after opening ceremony mocked Christianity .) Several triathletes have been hospitalized after swimming in the Seine. Adrien Briffod of Switzerland, who finished 49th out of 50 participants in the men's triathlon on Aug. 4, immediately became seriously ill with a gastrointestinal infection. Briffod's condition prevented him from competing in the mixed relay the next day for the Swiss team. Swiss triathlete Simon Westermann, who was supposed to replace Briffod at the mixed relay, also came down with a stomach infection. Claire Michel of Belgium was also hospitalized with E. coli infection after finishing 38th in the women's triathlon event. This led to Belgium's withdrawal from the mixed relay due to the inability to find a replacement for Michel, who had been ill for four days. Norwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn also fell ill after finishing 17th in the men's triathlon event. The upcoming 10-km open water swim events scheduled on Aug. 8 and 9 in the Seine are now under scrutiny. The organizers canceled practice sessions two days before the event and an alternative venue at Vaires-sur-Marne on the River Marne east of Paris is on standby. The site was recently used to host rowing events. Meanwhile, the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee (BOIC) released a statement expressing concern over the safety conditions. ""The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions. We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not lead to uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans,"" the statement read. Paris and Olympic officials insist the Seine is ""athlete-safe"" Apparently, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and the Olympic organizers were more interested in ""showing off"" the city than protecting the health of athletes from across the world. In fact, France had invested approximately 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to clean up the Seine in preparation for the Olympics , with daily bacteria contamination tests conducted before each triathlon race. Additionally, Paris officials introduced a massive underground water storage basin near the Austerlitz train station to collect rainwater and prevent waste from entering the Seine in May. However, daily water tests in June still revealed unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria . The situation worsened in early July when an opening ceremony rehearsal was canceled due to high fecal bacteria levels after weeks of heavy rain had caused the river to swell up to five times its usual level. Still, French officials made symbolic swims in the river last month. Hidalgo, along with Minister of Sports and Olympic and Paralympic Games Amelie Oudea-Castera, dipped in the water to show confidence that the river is safe. Jolien Vermeylen, Michel's teammate, expressed her dismay right after the race . ""I drank a lot of water,"" she said. ""It doesn't taste like Coca-Cola or Sprite, of course. While swimming under the bridge, I felt and saw things that we shouldn’t think about too much. The Seine has been dirty for a hundred years , so they can't say that the safety of the athletes is a priority. That's b-------.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-ioc-claims-biological-male-boxers-real-victims.html,ABSURD: IOC claims the two XY chromosome boxers who beat up women in the Olympics are the real victims,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has claimed that the two XY-chromosome boxers who beat their biological female opponents at the 2024 Paris Olympics are the real victims . The IOC defended its decision to allow boxers Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan to compete in the Games despite a gender row, claiming that they are facing ""aggression because of an arbitrary decision."" Khelif won his bout over Italian Angela Carini in the welterweight division in 46 seconds on Aug. 1. The following day, Lin defeated Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova in the featherweight division by unanimous decision – allowing the Taiwanese to advance to the quarterfinals. The two fighters have been under fire in the past few days over their gender identity. Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships organized by the International Boxing Association (IBA). Lin and Khelif reportedly failed the IBA's eligibility rules, which bar athletes with male XY chromosomes from participating in women's events. (Related: World Athletics bans transgender athletes from competing in female category at international events .) ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision,"" the IOC said in a statement. ""The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving. Every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination."" But from the looks of things, Carini is more justified to be called a victim of aggression. During the Aug. 1 competition, Khelif delivered two powerful punches to the head that hurt the Italian despite the presence of protective gear. According to Carini, the punches from Khelif ""hurt too much,"" adding that she has never been hit so hard. Following the 46-second bout, the Italian boxer could be heard in the ring telling her coach that ""it's not right."" IBA defends decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin The IOC, which categorizes boxers as men or women based on their passport, pointed its finger at the IBA for the vitriol being received by Khelif and Lin. According to Reuters , the IBA was stripped of its recognition by the IOC last year over governance and finance issues – leading to the IOC running the boxing events in France. ""These two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Toward the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process. According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA Secretary General and CEO [Chris Roberts],"" said the IOC. ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision which was taken without any proper procedure – especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years."" According to the IOC, the rules of eligibility were based on those of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 and cannot be changed during a match. Meanwhile, the IBA criticized ""inconsistencies in eligibility"" at the Paris Olympics in a statement. It also defended the decision to exclude Khelif and Lin, arguing that the two fell short of the association's eligibility requirements. ""Both Khelif and Lin post-testing did not meet the required eligibility criteria to compete within the female category of our respective events,"" the IBA stated. ""The urgent nature of the decision [to disqualify the boxers] was justified, as the safety of our boxers is our top priority."" Follow Transhumanism.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-mrna-vaccines-dont-degrade-create-igg-antibodies.html,The mRNA vaccines do NOT readily degrade and ultimately create IgG and IgM antibodies against lipid nanoparticles,"A July 27 preprint study provides new insights into the failure of Moderna’s SPIKEVAX COVID-19 vaccine. The study shows that the mRNA and lipid nano-particle components of the vaccine can linger in the bloodstream for up to 28 days post-vaccination and generate IgG and IgM antibodies against lipid nanoparticles, skewing the vaccine's efficacy and causing potential adverse events. This revelation has sparked calls for government agencies and vaccine developers to explain the lack of comprehensive pharmacokinetic studies . Pharmacokinetics is the study of how the body processes a substance over time, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The vaccine industry and government regulators had previously advised that the vaccine’s mRNA components would quickly degrade in the deltoid muscle after injection. This process cannot be guaranteed and has implications for long term adverse events and damages to the immune system of tens of millions of people. Vaccine ingredients linger 28 days after injection, forcing immune cells to resist lipid nanoparticles such as polyethylene glycol The study tracked Moderna’s vaccine components in 19 individuals over a 28-day time frame. The study found specific ionizable lipid (SM-102) particles in blood samples within four hours of injection. The level of these components peaked between one and two days after injection. In most of the vaccinated individuals, the mRNA was detected 14 to 28 days after injection. Lipid nanoparticles sometimes remained intact and continued to recirculate in the bloodstream at the same decay rate as the mRNA. This contributed to an increase in antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of the lipid nanoparticles. This means the vaccine trains the immune cells to attack PEG, leading to immune deficits against actual infectious viruses and bacteria. The researchers measured a 1.4 times increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and a 4.6 times increase in IgM antibodies -- which is not a proper immune response. This measurement indicated that the immune cells are responding to the vaccine delivery system and are not relaying immunity to any pathogen. This study builds upon previous research in 2023 which showed mRNA vaccine components circulating in the blood up to 28 days post injection. Likewise, a Japanese bio-distribution study found the particles getting into the brain. Previous studies also warn against immune cells being programmed to attack PEG, and its devastating implications for allergic and autoimmune issues when PEG is injected once more in the future. The study focused solely on blood samples without exploring other tissues and organ systems. It’s crucial to understand that the mere presence of mRNA and lipid nanoparticles in the blood could lead to further issues in the body and across organ systems. How do these foreign particles interfere with hormonal processes and blood circulation? How might the body mount an autoimmune attack against these foreign particles, leading to blood clots or allergic reactions? The level of persisting nanoparticles in a patient’s blood may come down to the way the vaccine is administered in the arm The level of mRNA and nanoparticles in the blood may be determined by improper administration of the vaccine in the arm. If the vaccine is properly administered intramuscularly, then approximately .1% of the components may leak into the blood and travel throughout the body. However, in some patients, the vaccine is injected directly into the blood, leading to a higher concentration of unresolved mRNA and lipid nanoparticles circulating in the blood for days or weeks post injection. “This is a numbers game,” said Michael Palmer, a member of Doctors for COVID Ethics. “It seems quite possible that this unfortunate group of patients are the ones suffering severe side effects.” Dr. McCullough and others expert witnesses are demanding answers and accountability on the issue. McCullough said pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies “should have been done in 2020 as part of Operation Warp Speed.” The absence of thorough pharmacokinetic studies on COVID-19 vaccines — especially considering their rapid development and deployment — represents a glaring failure of oversight. Government agencies and vaccine developers have a fundamental responsibility to conduct these studies to ensure not just efficacy but also safety. Instead, they opted for ‘surrogate’ data, glossing over vital concerns about immune failure, autoimmunity, and antibody dependent enhancement. This lapse has left the public with more questions than answers, undermining trust in the very institutions that should be ensuring our safety. Vaccine developers and regulatory agencies must remove untested vaccines from the marketplace and transparently address these concerns, while providing clear, scientifically validated explanations.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-scientists-discover-use-of-nanoparticles-to-control-emotions.html,"South Korean scientists discover how to use nanoparticles to control emotions, appetite via external magnetic field","Globalist-""sponsored"" scientists are so obsessed with controlling the mind that they conducted a study where a remote magnet would be able to manipulate the brain – even one's appetite – without any invasive procedure performed. Researchers at South Korea's Institute for Basic Science (IBS) are in the very early stages of development of hardware that utilizes nanoparticles to control the minds of mice. It is a brain remote control that they claimed is ""long-range"" and ""large-volume"" and switches using magnetic fields. According to the ""science experts,"" the technology dubbed Nano-MIND (Magnetogenetic Interface for NeuroDynamics), allowed researchers to control the emotions and appetites of mice from afar and could be used to treat neurological disorders like depression. They tested the ""innovation"" by inducing ""maternal"" instincts in their female test subjects. In another test, the researchers exposed a test group of lab mice to magnetic fields designed to reduce appetite, leading to a 10-percent loss in body weight, or about 4.3 grams. The scientists manipulated a complex network of over 100 billion neurons by magnetically twisting a tiny actuator to pull or push nanoparticles implanted in the mice's brains. According to studies, this network is crucial for understanding cognition, emotion and social behavior. ""This is the world's first technology to freely control specific brain regions using magnetic fields,"" said Dr. Cheon Jinwoo, director of South Korea's IBS Center, who helped spearhead the new effort. ""We expect it to be widely used in research to understand brain functions, sophisticated artificial neural networks, two-way brain-computer interface technologies, and new treatments for neurological disorders."" There have been numerous ""mind control"" experiments on animals over the years, the Sun reported, ""But this is the first that hasn't involved invasive surgery and bulky external systems, which has instead allowed mice the freedom of movement."" In an op-ed that came with the said study published in Nature Nanotechnology , senior scientist at Spain's Instituto de Neurociencias Dr. Felix Leroy said that the concept of using magnetic fields to manipulate biological systems has been well established. ""It has been applied in various fields,"" he noted, ""like in magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment."" However, he cautioned against rushing too soon to human testing . ""Further studies are needed to assess potential cumulative effects, including neuroadaptation or neurotoxicity,"" Leroy advised. A nanoparticle is a small particle that ranges between one to 100 nanometres in size, which is undetectable by the human eye and even smaller than the wavelengths of visible light which are between 400 and 700 nanometres. A special electron microscope or microscope with lasers is needed to observe them. Studies involving nanoparticles are branches of nanotechnology that is famously relied upon by the fictional Marvel character Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Korean, U.S. scientists create a brain implant that could be controlled using a smartphone In a separate effort by South Korea and the United States, supported by grants from the National Research Foundation of Korea, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Mallinckrodt Professorship, another innovation was tested to control the brain. A soft neural implant, capable of delivering multiple drugs and color lights, was discovered to manipulate neural circuits using a smartphone. In the study that was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering , the researchers said the tiny implant is the first wireless neural device capable of speeding up efforts to uncover brain diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, addiction, depression and pain. ""The wireless neural device enables chronic chemical and optical neuromodulation that has never been achieved before,"" said lead author Raza Qazi, a researcher with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder . Co-author Michael Bruchas, a professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine and pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine , said this technology allowed them to better dissect the neural circuit basis of behavior ""and how specific neuromodulators in the brain tune behavior in various ways,"" he said. ""We are also eager to use the device for complex pharmacological studies, which could help us develop new therapeutics for pain, addiction, and emotional disorders."" The device uses Lego-like replaceable drug cartridges and powerful Bluetooth low-energy to deliver drugs and light to specific neurons of interest. According to the scientists, this technology significantly overshadows conventional neuroscience methods, which usually involve rigid metal tubes and optical fibers. Though some efforts have addressed adverse tissue response by incorporating soft probes and wireless platforms, the previous solutions were limited by their inability to deliver drugs for long periods as well as their bulky and complex control setups. Controlled with a simple user interface on a smartphone, the device can create a specific combination or precise sequencing of light and drug deliveries in any implanted target animal without the need to be inside the laboratory. With this device, researchers could easily set up fully automated animal studies where the behavior of one animal could positively or negatively affect behavior in other animals by conditional triggering of light and/or drug delivery. ""This revolutionary device is the fruit of advanced electronics design and powerful micro and nanoscale engineering,"" said Jae-Woong Jeong, a professor of electrical engineering at KAIST.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-vtsc-school-immune-lawsuit-vaccinating-child-covid.html,Vermont Supreme Court: Parents CAN’T SUE school for injecting 6-year-old with COVID-19 vaccine without their consent,"The Vermont Supreme Court (VTSC) has ruled that the parents of a six-year-old boy cannot sue a school after the child was illegally injected with a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. In its July 26 decision, the highest court of the Green Mountain State rejected the lawsuit filed by the parents of six-year-old L.P. against the Windham Southeast School District (WSESD). This is because state officials, including officials in the public school system, are protected from liability under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act of 2005. The PREP Act signed into law by former President George W. Bush ensures certain ""covered persons"" are immune from claims causally related to the use of a ""covered countermeasure"" during a public health emergency. A vaccine is considered a covered countermeasure under this law. ""To avoid dismissal on immunity grounds, plaintiffs would have had to present well-pleaded allegations showing that (1) at least one defendant was not a covered person, (2) some conduct by a defendant was not causally related to administering a covered countermeasure, (3) the substance injected into L.P. was not a covered countermeasure, or (4) there was no PREP Act declaration in effect at the time L.P. was injected,"" the ruling read. (Related: PREP Act passed in 2020 was designed to protect everyone EXCEPT those injured by vaccines. ) According to FOX 26 , L.P. was injected with the COVID-19 vaccine during the November 2021 clinic hosted by the WSESD and the Vermont Department of Health . L.P.'s father told school officials days before the clinic that his son was not to be vaccinated. Despite the school acknowledging the directive, the six-year-old child was given one dose of Pfizer's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after erroneously given the name tag of a child with no such restriction. School officials apologized to the child's parents It was only later that school officials eventually realized the error and called L.P.'s parents to apologize. But this failed to assuage the boy's parents, who later removed their child from the WSESD school. ""Thankfully, we are not aware of any harm to the student because of this mistake,"" WSESD Superintendent Mark Speno said in a 2021 apology letter. ""We take our responsibilities to students and families very seriously, and we respect parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their children."" L.P.'s parents eventually took the school district to court, but the high court ruled in favor of the defendants, citing the PREP Act. The VTSC's ruling affirms an earlier decision by a state superior court in January of last year , LifeSiteNews reported. ""Near the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, the Trump administration invoked the Act in declaring the virus a 'public health emergency,'"" the pro-life news outlet stated. ""A large body of evidence identifies significant risks to the COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed and reviewed in a fraction of the time vaccines usually take under former President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed initiative."" Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention point out the injuries caused by the COVID-19 injections . Researchers from the public health agency have recognized a ""high verification rate"" of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 injections. This led the researchers to conclude that ""under-reporting is more likely"" than over-reporting. Watch this clip about the excess death of kids in America and the healthcare system .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-teens-with-psu-likely-experience-anxiety-depression.html,Study: Teens with “problematic smartphone use” more likely to experience anxiety and depression,"Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IOPPN) at King's College London have warned that teenagers who show symptoms of "" problematic smartphone use "" (PSU) are more likely to experience anxiety and depression. PSU refers to a large range of behaviors and emotions similar to addiction . This includes anxiety or distress when without a phone, difficulty in limiting phone use, prolonged use without satisfaction and neglecting other enjoyable or meaningful activities in favor of phone use. IOPPN researchers conducted two significant studies to investigate the relationship between PSU and mental health in adolescents. The first study published in Acta Paediatrica involved 16- to 18-year-olds from five secondary schools across England. It revealed that ""teens reporting PSU were twice as likely to experience anxiety and nearly three times as likely to experience depression compared to those who did not report PSU."" The second study published in the journal BMJ Mental Health focused on 13- to 16-year-olds from two secondary schools in London. It found that 44.4 percent with PSU experienced anxiety symptoms, compared to 26.4 percent of those without PSU. Additionally, 55.6 percent of teens with PSU reported symptoms of depression, compared to 35.8 percent of their peers without PSU. This study also monitored PSU's impact over time, showing that increases in PSU scores over four weeks were associated with higher levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and insomnia. These pioneering studies evaluated the link between PSU and mental health outcomes in adolescents, finding that 18.7 percent of 16- to 18-year-olds and 14.5 percent of 13- to 16-year-olds reported PSU – with higher rates among girls. Both studies indicated that many young people were aware of their excessive smartphone use and wished to reduce it. Nearly two-thirds of 16- to 18-year-olds had tried to cut down, with one in eight seeking help. Teens with PSU were five times more likely to want help compared to their peers. Similarly, almost 90 percent of 13- to 16-year-olds had tried strategies to limit their use, such as silencing notifications. The researchers noted that adolescents were aware of the need to manage their smartphone use and were open to setting boundaries. How to encourage healthy phone habits in teens Parenting expert and award-winning author Jessica Speer highlighted how parents can help prevent their teenager children from developing unhealthy smartphone habits . Teens today are simply growing up in an era dominated by digital technology. Phones help them connect with friends, explore identities, find entertainment, seek validation and stay informed. Parents are encouraged to recognize that teens are navigating a digital world not designed with their well-being in mind . Approach conversations about screen time with empathy and set boundaries together. If phone use is affecting the daily life, sleep schedule or well-being of teenagers, parents are encouraged to update family tech usage rules through calm and open discussions with children to help come up with agreeable solutions. This could mean establishing communal charging stations at night, limiting platforms or reducing phone time. While technology has its drawbacks, it also offers benefits. Discuss both sides with teenagers and share personal experiences, such as needing to check phones often or relying on apps for certain tasks like driving. These conversations can help teenagers understand how to navigate the digital world more effectively.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-biden-fda-puberty-blockers-minors-depression-suicide.html,EXPOSED: Biden’s FDA pushed dangerous puberty blockers on minors even though drugs “increased risk of depression and suicidality”,"An email has come to light that exposes an even greater level of evil within the Biden regime than was previously believed. The short of it is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a recommendation that underage children take puberty blockers for LGBT transitions, even though the agency knew full well that the drugs ""increased risk of depression and suicidality"" in minors. Officially, the Biden regime does not even try to hide its support for minors taking LGBT pharmaceuticals in order to ""become themselves."" Their claim, though, is that these drugs are safe for children, which we now know to be untrue. Not only is it untrue that puberty blockers are extremely dangerous for kids, but the FDA under Biden knew this when it issued its recommendation in support of them. Shannon Sullivan, a ""Clinical Team Leader"" in the Division of General Endocrinology at the FDA, admitted this in a now-unearthed email, dated Jan. 25, 2022, to fellow FDA employee Theresa Kehoe. Sullivan explained to Kehoe in the email that a safety review on the GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonist class of puberty blockers, which prevent the natural release of testosterone and estrogen in developing children, had been conducted in 2016 and 2017. The review found that this particular class of puberty-blocking drugs causes a host of serious health problems both in children and adults. ""The complaints were extensive and variable, and included fibromyalgia type symptoms, infertility, PCOS, and weight gain, among others,"" Sullivan wrote about the long-term effects of GnRH agonists in adults with histories of this type of drug use. Since the review Sullivan referenced focused primarily on suicidal ideation, depression, seizures and bone health, she would go on to reveal that the effects of puberty blockers in young children are even worse. ""We did find increased risk of depression and suicidality, as well as increased seizure risk and we issued SLCs to the entire class for these AEs (added to W&P in 2017)."" Just one paragraph later, Sullivan reiterated the fact that puberty blockers are profoundly dangerous for children, but proceeds to recommend them anyway. ""... there is definitely a need for these drugs to be approved for gender transition,"" Sullivan wrote, adding that one of the many reasons for this is that puberty blockers ""are typically not covered by insurance and are expensive out of pocket."" In other words, Sullivan's view seems to be that puberty blockers are admittedly dangerous but pre-pubescent children should definitely still get them with full approval from the FDA. (Related: Did you know that during the Wuhan coronavirus [covid-19] ""pandemic,"" Biden also ordered Amazon to hide all books critical of vaccines?) Transgender abominations Sullivan's email came to light thanks to the discovery process in a lawsuit filed by America First Legal (AFL), a conservative nonprofit group. AFL initiated the lawsuit in response to the FDA illegally concealing records related to the off-label use of puberty blockers by transgenders. AFL filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to obtain these records. When the FDA refused to comply by the legal deadline, AFL sued the federal agency. AFL senior adviser Ian Prior said that what the FDA is doing to children under Biden is nothing short of abominable. ""It is shocking and unacceptable that the FDA would admit that puberty blockers cause suicidal ideation and depression, yet in the same breath recommend their approval for transgender 'medical' procedures for children,"" he said. ""The advocates of these brutal practices on children claim that they are necessary to prevent suicide and depression, but in reality, the treatments themselves cause the very thing they claim they are trying to prevent. This barbarism has no place in a civilized society and it's time for the federal government to follow the lead of Europe in banning these experiments on children."" The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which claims to be the world's premiere source for information about ""gender-affirming care,"" admits in its own internal documents that the medical ""treatments"" children who want to become transgender under come with serious side effects like liver cancer and reduced or destroyed sexual function. This class of drugs is so damaging to the body that it is also used to chemically castrate sex offenders. Yes, the same punishment delivered to society's most evil is now being used as ""medicine"" to transition mere babes into transgender abominations. ""Anybody with a functioning mind understands that government regulatory agencies are captured activists,"" wrote ""Implicit Truths"" (@CrayCrayBlocker) on X about not just the FDA but the entirety of Washington, D.C., and how it really operates behind the scenes. Another pointed out that most of the pharmaceutical drugs marketed for children these days come with a high risk of depression and suicidality, almost like they want to destroy children with these poison ""medicines."" ""Investigate, prosecute, hold a trial, obtain a conviction, and set a punishment,"" added ""Dangerous Thoughts"" (@dangerousthinkg) to the X conversation. ""No punishment is too severe for people who would knowingly mistreat children!"" Someone named Ted Poulos (@TedPoulos) addressed Shannon and the FDA directly, writing that they are ""sick in the head and should immediately be prosecuted for deliberate malpractice and irreversible damage to children and adults with these pharma poisons and suicide ideation-production narcotics."" The sins of modern-day America, including the transgender push on children, are even worse than those of now-destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Learn more at Evil.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-people-resisted-medical-tyranny-now-winning-lawsuits.html,People who RESISTED medical tyranny are now WINNING religious exemption lawsuits,"Two courts recently ruled in favor of plaintiffs who were not granted their religious exemption requests on vaccine requirements, adding to a string of recent victories over dangerous inoculation mandates. Since May, at least 10 appellate courts have issued decisions in favor of employees who sued their employers over Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) religious or moral exemptions actions or policies. (Related: Connecticut claims religious exemptions to mandatory child vaccinations somehow pose a threat to public health .) In April 2022, Rachel Spivack sued her former boss, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, for violating her First Amendment rights and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Religious Freedom Protection Act. Krasner's office issued a vaccine mandate for all eligible employees in August 2021, about a month before Spivack, a non-unionized employee, began working there. Spivack sought a religious exemption based on her Orthodox Jewish beliefs, submitting a letter from her rabbi and providing a detailed explanation of her religious beliefs, but Krasner ignored her request for COVID-19 vaccine exemption while allowing other types of exemptions . According to the DA's office, they changed policy between August 2021 and January 2022, deciding to categorically deny all religious exemptions without individual assessment. However, his policy did allow a medical exemption for one employee and exemptions for unionized employees whose terms of employment are governed by their union contracts with the city rather than with his office. Spivack still attempted to work with the office to find ways to keep her job without getting vaccinated, offering to mask and test weekly, but the office refused and terminated her employment on April 8, 2022. She sued Krasner and the city later that month. The District Court that first heard the case granted Krasner's motion for summary judgment, saying there was no evidence his decision was based on religious intolerance. But on July 29, the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit reversed the decision and sent the case back for trial. A reasonable jury could find that Krasner's comments ""evince hostility toward religion that undermines"" the neutrality of his office's policies, or it could also reach the opposite conclusion, the ruling said. Therefore, ""neither party is entitled to summary judgment on neutrality"" and the case should be heard by a jury. ""We are grateful that the Appeals Court recognized that these important issues deserve a jury's consideration,” Lea Patterson, who represented Spivack in court, said in a press release. ""No American should lose her job for living according to her sincerely held religious beliefs."" Connecticut Supreme Court rules in favor of religious exemptions Meanwhile, the Connecticut Supreme Court sent a case challenging Connecticut's school vaccine religious exemption policy back to the Superior Court for further review in relation to the state's Religious Freedom and Restoration Act. In 2021, parents Keira Spillane and Anna Kehle sued the governor, the heads of the state's Education and Public Health departments, and a local school and board of education, arguing that the policy violated their and their children's rights to freely exercise religion, to equal protection of the laws and to free public education. The defendants appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which reversed part of the lower court's decision, dismissing five of six counts against the plaintiffs and allowing the school vaccination mandate to remain in place. However, it sent the case back to the Superior Court to review the plaintiffs' claims. ""This decision is a victory for our plaintiffs and a victory for religious freedom in Connecticut and we look forward to pressing ahead with our injunction motion so that we can get these disenfranchised children back to school while we await our trial,"" said Brian Marks, professor of law and public health at the University of New Haven School of Health Sciences.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-07-hospital-sued-kidnapping-transitioning-boy-with-autism.html,Hospital SUED for kidnapping a boy with autism and facilitating his TRANSITION despite family’s disapproval,"The Children's National Hospital (CNH) in Washington, D.C. is now facing a lawsuit for taking away a 16-year-old boy with autism from his family. According to the family – whose identity was withheld upon request – the boy was sent to CNH in November 2021 after he attempted to end his life when his girlfriend broke up with him. It came as a surprise that the boy suddenly expressed wanting to be identified as a female when he was in the hospital. The lawsuit accused CNH of a ""full-on campaign to transgender this child"" with ""mental re-programming,"" including sending letters to friends declaring he is now a female. According to the lawsuit, the medical facility diagnosed the child with gender dysphoria and held him for 41 days. The institution also moved him to foster services instead of releasing him to his parents. What worried the family more was that the single foster mother who took him had a previous assault charge. She was also alleged to be a close friend of Lavender Kelley, the hospital's activist ""non-gendered"" chaplain. When the son once again attempted to commit suicide the following year, he came back to the hospital, but this time identifying as a girl. ""We had never known of our son's purported desire or plan to change genders,"" the family said. ""Rather than treating us as patrons with legal and dignitary rights, the defendant… treated the parents as though they had harmed their son, even though the parents had never endangered their child and had home-schooled him to college entry at fourteen years old."" ""At [CNH], it is as if all critical reasoning toward the child was suspended, and there was no investigation into the extent that the child was lying,"" the lawsuit further indicated. The family is seeking a trial by jury and $100 million in damages to compensate for the hefty legal expenses they have accrued fighting for their son. The family had no choice but to sell their home and a ""thriving"" business to keep up with the expenses. ""This is the craziest case I've ever had,"" said attorney Amos Jones, who is representing the parents. ""I don't know why there are people who think this makes sense. But I guess lots of people agree with this in Washington D.C. now."" Studies: Kids outgrow gender dysphoria by late adolescence According to various studies, more than 80 percent of children suffering from gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and the gender alteration procedures would only fail to resolve the teenagers' tendency to self-harm and commit suicide. InfoWars reported another landmark 15-year study that found most trans children grow out of their gender confusion by the time they are fully grown adults. The Dutch researchers tracked 2,700 children from 11 years old until their mid-twenties, asking about their gender every three years. (Related: Study: Most gender-confused children OUTGROW gender dysphoria during adulthood .) Published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior , the paper said 11 percent of the respondents expressed ""gender non-contentedness"" to varying degrees. But upon reaching the age 25, just four percent said they were often or sometimes unhappy with their gender. ""The results of the current study might help adolescents to realize that it is normal to have some doubts about one's identity and one's gender identity during this age period and that this is also relatively common,"" the researchers concluded. ""Gender non-contentedness, while being relatively common during early adolescence, in general, decreases with age and appears to be associated with a poorer self-concept and mental health throughout development.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-06-living-near-pesticide-spraying-farms-is-equally-carcinogenic-as-smoking.html,Living near pesticide-spraying farms is equally carcinogenic as SMOKING,"A shocking new study published in the journal Frontiers in Cancer Control and Society reveals that individuals living in U.S. agricultural communities where pesticides are sprayed face a cancer risk comparable to that of smokers. This new research highlights the significant health risks posed by agricultural chemicals even to people who are not directly involved in farming. This research has significant implications for young, developing children living in rural communities. Smoking is a habit that is chosen later in life. Children may be subjected to a similar level of carcinogens much earlier in life, and it’s not their choice to be subjected to these toxins. These agricultural chemicals are one of the driving forces behind the chronic disease epidemic plaguing U.S. children. Increasing pesticide exposure correlated with increases in various cancer types, including leukemia The study, conducted by a team of researchers from Rocky Vista University, analyzed cancer incidence data from nearly every county in the U.S. and compared it to federal data on agricultural pesticide use. The study's authors analyzed data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for 69 pesticides and cross-referenced this with cancer data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The research uncovered a higher risk of cancer in areas with extensive pesticide use, contradicting initial assumptions that only direct exposure would significantly affect cancer rates. Instead, the findings indicate a troubling correlation: the higher the pesticide usage, the higher the risk of developing various types of cancer, including leukemia, bladder, colon, lung, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and pancreatic cancer. ""Agricultural pesticide usage has a significant impact on all the cancer types evaluated in this study,"" the authors state, noting that these associations are especially pronounced in regions with high agricultural productivity. The study's authors emphasize that pesticide-related cancer risks are on par with those associated with smoking cigarettes, which contain at least 70 different carcinogens. Dana Barr, an environmental health researcher at Emory University not involved in the study, expressed concern about current U.S. pesticide regulations. ""Right now, I don’t think the regulations for pesticides are the most health-protective,"" Barr said. ""We need policy reform that puts the onus on the manufacturers to do a better job of evaluating safety before allowing new registrations."" Cancer risks highest in Midwest, correlated with dicamba- and glyphosate-based weedkillers Isain Zapata, an associate professor at Rocky Vista University and one of the study’s authors, expressed surprise at the findings. ""We naively thought some of the cancer rates would not be affected,"" he said. ""But it doesn’t affect only people that are exposed directly while working with pesticides."" Zapata and his team used statistical analysis to map patterns of pesticide use and their correlation with cancer rates, finding the highest risks in states known for large-scale corn production, such as Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri, Indiana and Ohio. The researchers also identified specific chemicals that contributed significantly to cancer risks. For example, chlorpyrifos, paraquat and atrazine are all linked to kidney cancer and endocrine disruption . Organophosphates are linked to fertility decline in men . Glyphosate, the widely-used herbicide and the active ingredient in Roundup, has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and has since been associated with increased risks for several types of cancer . In a 2020 NIH study , dicamba was linked to higher risks of colon and pancreatic cancer. In February, a federal judge banned dicamba-based weedkillers produced by major manufacturers, ruling that the EPA had unlawfully permitted their use. Despite these regulatory actions, the new study highlights a broader, nationwide issue with pesticide use and its health impacts. The entire agricultural system in the United States desperately needs to be reconfigured and weaned from widespread use of cancer-causing pesticides and herbicides. The cancer epidemic can only be addressed if the pesticide manufacturers are prosecuted -- their carcinogens replaced with formulas and methods that are non-toxic. Setting up new regulatory frameworks that permit the use of these chemicals at smaller doses only gives these companies more power to slowly kill us off. New regulations will make these poisoners and polluters appear restrained, but they will continue to profit from human suffering.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-06-missouri-ag-investigating-gym-male-womens-spaces.html,Missouri AG opens investigation into gym for allowing biological male to use women’s private spaces,"Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has initiated an investigation into Life Time Fitness in Ellisville after constituents notified him that the gym was allowing a biological male to use spaces reserved for women and girls. ""BREAKING: I have launched an investigation into Life Time Fitness for allowing a biological male into women’s locker rooms. The gym faces potential criminal AND civil liability for putting Missouri’s women and girls in harm’s way. I am issuing subpoenas,"" Bailey wrote in a post on his X account. Bailey said he immediately put the gym on notice that they face both possible criminal and civil liability for placing women and girls in harm’s way. ""It has come to my attention that Life Time Fitness has proudly adopted a policy that permits biological men to use locker rooms designated specifically for women and young girls,"" Bailey said in the notice of investigation. ""Even more concerning is the fact that instead of taking the safety concerns from your gym members seriously, you rudely correct them and insist they call this biological male by the 'correct pronouns,' "" Bailey continued. ""While it might be considered fashionable in certain corporate boardrooms to pretend that biology is irrelevant, the American heartland still lives in reality."" Bailey went on to say that ""Missourians recognize that allowing adult men to openly invade and disrobe in spaces set aside for women and young girls is indefensible and places political correctness above public safety. That is why I am putting you on notice that you are under investigation."" ""If you insist on endangering women and young girls in our state, in open defiance of the law, be assured you will face the consequences,"" Bailey warned. The individual in question joined the gym on July 28. By Aug. 2, Republican State Rep. Justin Sparks had begun holding press conferences outside the gym and gathering protesters to denounce the fitness center . Life Time spokesperson Natalie Bushaw said gym personnel asked for a copy of the individual's driver's license, which identified the person as female. Bushaw told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that a woman approached her in the sauna on July 29, and said she was a man and that she did not belong there. ""The Missouri Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Therefore, the member is to use Life Time's women's locker room,"" Bushaw declared in a statement. (Related: WOKE CULT: CVS tells employees to use whatever restroom or locker room ""that is appropriate to the gender they identify with"" – and other woke insanities .) Missouri has no law about transgender people's access to public restrooms Missouri has not legislated a law about transgender people's access to public restrooms, and the state's attorney general has restricted authority to push criminal charges which is usually left to local prosecutors. Bailey mentioned a 2015 Missouri appeals court ruling against a man convicted of misdemeanor trespassing in a women's gas station restroom. The man in that case hid in a women's gas station bathroom and smoked cigarettes for hours. He did not claim to be a woman or transgender, but he tried to disguise his voice when an employee requested him to stop smoking. ""Appellant responded that he had to defecate 'really bad,'"" the ruling stated. He was holding a lotion and a pornographic magazine. As for the Life Time Fitness case, Ellisville police said the agency is not investigating possible trespassing because the private gym granted the member permission to use the women's locker room. It is uncertain if property owners can be prosecuted under Missouri law for permitting trespassing on their property. Follow Transhumanism.news for more stories about transgender issues.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-06-pope-visits-nun-bringing-transgender-individuals-vatican.html,Pope Francis visits nun who brings transgender individuals to the Vatican for papal audiences,"Pope Francis has made an unannounced visit to a French Catholic nun who often brings transgender individuals to the Vatican for papal audiences. The Holy See Press Office confirmed the July 31 visit in a statement issued on the same day. According to the statement, the pontiff met with Sister Genevieve Jeanningros, a member of the Little Sisters of Jesus. Jeanningros has lived among the circus performers in a trailer park in Rome's coastal Ostia town for more than 50 years, and her ministry involves work with circus groups, homeless people and transgender individuals. The pope reportedly arrived in Ostia in the afternoon of July 31, meeting with the nun and blessing and greeting families and children. Footage of the visit shared by Vatican News on social media showed the pontiff alongside Jeanningros, warmly interacting with the community. The circus performers Jeanningros ministers to also put on a show during the event, which the pope enjoyed. Jeanningros, who has maintained a long-standing friendship with the pope, frequently brings groups of transgender individuals to the Vatican for weekly papal audiences. One such group hails from the coastal town of Torvaianica, located near Ostia. The Torvaianica group, which is composed mostly of sex workers, was formed during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic when restrictions left them without income. The group gained the pope's attention after writing to him about their financial struggles. The pontiff responded by directing Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, his almoner (a priest or church officer in charge of distributing tithes to those who need them the most), to provide the group with financial assistance. In 2022, Jeanningros brought a group of transgender women to thank the pope for his support during the pandemic. Recently, she brought groups of homosexuals and transgender individuals from Torvaiacina to meet the pope twice in June. Pope Francis used homophobic slur in closed-door meeting According to LifeSiteNews , Pope Francis had told Sister Jeannine Gramick last fall that ""transgender people must be accepted and integrated into society."" The pontiff's comments to Gramick, a pro-LGBT nun and a member of the Sisters of Loreto, followed a luncheon last November held to commemorate the World Day of the Poor that featured transgender sex workers. (Related: Pope Francis parties with transgender prostitutes in the Vatican to commemorate 'World Day of the Poor.' ) ""I think in the long run, Pope Francis is laying the groundwork for change in sexuality,"" Gramick later remarked. The July 31 visit came months after the pontiff apologized for using a homophobic slur . In May, Italian media reported that Pope Francis used the Italian term ""frociaggine,"" roughly translating to ""faggotness"" or ""faggotry,"" while speaking to Italian bishops in a closed-door meeting. The head of the Catholic Church reportedly uttered the term during the May 20 meeting to reiterate his opposition to accepting gays into priesthood. On May 28, the Vatican clarified that Pope Francis did not intend to use homophobic language. ""The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologized to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,"" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in an emailed statement.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-06-ransomware-blood-bank-hospitals-activate-shortage-protocols.html,Ransomware attack on blood bank forces hundreds of hospitals in southeastern U.S. to activate blood shortage protocols,"OneBlood, a prominent non-profit blood donation center in Florida that serves hundreds of hospitals in the southeastern United States, has been targeted by a ransomware attack . Despite the attack, the organization continues to collect, test and distribute blood but at a ""significantly reduced capacity."" To address the disruptions, the blood bank adopted ""manual processes and procedures to remain operational. However, these manual methods ""take significantly longer to perform and impact inventory availability,"" as explained by Susan Forbes, OneBlood's senior vice president of Corporate Communications and Public Relations. In an effort to manage the blood supply, the more than 250 hospitals served by OneBlood were forced to activate their critical blood shortage protocols. OneBlood is figuring out the full extent of the cyber attack and what effect it has had on the organization's data centers. As of press time, it is still not certain if customers' personal information – such as test results, medical histories and blood types – have been compromised. (Related: HACKING THE HACKERS: FBI, law enforcement agencies from 11 other countries shut down ransomware websites of notorious cybercriminal group .) The attack on OneBlood is just the latest in a series of data breaches affecting the health care sector . Recently, a data breach of Kaiser Permanente is estimated to have affected roughly 13.4 million individuals, and a June report by data security firm SecurityScorecard warned that 34 percent of third-party data breaches in the U.S. in 2023 targeted health care organizations, far ""outpacing every other sector."" Ransomware attack could affect health of thousands of patients in the United States OneBlood provides safe, available and affordable whole blood, platelets and other blood products to hundreds of hospitals across Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The loss of OneBlood's services could affect the health of thousands of patients across the Southeastern United States. ""The blood supply cannot be taken for granted,"" said Forbes. ""The situation we are dealing with is ongoing. If you are eligible to donate, we urge you to please make an appointment to donate as soon as possible."" The situation has become increasingly precarious for OneBlood amid the onset of Hurricane Debby , at a time when OneBlood needs to expedite its processes. ""Manual processes take longer to perform,"" said Forbes. ""We felt the impact of this the most when it came to labeling blood for release to hospitals."" ""Blood drives are taking place, our donor centers have remained open, and we continue to see a tremendous response from OneBlood donors answering the call for blood donations,"" said Forbes. The organization added that there is an urgent need for O positive, O negative and platelet donations. OneBlood has received significant aid from other blood centers across the country led by the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies Task Force, which was formed to protect blood collection efforts in the event of natural disasters or acts of terrorism. To aid in blood collection efforts, OneBlood's 81 blood donation centers in 30 Florida counties are open to accept walk-ins, and the organization's more than 250 ""Big Red Buses"" have been deployed across the state. These buses can often be seen at grocery store and shopping center parking lots, offering coupons, T-shirts and other merchandise to people willing to donate blood and platelets.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-06-liberty-university-sued-by-aclu-fire-trans-woman.html,A set up? Liberty University sued by the ACLU for firing male employee who now identifies as ‘trans woman’,"A former employee has sued Liberty University, alleging that he was “discriminated” against after notifying the school’s human resources department that he now identifies as a woman. (Article by Doug Mainwaring republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) This week, the leftist American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of “trans woman” “Ellenor” Zinski, saying that he was fired in violation of Title VII of the Civil rights Act of 1964. “No one should be fired because of who they are – but Liberty University made it clear that’s exactly why it fired Ellenor,” asserted ACLU of Virginia Senior Transgender Rights Attorney Wyatt Rolla. “Workplace discrimination against transgender people [sic] is against the law, and it’s especially telling that Liberty University sees a practicing Christian’s gender identity as so antithetical to its mission that it was willing to flout the law in order to cast out one of its own.” “Liberty University officials read a termination notice aloud to Ellenor citing ‘denying biological and chromosomal sex assigned at birth’ as the basis for her termination, stating a conflict with Liberty’s Doctrinal Statement that names ‘denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender’ as a ‘sinful act prohibited by God,’” explained an ACLU statement about the case. Zinski was hired by the university in February 2023, then in July, just a few months later, he sent an email informing the school that he identified as a “trans woman,” had been undergoing “hormone replacement therapy” (‘HRT’), and intended to legally change his name from Jonathan to “Ellenor.” “As a result, Liberty terminated Zinski’s employment because his decision to identify as transgender conflicted with the university’s Doctrinal Statement that names ‘denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender’ as a “sinful act prohibited by God,” explained the Washington Stand’s Dan Hart. The fact that Zinski announced his gender “transition” just a few months after beginning his employment at Liberty University has prompted speculation that, rather than a spontaneous move by Zinski, this might be a part of premeditated strategy to force a transgender “discrimination” case into the U.S. court system in order to effect change. “This looks like a set up to me,” observed Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C. in a Washington Watch YouTube post . “Will religious institutions be forced to violate their authentically held, biblically-based beliefs?” asked Perkins. “Fortunately, the law gives a couple of very strong lines of defense for religious organizations,” explained First Liberty Institute Senior Counsel, Stephanie Taub. “The first one is in the Constitution,” said Taub. “And fortunately, we’ve had a couple of very good decisions from the United States Supreme Court that protects religious schools and their right to hire so-called ministers, or people that are responsible for teaching the faith to the next generation as a part of their religious school.” “And there’s also protections in federal employment discrimination law itself, which gives protections for religious employers to make employment decisions based on religion,” continued Taub. “But what we see here is we see radical organizations like the ACLU that are trying to chip away at the rights of religious schools and especially Christian schools and their right to actually remain a community of faith that are dedicated to their doctrinal principles.” “What makes a Christian school a Christian school is its ability to have Christians who adhere to the same doctrinal statements, who are able to work together in a community to achieve a shared mission,” explained Taub. “What you have here with these kinds of lawsuits is the ACLU trying to force Christian schools to accept and maintain employees who are acting out of step with those doctrinal statements, who are contradicting them,” said Taub. “This has the potential to interfere with these religious schools and their ability to effectively fulfill their missions.” Meg Kilgannon, Family Research Council’s senior fellow for Education Studies, confirmed Perkins’ suspicion that the left is using lawfare against religious institutions. “These kinds of efforts seem designed to expand the application of the Bostock decision (a case about employment) in ways that put LGBTQ+ affirmation on a collision course with religious liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution,” Kilgannon told the Stand.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-05-hhs-laying-groundwork-for-fall-winter-pandemic.html,"HHS declares emergency, approves bird flu PCR tests and vaccines, laying groundwork for Fall – Winter pandemic","In the year 2020, governments everywhere laid out the red carpet for a pandemic industry that profits and grows more powerful from human suffering, censorship, fear, medical fraud, isolation and iatrogenic error. Populations witnessed it all: the engineering of a SARS-CoV-2 bioweapon, the mainstream media’s scripted bio-terror campaigns, the lies of asymptomatic superspreaders, the government’s totalitarian COVID-19 response, the censorship of dissenting voices, the suppression of treatments, the money laundering, the rapid escalation of PCR fraud by the medical community, the rise of surveillance, the inhumane isolation protocols, the rapid, militant deployment of remdesivir, ventilators, and harmful, ineffective injections and all the unlawful government edicts and mandates. This is just the beginning of horrors to come. The game-plan for depopulation and the rise of a global bio-terror pandemic dictatorship is laid bare for all to see. Yet, the government and the people's continuous participation in these nefarious schemes will only perpetuate these evils and exploits on American soil. HHS declares emergency, ramps up PCR and vaccine investments for bird flu There hasn’t even been a serious government press conference about the latest DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra recently amended a 2013 section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allowing the agency to extend the availability of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza A viruses, including bird flu strains like H5N1. This means the HHS is allowing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use emergency use authorization (EUA) powers to unleash a new wave of RT-PCR tests and vaccines that will be marketed as the solution for an upcoming strain of bird flu. These predictable, preemptive actions are taking place even as the CDC maintains that the current public health risk for bird flu is low. Why would the government preemptively use instruments of medical fraud (PCR tests) and further immune destruction (vaccines) if the pandemic industry hadn't already devised (or are working toward the development of) a newly, highly transmissible and deadly bird flu strain? Currently, the CDC reports that there are “no indicators of unusual influenza activity in people, including avian influenza A(H5).” This could all change, however, once there is mass participation with the newest EUA PCR tests, which will be designed to lump all Fall illnesses into the bird flu category “out of an abundance of caution.” Let the lockdowns commence. As October approaches, be advised that the U.S. government has already laid the groundwork for declaring a pandemic of bird flu, and they will be using new PCR tests to declare all the circulating illnesses in the population a “bird flu pandemic.” The vaccines are already prepared, and there will likely be a new campaign to get shots in arms. The pattern of abuse continues. Attorney Ray Flores spoke with the Defender about the federal government and public health authorities repeating a 2020 scenario. “Just as EUA PCR tests exaggerated the COVID-19 pandemic, the detection of avian influenza and influenza A viruses with pandemic potential via unlicensed PCR tests is destined to justify lockdowns, masking, invasive nasal swabs, and wide-scale vaccination with experimental mRNA technology.” He continued, “The stage is set for RT-PCR tests to take the pivotal role of determining false positives with amped up cycle thresholds designed to declare asymptomatic, otherwise healthy people to be infected — just like last time.” AMA prepares procedural terminology codes to include bird flu vaccines, PCR tests The American Medical Association (AMA) has already updated its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to include a new code for bird flu vaccines. The AMA are preparing for the FDA’s EUA approval of cell-based and mRNA bird flu vaccines this Fall/Winter, and they will already have the CPT codes updated so providers can report the vaccine and PCR test on upcoming medical records. The AMA even reported that the CPT code update will ""ensure electronic systems across the U.S. health care system are prepared in advance for the potential FDA authorization"" of new PCR tests and vaccines for bird flu. They have prepared new codes for both children and adults, meaning the government is prepared to vaccinate the entire population once the FDA gives the EUA, which was recently permitted by the HHS under their new emergency declaration. Back on May 30, 2024, the U.S. government made an agreement with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest vaccine producers in the world, to produce 4.8 million doses of a “pre-pandemic vaccine that is well-matched to the H5 of the currently circulating H5N1 strain.” CSL Seqirus is already in an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a federal authority that funnels taxpayer dollars into the development of vaccines. Seqirus, with its $1 billion facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina, has the capacity to produce 150 million flu vaccine within six months of an emergency pandemic declaration. BARDA has also funneled $176 million to Moderna to develop a testing and vaccine platform for H5N1. The deal is already done and the vaccine is set to launch in 2025. As millions of vaccines are produced in advance, it's an important time to get prepared for the societal upheaval that is certain to come.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-05-swiss-government-kidnaps-child-threatens-parents-transgender.html,Swiss government kidnaps child and threatens parents with jail time for opposing transgender mutilation,"A Swiss court has ruled that a couple who was forcibly separated from their teenage daughter in Switzerland because they objected to her undergoing transgender surgery must supply the documents she needs to facilitate a legal sex change. The parents, who responded to their daughter’s mental health struggles by proving her with mental healthcare and are being unfairly targeted by the government, are appealing the order and seeking the reinstatement of their parental rights and a reunion with their daughter. The girl, who is now 16, has been separated from her parents for more than a year via court order. She has been living in a government youth shelter, and their access to her is regulated by the government. Her father stated: “We are deeply saddened that this nightmare situation continues. Not only has the state separated us from our daughter because we objected to her ‘transition’, but we are now being threatened with criminal charges if we do not aid in her ‘legal transition’ by handing over legal documents.” In other words, the authorities kidnapped a child and are threatening to toss her parents in jail simply because they are looking out for her health by opposing transgender mutilation. A legal transition would pave the way for medical interventions that cannot be undone, such as mutilating surgery and the use of cross-sex hormones. The parents explained in a video, which has since gone viral and attracted more than a million views, how their daughter told them near the end of the pandemic that she thought she was a boy. Acknowledging that she had been “going through a difficult period in her life,” they agreed to discuss the matter with doctors. They said that a nurse at a Geneva hospital presented her with a “gender unicorn” that they used to determine that she should be treated as a boy by the hospital. They were informed that she needed to take puberty blockers; her parents opted to seek mental healthcare instead. However, her school also got in on the act, with teachers and administrators beginning to call her by a male name. “We were very clear with the school, that we did not believe it was up to the school to socially transition our daughter. We learned that the school psychologist was getting in and was feeding my daughter with materials, putting her in contact with Le Refuge."" The transgender advocacy organization Le Refuge not only cheered the girl along in her quest but also convinced her that a psychotherapist she had been seeing was “transphobic” and that she should end treatment. The Swiss Child Protection agency then brought a case against the girl’s parents in the Swiss court system with support from her school. Girl's parents are only trying to protect her Her parents said they “can’t believe we live in a society where your child can be taken away from you simply for trying to protect her. We want our daughter back home. We love her and we miss her.” The video attracted the attention of Tesla and X owner Elon Musk, who noted: “Same thing is happening in California.” It’s horrifying that the government is insisting it is acting in the girl’s best interests by separating her from her loving parents at a crucial time in her development, setting her up for a lifetime of treatment with drugs and mutilation that is completely irreversible and may render her infertile. A lawyer for the girl’s family, Dr. Felix Boellmann of the Alliance Defending Freedom, stated: “No society can claim to be free if parents can lose their daughter solely for affirming biological reality .” "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-05-slovakia-deputy-pm-boycott-paris-olympics-closing.html,Slovakian deputy prime minister to BOYCOTT Paris Olympics closing ceremony following controversy over offensive Last Supper depiction,"Slovakian Deputy Prime Minister Tomas Taraba has decided to boycott the closing ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday, Aug. 11, after the opening ceremony was lambasted worldwide for its tasteless depiction of Jesus Christ's Last Supper. During the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics on July 26, drag queens, trans people, a nude singer and a man in blue body paint intended to represent Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, portrayed the biblical scene of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous painting ""The Last Supper."" The lavish opening show was staged along the Seine River in the French capital. Olympic organizers initially claimed the performance was meant to promote inclusivity and challenge violence. But when it sparked outrage among Christians, the organizers issued a half-baked apology and claimed no disrespect was intended. (Related: 2024 Paris Olympics organizers issue formal apology to Christian groups over Last Supper mockery .) In line with this, Taraba, who was meant to attend the closing ceremony as the Slovakian government's representative, decided to boycott the event. Taraba accused the Olympic organizers of presenting ""a disgusting exhibition full of LGBTI ideology and insults to the symbols of Christianity ."" ""I was supposed to represent Slovakia at the closing ceremony, but for the normal world, this Olympics will forever remain a symbol of degenerate decadence, which abused the beauty of sport and turned it into progressive political theater. Therefore, I decided not to participate in the closing ceremony,"" Taraba posted on Facebook on July 28. Opening of the 2024 Paris Olympics dubbed ""the gayest opening ceremony ever"" Aside from ""The Last Supper"" mockery, the 2024 Paris Olympics launched its opening ceremony with an elaborate street dance scene . The opening dance number featured women performing on poles as rain fell on the ceremonies and a scantily-clad, bearded drag queen provocatively dancing on the runway. Others danced in the streets, including men affectionately embracing each other on one of the many bridges across the Seine River in Paris. One prerecorded dance segment was even more explicitly LGBTQ-themed. In this segment, three dancers in gender-ambiguous costumes ran through the streets of Paris and into a building. The scene culminated with the three dancers — two males and one female — sharing dramatic kisses and then entering a room together for further intimate acts. The segment concluded with one of the dancers looking back at the camera and slamming a door, signaling their intention to engage in more intimate contact. In line with the opening, the 2024 Paris Olympics earned the title ""the gayest opening ceremony ever"" after the LGBT community dominated the stage that day. ""This is the gayest opening ceremony ever. Didn’t they ban Grindr in the Olympic Village tho?"" one user posted on X. Marion Marechal, a member of the European Parliament for France, even denounced the performance. ""To all the Christians of the world who are watching the Paris 2024 ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation,"" she posted on X.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-05-trump-may-appoint-rfk-jr-vaccine-czar.html,President Trump may appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as VACCINE CZAR to combat the DIRTY VACCINE pandemic for 2025 and beyond,"Prior to Trump’s first term in the oval office, and of course, prior to the whole “Warp Speed” vaccine rush to combat Fauci Flu, president-Elect Donald Trump spoke about how he believed too many vaccines too early in life is problematic for children’s developmental health and could be leading to autism spectrum disorder. Of course, the Vaccine Industrial Complex did not like hearing this, and it may be the number one reason the establishment despises “Orange Man.” President Trump then asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in 2017, if he would be interested in investigating the safety of vaccines and serve as the chair of “Vaccine Safety and Scientific Integrity Commission.” Just recently, Trump reminded Kennedy he would like him to take on the vaccine issue again, should Trump win the presidency back If you wonder what was running through Trump’s mind the day after he was nearly assassinated, wonder no further than the danger of dirty vaccines. Chemical violence. Someone high up in the U.S. government, who is NOT a pharma shill, needs to investigate these mRNA gene-mutating , cancer-causing China Flu clot shots immediately, because the next wave of the pandemic is surely on the horizon, just coming under a “novel” name. “Something is wrong with that whole system,” Trump said about the vaccine industry during an interview recently with RFK Jr. (Bobby). Trump explained, “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a 10-pound or a 20-pound baby… do you ever see the size of it, its massive, then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times.” Trump is talking about neurological disorders and developmental disorders, like autism, Asperger’s and other social and learning disabilities. The whole CDC needs to be reformed. It would be part of Kennedy’s legacy, and so important for the whole nation. We need a national sweeping reform of all vaccines, from the childhood “recommended” CDC onslaught of jabs, to mercury-laced flu shots, and on down to the dregs of dirty vaccines, the mRNA stabs (that don’t even qualify as “vaccines”, so the corrupt CDC had to rewrite the definition to accommodate them). New Vaccine Czar could force long-term clinical trials and transparency of results for all Americans to analyze before considering any injections ever again Trump knows several families personally that have a child who was perfectly healthy until they got a “battery of vaccines” and then developed a whole “suite of deficits” in the THREE MONTHS following the vaccines. Follow the science on this. These “vaccines” the CDC nearly enforces at gunpoint are laced with chemical agents that incapacitate the 2-year-old’s central nervous system and shock the immune system so violently that often permanent (or at least chronic) damage is done to the child. This is called vaccine violence. It’s like an overdose on drugs and they’re injected into the child, in combinations, series, and multi-doses. It’s like instead of a sip of wine as a first taste of alcohol, a teen drinks a fifth of vodka, straight up. What do you think is going to happen? Get the multi-dose flu shot that’s loaded with mercury, then a Covid clot shot that causes heart spasms and vascular blockages, then sock them with an MMR jab that gives them the Measles at the same time as the mumps and rubella, damaging the CNS, impairing the brain and decimating the child’s most important and vital developmental stage. It's time to have a new system put in place for American health, that focuses on NOT putting chemicals, GMOs, gene-mutating “mechanisms” (mRNA) and the world’s most dangerous heavy metal toxins in the body. We need transparency from independent labs that can test all these vaccines under proper protocol, long-term results and very high ""safe and effective"" proof in the pudding. It’s time to have a Vaccine Czar , with a massive team of nutritionists, biologists, immunologists and holistic doctors all working together with taxpayer funds. Anything’s possible. No more DIRTY VACCINES for children or adults. Bookmark Vaccines.news to your favorite independent websites for updates on Long-Vax-Syndrome that's sweeping the nation and the world as you read this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-05-biological-male-boxers-cleared-as-women-olympics.html,Two biological male boxers CLEARED to compete in Olympics as “women”,"Neither was allowed to participate in the world championships for the female side of their sport last year, but two ""trans women"" boxers were just cleared to compete against real women at the 2024 Olympics in Paris after the International Olympics Committee (IOC) gave them the green light. Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan are making headlines for qualifying to compete in this year's Olympics despite last year being disqualified from competing in the Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi. A series of DNA tests showed that the two athletes have ""XY chromosomes,"" to quote Umar Kremlev, president of the International Boxing Association (IBA). Kremlev said in a statement that his group ""uncovered athletes who were trying to fool their colleagues and pretend to be women."" For daring to tell the truth and violate the ""transphobia"" creed, the IBA was stripped of being allowed to run Olympic boxing competitions. The IOC has instead decided that it does not matter one's DNA – if you are a male who wants to compete as a ""trans,"" then go for it . After last year's disqualification, the Algerian Olympic Committee accused the IBA of engaging in a ""conspiracy"" to stop Khelif from winning a gold medal. As for Khelif's high testosterone levels, the Algerian Olympic Committee blamed ""medical reasons."" (Related: Women's cycling no longer exists now that biological male ""trans women"" are allowed to compete.) Men fighting women isn't a fair fight Mexico's Brianda Tamara had the displeasure of fighting Khelif before the disqualification. Here is what she wrote on X about what it was like: ""When I fought with her [sic] I felt very out of my depth. Her [sic] blows hurt me a lot, I don't think I had ever felt like that in my 13 years as a boxer, nor in my sparring with men. Thank God that day I got out of the ring safely, and it's good that they finally realized."" There is a possibility that neither Khelif nor Yu-Ting are biological males after all, at least according to the feminist website Reduxx . It could be that Khelif and Yu-Ting are suffering from ""Difference of Sexual Development,"" or DSD, a medical profile where one's genitalia differs from one's chromosomes. Former American Olympian Nancy Hogshead, who won three gold medals for swimming at the 1984 Games, would seem to disagree. She tweeted that ""gender ideology will get women KILLED."" ""Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan are scheduled to compete in women's Olympic boxing – despite being disqualified last year for having XY chromosomes, the male phenotype,"" Hogshead further wrote. ""Let's remind ourselves that males – however they identify – pack a punch that is 162 per cent more powerful than women – THE biggest performance gap between men and women."" A spokesperson from the IOC responded to the controversy by claiming that everything is as it should be. ""All athletes participating in the boxing tournament comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations, in accordance with the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit,"" the spokesperson said. Though they would certainly risk their careers by doing so, real female athletes could simply refuse to participate in fighting or competing against biological males who claim to be ""trans women."" A few have already done just that. ""Apart from the Olympic governing body, everyone else can see that this isn't a level playing field,"" a commenter wrote. ""It's a dangerous decision.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-04-parents-serve-jail-time-for-opposing-transgender-mutilations.html,Swiss government “kidnaps” children and threatens parents with jail time for opposing transgender mutilations,"A Swiss court recently ruled that the parents of a minor ""stolen"" by the government should provide legal documents to allow the child a gender alteration intervention despite them disagreeing with the procedure. Three years ago, the kid was separated from her parents because they refused to give their daughter puberty blockers. The kid, now 16 years old, wanted to transition into a boy. Now that the parents lost the case, the highest court in the canton of Geneva, the Court of Justice, is now ordering them to hand over the needed documents so they can submit the teenager to the alteration procedure. The father, who had appealed the order, said: ""We are deeply saddened that this nightmare situation continues."" ""Not only has the state separated us from our daughter because we objected to her 'transition,' but we are now being threatened with criminal charges if we do not aid in her 'legal transition' by handing over legal documents,"" he added. He also pointed out that if this injustice can happen to them, it can also happen to other parents. ""We will not give up trying to protect our daughter and will seek to appeal this decision,"" he further vowed. In a viral video shared on X, formerly Twitter, the father recalled how it all started. ""About three years ago, our daughter informed us that she was a boy. We understood that she was going through a difficult period in her life so we agreed to seek medical advice,"" he said. Then, they went to the Geneva hospital where they were instructed that they should start treating the child as a boy because of an assessment that used a 'gender unicorn' diagnostic test performed by one of their nurses. ""We were told she needed puberty blockers,"" the father recalled and added that soon enough, the school also got involved. Then, the teachers, administrators and everyone at school started to call the teenager a male name. ""We were very clear with the school, that we did not believe it was up to the school to socially transition our daughter. We learned that the school psychologist was getting in and was feeding my daughter with materials, putting her in contact with Le Refuge,"" he further said. Le Refuge is a transgender advocacy organization, which has taken their daughter down the path of believing that she’s a boy in a girl's body. The organization also convinced the daughter that her psychotherapist was ""transphobic."" Eventually, the Swiss Child Protection Agency, with the school's support, brought a case against the parents in the Swiss court system. Not only had their daughter been taken by the government they also lost tens of thousands of dollars paying legal fees. And now, they are also threatened with serving jail time. Meanwhile, Big Tech mogul Elon Musk commented on the post sharing the father's interview with: ""Same thing is happening in California."" The said social media entry where Musk commented was shared by the handle Billboard Chris and now has 24.8 million views. Same thing is happening in California https://t.co/8KWF7f27xs — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 1, 2024 Musk's followers were also quick to react, with most of them saying that it is ""sickening that it's spread everywhere across America when it should have never been allowed."" Another one posted a meme with the copy: ""Liberalism is when you think injecting cattle with hormones is evil but injecting kids with hormones to change their gender is just fine."" California Senate bans schools from notifying parents about their kids' gender identity, sexual orientation After more than an hour of debate in which Democratic LGBTQ+ senators lamented about how they delayed coming out to their parents or were outed by someone else, the state Senate approved on August 1 the proposal that bans school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents if their child has found a new pronoun to use at school. The proposal also bars the schools from passing or enforcing policies requiring school staff to disclose the student's gender identity or sexual orientation to their parents without the child's permission. The lawmakers approved the legislation as they argued that gender non-conforming students should be able to come out to their families on their own terms. Meanwhile, Republicans say the state shouldn't dictate whether school districts can enforce so-called parental notification policies and that schools should be transparent with parents. Republican Sen. Kelly Seyarto, who represents Murrieta in Southern California, said schools should increase transparency with parents by notifying them of their child's gender identification change. ""If we include the parents, that's the best way to take something from people being angry and mad to developing a solution that works for everybody,"" he said. Greg Burt, vice president of the conservative Christian advocacy group California Family Council also weighed in saying, ""California officials shouldn't prevent all parents from being notified because of the possibility that some parents may react badly. You don't assume that all parents are unsafe. That shouldn't be the assumption."" The bill now heads to the state Assembly, where it would need to pass in committees and on the floor before it can reach the desk of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose administration is known for fighting school boards over their notification policies.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-04-iba-criticizes-olympics-male-boxers-compete.html,International Boxing Association criticizes Olympics for allowing male boxers to compete in women’s event,"The International Boxing Association (IBA) has called out the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for allowing a biological male boxer who failed the IBA's gender eligibility test to compete in the Paris games as a woman. The boxer in question, Imane Khelif of Algeria, was thrust into the spotlight following a boxing match this week against Italian boxer Angela Carini that lasted just 46 seconds. Within seconds of the beginning of the match, Carini was subjected to very powerful punches that prompted her to drop her helmet and call the match “unjust” before falling to the floor crying and refusing to shake hands with Khelif. Khelif is said to be a biological male and has been banned from participating in female matches in the past as a result. Carini reported that she had never been hit so hard in her boxing career and said the pain was too overwhelming for her to continue with the match. She said: “I’m used to suffering. I’ve never taken a punch like that; it’s impossible to continue. “I got into the ring to fight, but I didn’t feel like it anymore after the first minute. I started to feel a strong pain in my nose. I didn’t give up, but a punch hurt too much and so I said enough. I’m leaving with my head held high,” she added. Carini’s coach later said that many people in Italy warned her not to go to the match, saying “it’s a man; it’s dangerous for you.” The incident has drawn a significant amount of controversy, with many people expressing shock and dismay that a female boxer could be expected to fight against a biological male in the women's competition. IBA confirms Khelif is a biological male and asks why IOC let him compete against women Now, the International Boxing Association has weighed in with a statement addressing reports in the media about Khelif’s previous disqualification from major boxing matches, and the main takeaway is that Khelif is indeed not a woman by their eligibility definitions and that the IOC needs to explain why this biological male was allowed to compete in the women’s sport. Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting are not transgender, but they were unable to pass tests confirming they are female. As a result, they were disqualified from the IBA women's World Boxing championships in New Delhi last year. The statement, which can be read in full online, explains: “This disqualification was a result of their failure to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women’s competition, as set and laid out in the IBA Regulations. This decision, made after a meticulous review, was extremely important and necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition.” The IBA clarified that the test involved was not of testosterone. Instead, they say it was a “recognized test” whose specifics are confidential. They noted: “This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.” They added that both individuals failed two tests carried out by the IBA on different occasions: the one at New Delhi in 2023 as well as one at Istanbul in 2022. While Lin Yu-ting did not appeal the IBA's decision, Khelif appealed it at first but later withdrew her appeal during the process. In both cases, the decision is therefore legally binding. Although the IBA is confident that it has ensured the competitive fairness of its events, it voiced concerns in the statement that rational eligibility criteria are not being applied consistently by other sports organizations, and this includes the International Olympics Committee. They believe that their willingness to allow a biological male to compete renders the games unfair and would like to see the IOC answer for their actions. “The IOC’s differing regulations on these matters, in which IBA is not involved, raise serious questions about both competitive fairness and athletes’ safety. For clarification on why the IOC permits athletes with competitive advantages to compete in their events, we urge interested parties to seek answers directly from the IOC.” The idea that watching men beat women up in a boxing ring has become an Olympic sport is horrific but sadly, it's not that surprising in light of their anti-Christian opening ceremony.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-truth-kamala-harris-california-homelessness-crime-abortion.html,TRUTH about Kamala Harris: She worsened California homelessness and crime while prosecuting pro-life filmmakers,"While employed as attorney general of California, Kamala Harris helped destroy the state by being soft on crime. She was too busy, it turns out, prosecuting pro-life journalists for daring to expose Planned Parenthood and its black-market baby body parts racket. Upon learning that Planned Parenthood was illegally selling and profiting from the sale of aborted baby body parts, David Daleiden and his team went undercover to catch the abortion provider in the act as part of a series of videos that started being released by the Center for Medical Progress in 2015. After Kamala went after him and his team, Daleiden sued both Planned Parenthood and Kamala for violating his civil rights. The Federalist reported that it was Kamala and then-California attorney general Xavier Becerra who spearheaded the witch hunt against Daleiden and his team under the ""guise of state recording laws."" ""When the Center for Medical Progress began releasing its undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives discussing fetal tissue trafficking in 2015, Harris launched an investigation on Daleiden, ordered a raid on his home, and seized his camera equipment and hard drives,"" reported Madeline Osburn on May 13, 2020. ""Daleiden's undercover videos did not violate California video recording law, which does not prohibit anybody from recording conversations in a public area that anybody can oversee, but that did not stop Planned Parenthood and Harris from wielding a political prosecution against Daleiden."" (Related: As of July 21, 2024, Joe Biden is no longer acting president of the United States – the U.S. Treasury under Janet Yellen controls the country.) Kamala: one of the abortion industry's biggest promoters In early 2019, EWTN posted a segment to YouTube in which Daleiden sat down and explained the close connections Kamala has to Planned Parenthood – watch below : The Washington Examiner also published a piece about how Kamala is ""an abortion extremist"" who has never had to answer for her extreme pro-death position. Kamala supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, as does Biden. So-called late-term abortion is another favorite of Kamala who believes it is a woman's choice to murder her baby even as it is about to exit the womb during birth. ""I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body,"" Kamala said at the only vice-presidential debate she participated in back in 2020. ""It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence ...,"" she continued before trailing off and changing the topic with no further probing from the debate moderators. Kamala has made it clear that she views pro-life laws in the same way as Jim Crow laws. States that pass their own laws criminalizing abortion are to be treated as criminal states, she believes. Kamala also considers the pro-life position in general to be outside the bounds of allowable opinion in the United States. ""On this issue, I'm a former prosecutor,"" Kamala made abundantly clear about how she looks at pro-life journalists like Daleiden who seek to expose the abortion industry's crimes against unborn humanity. If elected as president this fall, you can be sure Kamala will strip all conscience protections for doctors and nurses who oppose abortion and refuse to take part in performing them. This is one of the provisions in the so-called ""Woman's Reproductive Protection Act,"" which she co-sponsored. ""She comes from San Francisco, of all places,"" commented former Rep. Kevin McCarthy in a recent Fox News interview about Kamala's past – San Francisco is collapsing, by the way, due to her far-left policies. Kamala is a joke – but then again, they all are .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-top-8-reasons-surge-cross-dressing-trannies.html,Top 8 reasons for the SURGE in cross-dressing “trannies” and all this “pansexuality” spreading across America,"What are “gay chemicals?” Can chemicals and drugs in food and medicine turn a boy into a girl, or just make a boy want to be a girl? What if these drugs and hormone disrupters make males want to have intercourse with other males? Just how much of these is the average American human child “consuming” regularly? Also, if the males just have sex with other males, then that’s a depopulation mechanism, right? This requires careful consideration. With communism (rule by Obamala Harris and Dementia ""child-hair-sniffing"" Joe), comes complete tyrannical government dictatorship and control of the populace. This means reducing how many citizens maintain independence by owning valuable assets, like land, homes, guns, farms that produce “clean” food, small businesses, etc. It also means Big Pharma controlling all medicine, vaccines and of course, pesticide manufacturing, use and “FDA approvals.” Lastly, it means total mind control by Big Tech, Social Media, YouTube, Google and more. Keep the kids and teens from thinking about anything that really matters. That's the ultimate agenda of the perverted, demented Democrat-run, CCP-style government. Also, with communism being installed in America , comes the destruction of the nuclear family. This means pushing kids and teens to think that pansexuality, promiscuity, “gender fluidity” and having multiple sex partners is normal and should not be “discriminated against.” With this comes the “pansexual” (they'll have sex with anything) predators and their naïve (or enslaved) participants. With this comes mass-illegal-immigration of criminals, orphans and lost children who get trafficked and prostituted for the “cause.” Top 8 reasons for the surge in communist-style “gayness” that’s spreading across America #1. Female hormones and endocrine disrupters in meat (including pigs, cows, turkeys, chickens and “farm-raised” fish, plus dairy, including conventional milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, sour cream, butter, and the list just goes on) #2. Democrats/Liberals push to pervert children and teens during development stages, including Drag Queen Story Hour (organized by pedos) that tours thousands of daycare centers, talk shows, local libraries, like a touring queer strip club (hands-on) presentation for kids #3. Demented pornography on internet now easily accessed #4. Social media has coerced and deformed youth thinking, convincing them they are all confused about gender, and can switch back and forth anytime, from male to female, or be both, or be an “furry” animal (that defecates in provided litter boxes in school bathrooms) #5. Grooming starting at the daycare level now and is literally woven into the public school’s curriculum starting with kindergarten and progressing through elementary, middle grades, high school and college, often without parents knowing #6. Communist government and media trying to normalize “gender fluid” confusion and wreck the nuclear family #7. The now Communist establishment, Big Pharma, including MDs, surgeons and psychiatrists, are raking in the bucks doling out hormone drugs, performing genitalia-mutilation surgeries and then diagnosing and “treating” all the depression that comes with all of that #8. Pesticides, in most conventional crops, produce, grains, vegetables and fruits – this includes atrazine, one of the world’s most-used pesticides , that contains gender-altering (endocrine disrupting) toxins that turn animals gay (emasculates males frogs and can even turn them into females) One of the world’s most widely used pesticides, called atrazine, interferes with the reproduction of animals and can turn male frogs into females The herbicide (weed killer) atrazine is shown in scientific studies to emasculate three-fourths of adult male frogs, turning a tenth of them into females, while wreaking havoc with the sex lives of most of the rest. Pesticide apologists admit atrazine is used by nearly half a million U.S. farmers for weed control for their corn, wheat, sorghum and sugar cane. Follow the gender fluid bouncing ball. Yes folks, chemical castration is real. Atrazine herbicide is scientifically proven to chemically castrate male animals, meaning these animals lose the ability to reproduce in the wild, according to an in-depth study by University of California, Berkeley, biologists. Male frogs are literally missing testosterone and sperm. Others have fertility rates as low as 10 percent, and only when paired and isolated with females. If you think frogs are the only animals affected in this way, think again. Over 80 MILLION POUNDS of atrazine are dumped on U.S. corn (and other staple crops) each year, and you can bet your whole pharma investment portfolio that it also contaminates nearby ground and surface water. Atrazine interferes with endocrine hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, in amphibians, fish, birds, reptiles, and humans (lab rats) across the country. Add in more hormone-disrupting chemicals into the food, water and personal care products, including bisphenol-A, triclosan, DDT, lead and perfluorochemicals (PFAs), and you’ve got a whole country of gender-confused, social-media influenced, Big Government blinded millennials (and now their kids) with screwed up hormones. They’re just trying to “figure out” their own sexual identity, and they can’t stop thinking about gay sex partners 24/7/365. Now science is revealing that the Covid clot shots could be interfering with hormonal balance and causing anxiety and depression. If so, that’s going to exacerbate the grooming “revolution” the communists are pushing so hard for. Tune your internet dial to Gender.news for updates on extreme liberals and the Communists in Washington DC, all with hidden agendas trying to turn normal kids into easily controlled, pharma-dependent, gender-confused freaks.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-uk-high-court-upholds-puberty-blockers-ban.html,U.K. High Court upholds emergency legislation puberty blockers ban,"The United Kingdom's High Court of Justice in London has ruled that it is lawful for the British government to ban puberty blockers through emergency legislation . In May, former Health Secretary Victoria Atkins restricted the use of puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria through the use of emergency powers. Since then, puberty blockers – drugs that delay or prevent puberty – have only been available to minors with gender dysphoria who were already taking the drugs before the ban took effect. Other than that, puberty blockers can only be used in National Health Services (NHS) clinical trials and other emergencies. This decision was in response to the NHS's Cass Review published in May, the world's largest review detailing the dangers of medical transgender interventions on children. Hilary Cass, a pediatrician commissioned by the NHS to review available transgender services for dysphoric minors, found that ""gender medicine"" is ""built on shaky foundations"" and that while these drastic interventions should be done with extreme vigilance, ""quite the reverse happened in the field of gender care for children."" (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing… chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting welcomes decision Justice of the High Court Beverly Lang ruled on July 29 that the ban on puberty blockers is lawful. U.K.'s new Health Secretary Wes Streeting welcomed the decision of the High Court. ""I welcome the court's decision today. Children's healthcare must be evidence-led. Dr Cass' review found there was insufficient evidence that puberty blockers are safe and effective for children with gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. We must therefore act cautiously and with care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people. ""I am working with NHS England to improve children's gender identity services, and to setting up a clinical trial to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. I want trans people in our country to feel safe, accepted and able to live with freedom and dignity,"" Streeting stated. However, trans campaign group TransActual U.K. and a gender dysphoric minor legally challenged the decision . The plaintiffs argued that Atkins failed to consult patient groups and misused the emergency process. Chay Brown, the director for healthcare at TransActual, said the ruling was disappointing. ""Defense evidence makes clear that they decided on an emergency ban first and sought ways to justify it second,"" Brown remarked. ""We are seriously concerned about the safety and welfare of young trans people in the United Kingdom."" The Good Law Project, an organization working with TransActual, echoed Brown's statement. The group stated that future consultations on the healthcare of minors ""must be taken seriously and include input from real experts and those most directly affected by the changes.""

She cried injustice from being pitted against a ""biologically male"" Algerian boxer named Imane Khelif. ""This is unjust,"" she yelled. Carini, a 25-year-old police officer, yanked her hand away from the referee and walked off as the official raised Khelif's hand in the air. She also refused to shake hands with her opponent and fell to her knees on the boxing ring's floor, saying she had never felt such strong blows in a contest before. Her competitor Khelif has already been banned by the International Boxing Association from the 2023 world championships after failing testosterone tests to establish gender qualification. ""I've never taken a punch like that, it's impossible to continue. I'm nobody to say it's illegal. I got into the ring to fight. But I didn't feel like it anymore after the first minute. I started to feel a strong pain in my nose. I didn't give up, but a punch hurt too much so I said enough. I'm leaving with my head held high,"" Carini said. ""I am a fighter. My father taught me to be a warrior. When I am in the ring, I use that mindset, the mindset of a warrior, a winning mindset. This time I couldn't make it."" She was later taken away for medical assessment to examine the seriousness of her facial injuries which included a bruised nose. The female boxer said she did not quit the fight as a sign of protest against her rival's inclusion, but that was a decision for the Olympics to consider. ""I am not in the position of saying this is right or wrong. I did my job as a boxer, entering the ring and fighting. I didn't manage to, but I am exiting with my head held high and with a broken heart,"" she said. ""I am a mature woman, the ring is my life. I've always been very instinctive, but when I feel something is not going well, it's not a surrender but having the maturity to stop."" Meanwhile, Khelif said: ""God is willing me to be golden one."" The Algerian Boxing Federation also boasted about the win on Facebook. ""Congratulations to the Algerian boxer Iman Khalif, who responds strongly in the ring and qualifies for the quarterfinals, after defeating the Italian Angelina Carini in less than 46 seconds, effortlessly,"" it said. Controversial boxing match meets backlash from popular personalities, internet community Following the scandalous sporting event, where a ""mismatch"" has been alleged, popular personalities sent in their sentiments via the internet. Riley Gaines, a 12-time All-American and former collegiate swimmer at Kentucky who describes herself as a ""leader defending women's single-sex spaces,"" posted on X that "" Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini."" X CEO Elon Musk immediately concurred with a resounding ""Absolutely!"" to her initial social media entry. In another entry, the swimmer also shared a photo of an emotional Carini on her knees in the ring, calling the moment ""heartbreaking."" ""This photo should haunt the [International Olympic Committee] IOC (but it won't),"" Gaines captioned the post. (Related: Former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines slams SFSU official for lauding violent transgender protesters .) Famous YouTuber-turned-boxer Logan Paul called the Olympic clash ""the purest form of evil unfolding right before your eyes."" ""A man was allowed to beat up a woman on a global stage, crushing her life's dream while fighting for her deceased father. This delusion must end,"" he tweeted. The internet community also blamed the IOC. Former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss also reacted, saying: ""When will this madness stop? Men cannot become women . Why is the British Government not objecting to this?"" British Olympic hero Sharron Davies chimed in with: ""This is shocking. The IOC is a bloody disgrace. In effect legalizing beating up females. This must stop!!! What the hell's the matter with them?"" Harry Potter author JK Rowling called the match insane and inquired: ""What will it take to end this insanity?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-nbc-fcc-complaint-obscene-olympics-opening-ceremony.html,NBC faces FCC complaint for airing OBSCENE Paris Olympics opening ceremony,"Mainstream media outlet NBC is facing an obscenity complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after it aired the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, which faced severe backlash over its depiction of drag queens, transgender individuals and other inappropriate content. The conservative watchdog Judicial Watch filed the complaint with the FCC on Monday, July 29, charging NBC of airing ""obscene and indecent"" content that was viewed by millions of people, including children. ""The blasphemous Olympics' Opening Ceremony , which included, among other obscene and indecent acts, a man partially exposing himself around children, is patently offensive for any sensible American and requires immediate FCC action against NBC ,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. ""The Justice Department should also launch an investigation, especially given the use of children in this obscene and indecent NBC broadcast."" The obscene content in question is a depiction of Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper, but with Jesus Christ and His Apostles replaced with drag queens, transgender individuals and a naked man. Other segments of the ceremony were accused of having Satanic or apocalyptic connotations, including a depiction of the pale horse of death as described in the Book of Revelations and depictions of the beheaded Queen Marie Antoinette. As stated by the FCC, "" federal law prohibits obscene, indecent and profane content from being broadcast on the radio or TV."" The federal agency additionally defines ""obscene"" content as that which ""appeals to an average person’s prurient interest; depicts or describes sexual conduct in a 'patently offensive' way; and, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value."" It added that ""indecent content portrays sexual or excretory organs or activities in a way that is patently offensive but does not meet the three-prong test for obscenity. Profane content includes 'grossly offensive' language that is considered a public nuisance ."" Several Christian institutions, along with the French Catholic Church, also came forward with concerns about the skit, contending it ""included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity."" According to Father Raymond J. de Souza, writing in the Irondale based National Catholic Register , Satan came back to France and his instruments this time were not bloodthirsty jihadists, but the artistic directors of the Paris Olympics opening ceremonies, who conceived of the sacrilegious drag-queen travesty of the Last Supper . ""The deep significance of the sacrilege is that Satan knows what the Last Supper accomplished. There, Jesus instituted the means by which he would remain in the world. Knowing that, Satan rebels… he rebels with mockery before a global audience,"" De Souza said. Paris Olympics organizers apologize to Christian groups for opening ceremony The anger forced a reply from the Paris Olympics organizers, with spokesperson Anne Descamps releasing an apology to Christian believers who felt disrespected. (Related: Paris Olympics officials issue half-hearted apology after worldwide outrage over woke Last Supper parody ) ""There was clearly never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. On the contrary, I think we tried to celebrate community. We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we're of course really sorry,"" Descamps said during a news conference on Sunday, July 28. The ceremony's artistic director, Thomas Jolly, made it clear that the event's message was deliberate. ""We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-olympic-christ-threatens-to-sue-critics.html,Olympic “Christ” threatens to sue critics over “Last Supper” backlash,"Barbara Butch, the LGBTQ activist who was the center figure in the controversial “Last Supper” Paris Olympic scene is threatening to sue those criticizing her. Butch played the role ( wearing a Christ-like halo ) viewed by many as a spoof on Christ in the Last Supper. The creators insist that they were going for a type of “pagan party” of Olympic gods and sent a message of tolerance. Art experts have supported the creators and pointed to paintings that inspired the pagan motif. That is not exactly what was seen by millions of Christians who were deeply insulted by the parody. (Article republished from JonathanTurley.org ) The question is not the intent of the creators, but the intent of critics in denouncing the display and its participants. The threat of legal action would not be especially serious in the United States where opinion is given robust protection in both criminal and civil cases. In France, however, free speech is in a free fall with the left pushing for the censorship and criminalization of an ever-expanding range of political and religious speech. The ceremony itself had some truly powerful and stunning elements. I enjoyed the mix of music and imagery as well as the effort to show the diversity of France. However, other elements were more divisive or excessive. For example, the producers decided to use the ceremony to feature such elements as three young people hooking up for a “ ménage à trois .” With many families watching with kids, many of us thought the scene was inappropriate for such an event. However, it was the supper scene that led to protests from clerics and critics. While claiming a message of “tolerance,” the scene was taken as yet another slap at religious elements in society. That is a debate that has continued to rage, particularly on the Internet. Audrey Msellati, Butch’s attorney, posted a statement on Butch’s Instagram account that the DJ and activist will seek legal action after being “the target of an extremely violent campaign of cyber-harassment and defamation.” She is promising to file “several complaints against these acts.” Clearly, any direct and intentional threats of violence against Butch should be prosecuted, as they can be prosecuted in the United States. However, the French laws sweep far more broadly in criminalizing opinion and what I have called “rage rhetoric.” In France, such complaints are often criminal matters. In my new book, “ The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage, ” I discuss the collapse of free speech rights in France as well as other European countries. This anti-free speech wave has now reached our shores. It has many allies in our own anti-free speech movement. American leaders such as Hillary Clinton have actually enlisted the help of European censors to seek to silence American citizens. Once the cradle of individual liberty, France long ago became a global leader in the crackdown on free speech. These laws criminalize speech under vague standards referring to “inciting” or “intimidating” others based on race or religion. For example, fashion designer John Galliano has been found guilty in a French court on charges of making anti-Semitic comments against at least three people in a Paris bar. At his sentencing, Judge Anne Marie Sauteraud read out a list of the bad words used by Galliano to Geraldine Bloch and Philippe Virgitti, including using ‘dirty whore” in criticism. In another case, the father of French conservative presidential candidate Marine Le Pen was fined because he had called people from the Roma minority “smelly.” A French teenager was charged for criticizing Islam as a “religion of hate.” I also wrote earlier about the prosecution of famous actress Brigitte Bardot for saying in 2006 that Muslims were ruining France in a letter to then-Interior Minister (and later President) Nicolas Sarkozy. Bardot, an animal rights activist, was repeatedly hit with such criminal complaints for criticizing different groups. While wildly popular with many in Congress , French President Emmanuel Macron has consistently worked against free speech rights . That is why the homage in the Olympics to Liberté rang hollow for many of us in the free speech community. The French leaders have long been hypocritical in claiming to support free speech, such as marching in support of the Charles Hebdo magazine after the massacre after cracking down on its editors and writers. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director for the opening ceremony of the Olympics, clearly wanted to be provocative in these scenes. He succeeded. Clearly, such provocative elements will spur debate and discussion, including heated opinions. Use of criminal sanctions for those expressing opinion would make a mockery of the display of fealty to French liberties that Jolly features in his ceremony. Read more at: JonathanTurley.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-uk-high-court-upholds-ban-puberty-blockers.html,U.K. High Court of Justice upholds Downing Street’s ban on PUBERTY BLOCKERS,"A high court in the United Kingdom has upheld an earlier ban on puberty blockers put in place by the British government. Justice Beverley Lang of the High Court of Justice in London affirmed the prohibition in a July 29 decision . She cited the Cass Review commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS) to back up her ruling. According to the said study, the evidence supporting so-called ""gender-affirming care"" is weak and that there are unknown risks that come with puberty blockers. TransActual UK, an LGBT activist group, and an unnamed youth challenged the ban by former British Health Secretary Victoria Atkins on prescribing these puberty blockers. Lang upheld the prohibition, preventing the NHS from prescribing these medications outside of clinical trials and also limits their availability from private providers. (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing... chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) The NHS had already ceased prescribing puberty blockers the previous year – citing insufficient evidence regarding their benefits and potential harms. TransActual Healthcare Director Chay Brown expressed concern that the government imposed the ban and subsequently sought justification for it. Brown highlighted the distress of young transgender individuals in the U.K. who feel neglected by the medical community and believe their existence has been politicized. While the ban was initiated by the recently ousted Conservative government, it might become a permanent measure under the new Labor administration. Incumbent British Health Secretary Wes Streeting endorsed the court's decision – emphasizing a cautious approach. Puberty blockers used in America to treat gender dysphoria despite lack of FDA approval Investigative journalist and author Gerry Posner pointed out that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved puberty blockers for treating gender dysphoria . He argues that these drugs can have serious and lasting effects. The U.S. regulator has approved these medications for other uses such as certain infertility issues, treating endometriosis, prostate cancer and a rare genetic condition in children. However, since puberty blockers are not FDA-approved for treating gender dysphoria, doctors prescribe these drugs to minors ""off-label"" for a purpose not officially approved by the FDA. In some U.S. states, teens as young as 15 can receive puberty blockers without parental consent. Supporters of puberty blockers argue that they are largely safe and reversible. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) claims these treatments can be stopped without lasting effects. However, a report from Britain's NHS suggests that these drugs may trap children in a treatment path as 96 to 98 percent of those who start puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones. Despite claims that puberty blockers have been safely used since the late 1980s, significant evidence points to serious long-term side effects. In 2017, the Center for Investigative Reporting disclosed that the FDA had received over 10,000 adverse event reports from women who took ""Lupron"" off-label as children to increase their height. The side effects included bone density loss, cognitive issues, dental issues, fertility problems, fibromyalgia, joint pains, migraines, mood swings, seizures, spinal problems and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the FDA added another warning about the risk of brain swelling and vision loss in children on these medications. The lack of conclusive research demonstrating that the benefits of puberty blockers outweigh the risks has led to increased scrutiny in the U.S. and internationally. Several U.S. states with Republican-majority legislatures have restricted or banned gender-affirming care for minors. Finland, Norway and Sweden have also scaled back the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors, citing concerns over side effects. In the U.K., the NHS closed its largest youth gender clinic after numerous clinicians resigned, alleging pressure to over-diagnose vulnerable youth and prescribe inappropriate treatments. Nevertheless, the prevailing medical practice in the U.S. and much of Europe continues to favor ""gender-affirming"" treatments over alternative approaches, like watchful waiting and therapy.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-meta-running-ads-illegal-drugs-facebook-instagram.html,"Meta running ads for cocaine, opioids and other ILLEGAL DRUGS while censoring the truth about natural medicine","Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms is running advertisements on Facebook and Instagram that guide users to online marketplaces for illegal drugs . According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the revelation comes amid the tech giant facing a federal probe over the matter in March. Despite this, the Menlo Park, California-based Meta has continued to obtain income from ads that violate its policies, which prohibit promoting the sale of illicit or recreational drugs. A review by the WSJ discovered dozens of ads selling illegal substances like cocaine and prescription opioids – with the ads displaying photos of prescription drug bottles, lots of pills or bricks of cocaine. ""Place your orders,"" said one of the ads the discovered in July, which also contained a photo of a razor blade, and a yellow powder arranged to spell out ""DMT,"" a psychedelic drug. (Related: AI-generated ads and addicting psychiatric medications make for a ""deadly cocktail."" ) The WSJ 's findings dovetailed with those from an investigation of the nonprofit Tech Transparency Project (TTP). The nonprofit found that Meta's ad library from March to June had more than 450 illicit drug ads on Facebook and Instagram. Some of the accounts behind the ads use names that make it clear they purvey illicit drugs, with the ad for DMT being posted by an account named ""DMT Vapes and Notes."" Users who click the links in the ads are usually moved to private group chats on the Telegram app, which isn't under Meta. But according to TTP, there are some instances that the ads connect to private group chats on WhatsApp, Meta's encrypted messaging service. These group chats generally display a series of posts from the dealers that contain photos of the drugs they provide, menus with costs and instructions for placing orders. A number of the private chats contain posts that state ""TD"" or ""touchdown"" to suggest a successful shipment to a customer delivered by way of a shipping service. Meta: Ads for illegal drugs taken down, accounts behind them banned ""You don't need the dark web anymore when you can just buy a Facebook ad to sell dangerous drugs or even scam people at a scale that wouldn't have been possible through the dark web,"" said TTP Director Katie Paul. While Meta utilizes artificial intelligence tools to moderate content on its platforms, these weren't enough to stem the tide of drug-related ads. The use of photos to display the contraband goods seemingly allowed the ads to bypass content moderation systems. A Meta spokesman said the company disabled several of the drug ads spotted by the WSJ within 48 hours after they were published. All of the ads have now been removed for violating platform policies, and the users behind those ads were also banned. ""Our systems are designed to proactively detect and enforce against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating our drug policies,"" the Meta spokesman said. ""We continue to invest resources and further improve our enforcement on this kind of content. Our hearts go out to those suffering from the tragic consequences of this epidemic – it requires all of us to work together to stop it."" According to the spokesman, Meta is working with law enforcement against this illicit activity. He added that the company is employing insights about recent antagonistic tactics gathered from examining these ads to expand and carry out added sweeps.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-republican-attorney-general-sues-hhs.html,Republican Attorney General sues Department of Health and Human Services,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the Biden administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (Article republished from WLTReport.com ) “Paxton has sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Secretary Xavier Becerra, and other members of the Biden Administration for adopting a rule that purports to nullify parents’ state-law rights to consent to their children’s medical care,” Paxton’s office stated in a press release. Attorney General Ken Paxton Sues Biden Administration Over Rule Forcing Health Entities to Provide Contraceptives To Minors Without Parental Consent, in Violation of State Law: https://t.co/mrB1sJsO6f — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) July 25, 2024 From Ken Paxton’s office : For more than 50 years, the Title X statute of the federal Public Health Service Act has provided grants to increase the availability of “comprehensive voluntary family planning services.” While HHS distributes these federally funded grants, organizations receiving funds must still comply with relevant state laws. Previously, a federal district court and a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Title X projects must comply with Texas’s parental-consent laws when dispensing prescription contraceptives to minors. Yet the Biden Administration’s agency rule defies this binding legal precedent by forbidding Title X projects from obtaining parental consent before providing contraceptives to minors, even though Texas law and the precedent of the Fifth Circuit require it. The lawsuit brought by Attorney General Paxton demands that the courts vacate this patently unlawful agency rule and issue a permanent injunction against its continued enforcement. “By attempting to force Texas healthcare providers to offer contraceptives to children without parental consent, the Biden Administration continues to prove they will do anything to implement their extremist agenda—even undermine the Constitution and violate the law,” Paxton said. “Federal courts have already shut down their previous attack on parental rights, and I will ensure that we stop them once again,” he added. KTSA News reports: Attorney General Paxton says the Biden Administration’s agency rule defies binding legal precedent by forbidding Title X projects from obtaining parental consent before providing contraceptives to minors, even though Texas law and the precedent of the Fifth Circuit require it.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-politicians-decry-mockery-last-supper-paris-olympics.html,Politicians worldwide decry MOCKERY of Last Supper at Paris Olympics opening ceremony,"Several politicians from all across the globe have united in their condemnation of the mockery of the Last Supper , which happened during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics. The mockery involved drag queens and artists replicating the Lord's Passion based on the painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. The drag queens took the role of the Apostles in the tableau, while a fat lesbian later identified as DJ and activist Barbara Butch took the role of Jesus Christ. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) took to X, writing that ""the mockery of the Last Supper was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world. The war on our faith and traditional values knows no bounds today."" Johnson expressed optimism despite this, adding in the same post: ""But we know that truth and virtue will always prevail."" He referred to a verse in the Gospel of Saint John , which reads: ""The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."" (John 1:5) U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) also took to X to voice her opposition to the Paris Olympics opening ceremony and the people running it. She also accused the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF) of censoring footage of the blasphemous display. ""The [CNOSF] has been hard at work taking down videos of their satanic, trans and occult opening ceremonies claiming copyright laws,"" Greene posted. ""It's our First Amendment right to share these videos and our [outrage] over the anti-Christian Olympic opening ceremonies."" (Related: Meta to ban ""HATE SPEECH"" during 3 major sporting events. ) Even Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini could not help but put in his two cents. He posted a picture of the actual painting and the tableau featuring the drag queens on X for comparison. ""Opening the Olympics by insulting billions of Christians around the world was a really bad start, dear French,"" Salvini wrote. ""Seedy."" Organizers of opening ceremony issue half-baked apology Even former U.S. President Donald Trump refused to hold back his criticism, openly expressing his disdain toward the opening ceremony during an appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Fox News . ""I thought that the opening ceremony was a disgrace, actually. I thought it was a disgrace,"" Trump told program host Laura Ingraham. ""I mean, they can do certain things. I thought it was terrible."" Trump nevertheless promised that the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics ""won't be insulting Christians."" He continued: ""We won’t be having a Last Supper portrayed the way they portrayed it."" The pushback against the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony was kick-started by Marion Marechal , a member of the European Parliament. She wrote: ""To all the Christians of the world who are watching the [Paris Olympics] opening ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking – but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation."" The organizers of the opening ceremony ultimately issued an apology for the outrage caused by the blasphemous display – albeit it was a half-baked one. ""Clearly, there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. On the contrary, I think … we really did try to celebrate community tolerance,"" said Anne Deschamps, spokeswoman for the Paris Olympics. ""Looking at the results of the polls that we shared, we believe that this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense – we are, of course, really, really sorry."" Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony, distanced his tableau from any parallels to the Lord's Passion. According to him, it was meant to celebrate diversity and pay tribute to feasting and French gastronomy. ""My wish isn't to be subversive, nor to mock or to shock,"" said Jolly. ""Most of all, I wanted to send a message of love, a message of inclusion and not at all to divide."" Head over to OutrageDepot.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-hotez-calls-for-police-military-anti-vaxxers.html,Vaccine shill Dr. Peter Hotez calls for the use of police and military forces against ANTI-VAXXERS,"Vaccine shill Dr. Peter Hotez has called for the use of police and military forces against what he calls ""anti-vaxxers."" The bow tie-wearing Hotez issued this call during a July 5 interview at the International Symposium of Pediatric Updates, held in Cartagena City, Colombia. He suggested that major organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should target ""anti-vaccine aggression."" Despite being deleted on YouTube, the Defender obtained a copy of that interview. ""What I've said to the Biden administration is, the health sector can't solve this on its own. We're going to have to bring in [DHS], the Commerce Department [and the] Justice Department to help us understand how to do this. I've said the same to [WHO Director-General] Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus]. We need the other United Nations agencies, [even] NATO,"" said Hotez. ""This is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two hundred thousands Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression [and] anti-science aggression – and so, this is now a lethal force. The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression."" In the same interview, Hotez linked ""anti-vaxxers"" to entities such as the Russian government. He also called for more stringent action against these ""anti-vaxxers,"" and also urged medical schools to educate new doctors about anti-vaccine sentiment. Hotez is currently the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine . He also holds patents for several vaccines and has helped developed some of these. Thus, it follows that Hotez is actively fighting ""anti-vaxxers"" as his income is on the line. In March, The Hill reported that Hotez has found a ""'parallel career fighting misinformation."" According to the outlet, Hotez finds this endeavor ""meaningful"" and argues that ""pushing back on the anti-vaccine movement is just as important as developing vaccines."" Several commentators weigh in on Hotez's remarks Several commentators weighed in on the remarks by Hotez during the July 5 interview. ""Peter has cashed in significantly on the [Wuhan coronavirus] COVID-19 pandemic and gets a lot of money when shots go into children's arms,"" said Children's Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker. Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough remarked: ""'Anti-science' and 'anti-vaxxer' are propaganda terms Hotez uses to establish a power dynamic over anyone who disagrees with him. Now Hotez is calling for a security state to enforce his propaganda instead of engaging in much needed dialogue over vaccine safety."" (Related: NATURE journal publishes article by Peter Hotez calling for medical police state tyranny against vaccine skeptics. ) ""Hotez presumes COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective as any vaccinologist would dream; sadly, his fantasy was over before it started. The COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe and failed to reduce hospitalization and death in prospective randomized trials or in valid observational studies. They never stopped transmission."" Microbiologist Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi questioned Hotez's scientific credentials, remarking that the vaccine shill ""is not a real scientist"" as ""his publications transmit his personal opinions and beliefs."" ""[Hotez] has never published any research article based on true scientific research. He has not conducted a single valid vaccine trial, and has zero data to back his claims. [Hotez] has been on the globalist team together with [Dr. Anthony] Fauci [and others], and is now turning to violence to silence all dissenters – this very fact disqualifies him as a physician,"" continued Bhakdi. International law professor Francis Boyle also pointed out that Hotez's suggestions are a call to violate established international human rights law. He also denounced the vaccine shill's ""Nazi mentality."" ""Coercing vaccines upon human beings without their informed and voluntary consent violates the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation, which is a crime against humanity,"" said Boyle, who teaches at the University of Illinois . ""What we see at work here with Hotez is the Nazi mentality that pervades so many vaccinologists like him. Hotez is revealing his true colors."" Head over to VaccineWars.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-report-vaccines-lockdowns-responsible-all-cause-mortality.html,"Report: VACCINES and LOCKDOWNS are responsible for excess all-cause mortality, not COVID-19 infection","Vaccines and lockdowns to address the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are to blame for the excess all-cause mortality during the pandemic , according to a new report. The said report was published by not-for-profit corporation Correlation Canada and was authored by the group's associate researchers Denis Rancourt, Joseph Hickey and Christian Linard. It examined all-cause mortality data in 125 nations between the years 2020 and 2023. The three researchers found that deaths commonly attributed to COVID-19 were actually due to other factors – including lockdowns and, in bitter irony, the injections touted as a solution for the pathogen. According to them, this excess all-cause mortality worldwide is incompatible with a viral respiratory disease as a primary cause of death. ""We describe plausible mechanisms and argue that the three primary causes of death associated with the excess all-cause mortality during (and after) the COVID-19 period are: biological (including psychological) stress from mandates, such as lockdowns and associated socio-economic structural changes; non-COVID-19-vaccine medical interventions , such as mechanical ventilators and drugs; and COVID-19 vaccine injection rollouts , including repeated rollouts on the same populations,"" they wrote. Writing for Armageddon Prose , Ben Bartee commented on the second cause of death. He pointed out that ""based on reports from countless nurses and other frontline healthcare providers,"" the scheme involved putting COVID-19 patients on ventilators knowing fully aware that they won't make it. Another scheme, Bartee noted, was the administration of the dangerous drug midazolam on COVID-19 patients and listing the cause of death as COVID-19 infection. (Related: UK covering up THOUSANDS of COVID-19 vaccine deaths.) Hospitals incentivized to hook COVID-19 patients to ventilators ""Let's not be naive enough to delude ourselves into believing it was a coincidence that the hospitals were given a financial incentive to throw maximum numbers of grannies on ventilators,"" Bartee continued. According to the Thailand-based commentator, hospitals' payout from Medicare tripled when they did so. This was on top of the special 20 percent bonus for COVID-19 patients courtesy of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. According to WRAL News , the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) estimated that the average Medicare payment for a less severe hospitalizations is at $13,297. A hospitalization where a patient is hooked to a ventilator for at least 96 hours is at $40,218. KFF's estimate is roughly the same as numbers given by former Minnesota State Sen. Scott Jensen, a Republican, during an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News . According to him, a hospital gets paid $13,000 if a COVID-19 patient on Medicare is admitted and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator. Jensen, a physician by profession, remarked that doctors are being encouraged to cite COVID-19 as a cause of death on death certificates – suggesting money as a motivation. ""A COVID-19 patient on a ventilator will need more services and more complicated services, not just the ventilator,"" said Joseph Antos, scholar in health care at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It is reasonable that a patient who is on a ventilator would cost three times one who isn’t that sick."" Medicare will pay hospitals a 20 percent ""add-on"" to the regular DRG payment for (COVID-19) patients. That’s a result of the CARES Act, the largest of the three federal stimulus laws enacted in response to the coronavirus, which was signed into law March 27.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-canadas-assisted-suicide-regime-become-conveyor-belt.html,Canada’s assisted suicide regime has become a conveyor belt of horror stories,"I have many fears about Canada’s euthanasia regime. I am afraid that the activists at Dying with Dignity will succeed in explicitly expanding eligibility to children, the disabled, and those suffering from mental illness. I am afraid that families will one day be powerless to stop their mentally suffering loved ones from obtaining a lethal injection, and that the force of the state will stop them from intervening. I am afraid that Canada’s radical leftist judiciary will strike down attempts to limit our euthanasia regime. (Article by Jonathon Van Maren republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) But what I am most often afraid of is that we will become numb to the steady conveyer belt of horror stories that arrive almost weekly now – that the sheer volume of these stories will eventually cease to shock us, and that we will accept them as the norm not because we morally approve but because, like our tacit acceptance of abortion until birth, we simply become used to this new status quo. For example, on July 19 I interviewed Roger Foley , a Canadian with disabilities, for LifeSiteNews. He explained how medical professionals have consistently brought up assisted suicide as an option for him, even when he has admitted that he feels suicidal. On July 10, I covered the story of Tracy Polewczuk , a woman who suffers from spina bifida. She was offered assisted suicide twice, and like Foley, explained that the pro-active offering of a lethal injection profoundly impacted her. They are not the only ones – we have been hearing these stories for years. They leak out of our medical institutions like blood seeping under a clinic door. Heather Hancock, a Canadian with cerebral palsy, wrote an op-ed for the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition revealing that a nurse in Alberta told her “to do the right thing and consider MAiD,” Canada’s assisted suicide program. She, too, has been encouraged to accept medicalized killing multiple times. Since the legalization of assisted suicide, she wrote, there has been a change in how she is treated: In [the] hospital, I discovered a change in the attitudes of nurses, doctors, orderlies, and therapists. There was a subtle undercurrent that was almost tangible. I had nurses neglecting me, forcing me to try and walk while they stood at a distance and watched with arms crossed. It was evident the medical staff preferred not to treat me. In 2018, she was asked by a doctor at Victoria General Hospital if she’d ever considered assisted suicide. In 2019, at the same hospital, she was offered assisted suicide once again. To escape the medical system in British Columbia, Hancock moved to a town on the Saskatchewan-Alberta border. After a fall, she was taken to the hospital in Medicine Hat, where during a three-week stay, a nurse came to her bed and advised her to opt for assisted suicide. “If I were you, I would take it in a heartbeat,” the nurse said. “You’re not living, you’re existing.” Hancock was horrified and told the nurse she would never choose assisted suicide and that her “life has value and no human being has a right to say otherwise.” Stories like those of Foley, Polewczuk, Hancock, and many others should be deeply disturbing to us – they are indicative of a human rights crisis that has grown at a breathtaking pace over the past few years. Suffering, sick, and disabled Canadians are constantly being offered assisted suicide when they are at their most vulnerable, while Dying with Dignity activists and euthanasia advocates such as Dr. Ellen Wiebe claim that all is well in Canada’s killing regime. Because the truth is so horrible, many people prefer to listen to these reassuring voices. The alternative is to recognize that Canadians are being bullied into lethal injections in places of care. Despite all this, the Canadian press is now campaigning to see the last safe spaces for the suffering removed. A key goal of the euthanasia activists is to force all institutions – religious or not – to offer and conduct lethal injections on site. First suicide became a “right”; offering it has become an obligation. And so we get stories with titles like this , from CTV: “A B.C. woman turned to MAID for peace. Her family says her death was undignified, traumatic.” The parents and doctor of a woman who died by euthanasia are suing both Providence Health Care and the B.C. government because she had to transfer out of St. Paul’s Hospital to get a lethal injection. The CBC followed that story with another report focused on Providence Health Care: “Providence Health reveals 19 patients were forced to transfer this year due to its MAID policy.” Notice the framing of the story – no patient was “forced” to do anything. Some hospitals don’t kill people, and so if you are seeking a lethal injection, you must transfer elsewhere. The CBC chose not to speak to disability advocates or others who could have highlighted the extreme importance of euthanasia-free places – instead, they spoke with University of Ottawa professor Daphne Gilbert, who worked with Dying with Dignity Canada on a legal challenge to force hospitals to offer it on-site. “Dying with Dignity” is described, absurdly, as a “human-rights charity.” Canada’s journalists should, at this point, know how disastrous legal euthanasia has been. They have reported many of the abuses; they have surely read coverage of the abuses published right across the anglosphere. But they have not learned their lesson. Once again, they are doing the bidding of Canada’s euthanasia activists and exploiting the pain of the dying to force killing into the last safe places in the country. Read more at: LifeSiteNews.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-olympics-swimmers-forced-to-swim-feces-infested-waters.html,Olympics swimmers forced to swim through HUMAN FECES-infested waters in Paris after opening ceremony mocked Christianity,"Following a controversial opening ceremony now being condemned by the Christian community, Paris Olympics 2024 organizers are facing global embarrassment as the first swimming training session for triathletes competing was canceled because of the disgusting, possibly human feces-infested polluted River Seine. But despite the concerns, the men's and women's triathlon went ahead on Wednesday, July 31, a day later than the initial schedule, near the historic Pont Alexandre III bridge amid a slight drizzle and gray skies. France's Cassandre Beaugrand bagged gold in the women's event, while Julie Derron of Switzerland and Beth Potter of Great Britain won silver and bronze. British triathlete Alex Yee won gold in the men's event. The said body of water has been previously reported to be the site of the swimming portion of triathlon competitions as well as open-water swimming events. The swimming leg of the Olympics triathlon was set to take place in its waters on July 30 (but took place on July 31) and Aug. 5, followed by the open-water swimming on Aug. 8 to 9. Earlier in July, Paris Mayor Ann Hidalgo plunged into the murky waters of Seine in her goggles and a wet suit and swam breaststroke under bright sunshine before immersing her face and beginning a front crawl, covering about 100 meters downstream. After a while senior local officials and Paris Games Chief Organizer Tony Estanguet joined in. Hidalgo now boasts on Instagram, admitting that ""it was a bold gamble…We wanted to put Paris on show! This morning, the triathletes did it. We kept our promise!"" She also paid tribute to France's Beaugrand's victory, posting on her stories: ""The incredible Cassandre Beaugrand has made history…How emotional to see her swimming in the Seine, thank you for making us so proud."" Reports reveal that the organizers have spent more than $1.5 billion trying to overcome the river's high levels of E.coli bacteria . Earlier this month, the river passed the series of tests and was deemed to be clean enough for the swimming competitions but the recent heavy rainfall has set that back. In a joint statement, Paris 2024 and World Triathlon earlier said they were ""confident that water quality will return to below limits before the start of the triathlon competitions."" While the biking and running training sessions went on as scheduled, the swimming training didn't happen. The Seine was supposed to be a training site for athletes over the weekend and two straight days of canceled practice left prospective competitors unable to prepare for arguably the most grueling part of a triathlon. Meanwhile, USA Today reported American triathlete Seth Rider's unconventional and unhygienic strategy for preparing for the Seine's E. coli levels. ""We actually raced here last year in the test event,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone got sick after that, which can't be said about all the races we do. In preparation for this race, I knew there was going to be some E.coli exposure. So I've been trying to increase my E.coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E.coli in day-to-day life."" He said he has not been washing his hands after he goes to the bathroom. Olympics opening ceremonies' ""naked blue man"" claims his performance was a ""message for peace"" When the Paris 2024 Olympics opened, a lot of spectators were shocked at the show's ""The Last Supper"" parody, which featured a naked blue guy named Philippe Katerine, a French entertainer who claimed to be playing the Greek god of wine Dionysus, and several drag artists. During the performance, he sang a song while lying on a table, appearing to be fully naked and covered head-to-toe in glittery blue paint. In an interview with CNN , Katerine said his song ""Nu"" or ""Naked"" was a message for peace , inspired by war, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine. ""Would there have been wars if we'd stayed naked? The answer is perhaps no because you can't hide a gun or a dagger when you're naked,"" he said. ""So you've got this idea of harmlessness when it comes to the naked man. And the idea of the origins of the Olympic Games in Greece, which are represented today because when you see paintings, they're of naked athletes too, also with the idea that they can't carry weapons when they're naked."" Katerine said he was ""deeply sorry"" if his appearance shocked people but confirmed it was never his intention and the fallout has been driven by a ""misunderstanding."" ""I was brought up as a Christian and the best thing about Christianity is forgiveness. For me, it's the most beautiful thing there is: forgiveness,"" he added. ""So I ask for forgiveness if I have offended anyone, and the Christians of the world will grant me that, I'm sure and will understand that it was mostly a misunderstanding. Because when it comes down to it, it wasn't about representing 'the Last Supper' at all."" Olympic organizers have also apologized for the scandalous welcome ceremonies after it was criticized by the Catholic church and Christian groups. As per the French Catholic Church, the festivities ""included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity."" (Related: Paris Olympics officials issue half-hearted apology after worldwide outrage over woke Last Supper parody .) The Games spokesperson Anne Descamps claimed that there was ""clearly never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,"" while the director of the opening ceremony, Thomas Jolly, insisted that ""The Last Supper,"" which was painted by Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, was not the inspiration behind the scene.

They fund upheaval, extremism, violence, hate, satanism, bioterrorism, disease creation, adulterated food and of course, bad medicine. These days, dirty vaccines are more than just a cause of cancer and autism, now the mRNA clot shots cause entire human systems to break down, shut down and terminate life. This is by design. This is no accident, or byproduct of some other industry or “side effect” of a medicine that should have been further investigated and tested. This was planned, and it was planned out very well, as it was funded by millions of dollars through NIH, CCP and the insidious Vaccine Industrial Complex. Gain of function was also planned and designed. It was no accident that coronavirus jumped from bats to humans, and from humans to humans. It would be a conspiracy theory to say that the China Flu developed in the wild, and this has been proven by scientists in laboratories that can dissect genetic coding. This is vaccine violence, as the Covid clot shots literally cause clotting in the vascular system, which spreads to vital organs and the brain and strains the heart to the point of death. It’s called bioterrorism, and the United States, unfortunately, spearheads the living nightmare, along with the Chinese Communist Party. Follow the bouncing science money ball. Believe it or not, there are a handful of billionaires who fund most of the mayhem across the globe, and especially for the United States. These business tycoons function like Adolf Hitler, but they hide behind fronts like “philanthropy” and “technology.” Bill Gates wants to inject everyone with deadly “vaccines” to bring the world’s population down a few billion humans. He’s even said the “quiet part” out loud at TED conferences . George Soros funds the overthrow of governments around the world, and profits from the battles and wars, no matter who wins, loses or just suffers. Top politicians in the U.S. government propagate unnecessary wars around the world to launder billions of dollars, through arms dealing, embezzlement schemes and other common tactics of the military industrial complex. This is nothing new; however, by funding Ukraine and supplying them with long range missiles to shoot deep into Russian territory, this is instigating World War III. What most Americans do not realize is that NATO is a cover for communist aggression, bio-warfare technology and chemical weapons that can easily exterminate billions of human lives in the blink of an eye. Top 5 designed and implemented events that have nearly destroyed the United States and the rest of the world along with it #1. Coronavirus (and other gain-of-function viruses to be released) #2. Covid mRNA clot shots #3. Mass illegal immigration of criminals and terrorists at the U.S. southern border #4. U.S./NATO aid fueling Ukraine’s War against Russia, instigating World War III #5. Trump assassination attempt Twenty some years ago, Americans were all worried about terrorists from the Middle East , who somehow entered our country, learned how to fly commercial jets, took over a few of them and flew them directly into the nation’s most popular buildings. Now, thousands of terrorists just like those guys enter the US in droves, through our open southern border and are given visas, ID, travel money and voting rights by the Obamala Harris, O’Biden Regime. As of late, the one man who may actually be able to close the southern U.S. border, end the insane wars overseas and restore the power of the U.S. constitution, well, he was nearly assassinated by the Deep State. This was well planned by several people and several organizations colluding to further empower evil forces that want to depopulate the planet and enslave us all.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-analyst-harris-coronation-demonstrates-america-democratic-deficit.html,"“Coronation” of Kamala Harris as democratic presidential nominee demonstrates America’s democratic deficit, analyst warns","An analyst has argued that the Democratic Party's ""coronation"" of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace President Joe Biden as the presidential nominee demonstrates America's deepening democratic deficit . Former Green Party vice-presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka put down this argument in a July 24 op-ed published in Black Agenda Report (BAR) . According to him, Biden's withdrawal was ""a gangster move by the oligarchs that control the Democrats."" ""The replacement of Biden as the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party was a dramatic demonstration that the lords of capital are the only segment of the U.S. population with real agency,"" Baraka wrote. ""The fact that select oligarchs – in this case, the cabal that actually runs the [Democratic] Party – can remove a presidential nominee and expeditiously anoint Harris as his replacement cannot be characterized as anything else but a coup. The gangster move by the oligarchs that control the Democrats stripped away any pretense that any real structures of democracy exist in that party."" (Related: Democrats quietly prepping to anoint a NEW nominee that’s NOT Kamala Harris – who will it be? ) According to Baraka, this plot reflects a calculated move to maintain control over the political narrative and ensure the continuation of the oligarchs' preferred agenda. He added that the same forces that orchestrated the 2020 Democratic primaries are behind this plot to crown Harris as the party's new nominee. Harris' appointment suggest continuity rather than change, based on her previously demonstrated alignment with the neoliberal agenda. Her policies and perspectives are expected to reflect those of her predecessor, with no significant departure from the established trajectory of U.S. domestic and foreign policy. ""There was nothing about her policies, worldview or vision because she has no independent policies, worldview, and certainly no vision beyond the agenda that the party and Biden administration have been committed to over the last three and a half years,"" Baraka stated. Biden's cognitive decline clearly showed HE WASN'T VIABLE Baraka, also an editor and contributing columnist for BAR , suggested in the article that Biden’s cognitive decline and inefficacy had made it clear for nearly two years that he would not be a viable candidate for 2024. ""For almost two years, it seemed obvious that Biden would not be a credible candidate in 2024 due to his noticeable cognitive decline and the ineptitude of his administration. [I] assumed that the decision was made as early as 2023 by the party bosses and Biden, but could not be made public because he would immediately become a lame-duck president."" The former Green Party candidate wasn't alone in his sentiments toward the Democratic Party, however. Writer and activist Margaret Kimberley also echoed these during a July 25 appearance on Sputnik 's ""The Critical Hour."" ""They pushed Biden through, they rigged it for him four years ago. They lied about his health for the past four years, told us not to believe our lying eyes when we could see his declining state of health. And when they saw the failure of their plan, they unceremoniously shoved him under the bus,"" said Kimberley, who serves as BAR 's executive editor. ""[The] Democratic Party [is] going to have a presidential nominee who nobody voted for to be president. If this happened anywhere else in the world, we'd call it a banana republic. We see how undemocratic the system is, how undemocratic the Democratic Party is."" Visit KamalaHarris.news for similar stories. Watch Florida Gov.

The emails were part of the latest set of documents obtained by America First Legal (AFL) via litigation against the public health agency. These documents reveal further evidence of collusion between the CDC and social media companies to stiffen free speech under the government’s label of ""misinformation"" and twist and shape the public narratives. The documents released by AFL shows how the CDC worked with the social media platform, referencing in particular an email chain between the agency and Facebook. The platform owned by Mark Zuckerberg sent draft content to the CDC for approval. (Related: The censorship boomerang .) In the exchange, Facebook's Genelle Adrien emailed CDC Digital Media Director Carol Crawford asking for approval of an ""FAQ Content"" section on Facebook's ""COVID-19 Information Center. The information centered on the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""Of concern to Adrien was particularly what the platform's users should be allowed to say about the vaccine's side effects. And CDC provided that guidance – some words were replaced, and other sentences were removed,"" LifeSiteNews wrote. Crawford responded by making a few changes to the content. The ""joint pain"" originally listed as a side effect was gone, replaced with ""nausea."" She also asked to remove a line that stated, ""More serious side effects are extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by its vaccine."" According to the CDC official, the public health agency didn't have ""any cleared language to support"" the statements. Biden admin still encouraging people to get injected According to the pro-life news outlet, ""trying to refute collusive practices involving major social media companies is probably not high on the agenda of the U.S. government right this moment. Nevertheless, the evidence of the highly controversial practice keeps rolling in."" The CDC thereby appears to have admitted that in May 2021, months after the vaccine had already been rolled out, they could not confirm that the vaccine was safer than contracting COVID-19 itself and developing natural immunity. Nonetheless, the CDC continued to push the American people to take the vaccine . There are various ways to interpret this decision, but one is that the CDC by proxy, as Facebook’s guidance adviser, may have wished to avoid the risk of getting sued. Alas, it did get sued by AFL – but for colluding with Facebook. Even though the original language was fairly ""soft"" – if anything, the social platform looked keen to minimize any serious side effects, and promote the vaccines – it was too much for CDC to stand behind. Despite this admission, the Biden administration continued to urge people to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the year. Even President Joe Biden himself joined in the calls, warning that unvaccinated people would ""soon overwhelm hospitals” with “a winter of severe illness and death"" up ahead. ""For [the] unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death – if you’re unvaccinated – for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm,"" the chief executive said at the time.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-big-pharma-admits-mrna-vaccine-causes-cancer.html,Big Pharma admits mRNA vaccine causes CANCER,"Pharmaceutical giants have finally admitted that the experimental mRNA vaccine can cause cancer . The revelation that DNA contamination can lead to birth defects or cancer surfaced when Dr. Robert Malone, the biochemist who helped invent the mRNA vaccine, made an appearance at House of Representatives hearing led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna has a patent that acknowledges RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines due to risks of insertional mutagenesis, which might activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes. ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines,"" Malone stated. ""And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes because problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."" ""FDA [ Food and Drug Administration ] says they're not aware of any concerns, but Moderna, in its patent, lays out the same concerns about DNA in insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity,"" Malone continued. He added that Moderna knew DNA was a contaminant but was left in because of how they make it. ""They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA and then they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA and the process they are using is not that good,"" he said. Another Big Pharma company also eventually acknowledged that its jabs, which were meant to ""cure"" COVID-19, are also contaminated with cancer-causing DNA fragments. In the documentation to regulatory bodies, Pfizer omitted information about the presence of Simian Virus 40 sequences in its vaccine. The documentation suggests that there are certain DNA sequences present in the vials that are normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans, ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene,"" Malone explained. “They include these sequences from SV 40 – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences – which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis.” He added that the FDA did not take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps and look at them themselves. Instead, they took for granted what Pfizer had given them. “And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found,” he further said. Malone warned that the potential consequences for jab recipients are ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones."" (Related: Moderna’s mRNA COVID jab 30% more deadly than Pfizer’s, VAERS data shows .) Get ready for the ""updated COVID-19 vaccines"" Despite the recent admission, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s updated vaccine is expected to be available in either August or September. According to public health officials, they preferred the term ""updated vaccines"" in line with the need to formulate a new vaccine every year to match circulating variants like what they did for the flu shot. ""Historically, when we're talking about COVID vaccines, we're talking about boosters that would happen at some time post your previous vaccine,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Now we're targeting annual vaccines for COVID-19 that are similar to flu. It's a reformulation based on what's circulating, and this is why we're talking about an annual campaign rather than a booster."" The updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccines will target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is claimed to be an offshoot of the omicron variant. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available for six-month-old babies and adults while the Novavax vaccine will be available for those aged 12 and older. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Americans receive the updated 2024-25 vaccine when it becomes available. ""CDC recommends everyone ages six months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 this fall and winter whether or not they have ever previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine,"" the CDC website indicated. The updated jab is not considered a booster. ""We have to remember that this virus is constantly changing and that your protection from previous infection or previous vaccines declines over time,"" Brownstein said. ""Making sure that you receive the most updated formulations of vaccine will ensure that you have the most recent protection and we of course assumed that like previous years.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-email-leaks-big-tech-biden-collusion-covid-cdc.html,"Latest email leaks show Big Tech and Biden colluded on COVID narratives, including with CDC and Twitter (now X)","The conservative nonprofit America Legal First (AFL) disclosed new documents this week showing that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) colluded with Twitter (now X), Joe Biden and a number of other Big Tech entities to control the online narrative about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic."" Retrieved through ongoing litigation, the documents highlight May 2021 communications covering the Biden regime's plans to collude with Big Tech about setting the tone and ""managing"" the conversation on the internet about COVID, and specifically about the ""vaccines"" brought into existence through Operation Warp Speed. Facebook conversed back and forth with CDC spokesperson Carol Crawford, who just ""happened"" to also be involved with Twitter's Partner Support Portal. Both Facebook and Twitter were colluding with the White House at the time to censor the online conversation about COVID and COVID ""vaccines."" Described as Twitter's ""secret superpower,"" the Partner Support Portal allowed government-affiliated people like Crawford to participate in the flagging of ""misinformation"" for censorship purposes. (Related: According to censorship expert Mike Benz, the 2020 election was rigged to produce a Biden ""win"" at least seven months in advance of Election Day.) Biden and the CDC lied, and more people died The email chain in question was led by Crawford and someone named Genelle Adrien who worked on Facebook's Politics and Government Outreach Team. AFL discovered in the chain that the CDC approved of Facebook's official ""COVID-19 Information Center FAQ,"" likely because the CDC wrote it. ""Our content specialist, [sic] recently made copyedits to two CDC questions for our new FAQ modules appearing in the COVID-19 Information Center,"" Adrien wrote to Crawford in one of the emails, dated May 4, 2021. ""These are fairly minor edits to what you've already provided, but if you have additional edits, could you please let us know by COB if possible?"" Adrien continued in the same email to notify Crawford that Facebook's official launch date for the COVID-19 Information Center FAQ portal was May 17, 2021, just a few weeks after this communication took place. Adrien expressed concern that some Facebook users might try to warn others about the side effects of COVID jabs, which is why she wanted Crawford and the CDC to create an FAQ section on Facebook that ""debunks"" this ""misinformation."" At first, Facebook was telling the truth to its users about how COVID jabs can cause certain side effects. Then, the list of possible side effects changed to eliminate ""joint pain"" as one of the possibilities and replaced it with ""nausea."" Facebook's softball approach to revealing just the minor side effects of COVID jabs was apparently too much for the CDC which gutted the FAQ of anything that might make the jabs appear dangerous. ""I would suggest deleting everything after the list of side effects,"" Crawford responded in an email to Adrien about the changes the CDC wanted to be made. ""For that bottom text, the first sentence is duplicative of the bulleted list (fever / chills). We don't have any cleared language, as far as I know, to support the second and third sentences."" In other words, the CDC was proofreading and editing all COVID jab information on Facebook to ensure it complied with the CDC's official narrative of ""safe and effective"" for all COVID injections. As all of this was happening, the Biden regime continued to push Americans to get jabbed over and over again, including with the latest ""booster"" shots. Biden personally started fearmongering that unvaccinated people would ""soon overwhelm hospitals"" with ""a winter (2021 / 22) of severe illness and death"" unless more Americans agreed to get jabbed. ""The CDC appears to have admitted that in May of 2021, months after the vaccine had already been rolled out, they could not confirm that the vaccine was safer than contracting COVID-19 itself and developing natural immunity,"" AFL says. ""Nonetheless, the CDC continued to push the American people to take the vaccine."" Will the powers that be (TPTB) successfully steal another election for their preferred candidate?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-top-8-reasons-the-establishment-hates-trump.html,Top 8 reasons the “establishment” hates Trump so badly,"A survey conducted this past February found that the top concerns for Americans heading into the November elections were inflation, immigration, poor leadership, federal spending, hunger and homelessness, crime reduction, and the fear of terrorist attacks. Since Resident Biden has (illegally) occupied the Oval Office over the past 3.5 years, we’ve all been decimated by inflation across the board, including for fuel, food, insurances, travel, supplies and other necessities. It’s an ongoing horror story. Just since Resident Biden took office 3.5 years ago, we’ve watched 15 million illegal immigrants stroll right into the United States , with money, transportation and no vetting, thanks to the Democrats’ open border policy. It’s a complete living nightmare, as many of these illegals have criminal histories, deal drugs, commit new crimes and almost entirely get away with it, thanks to liberal judges and D.A.s (funded by Soros). Since Dementia Joe snuck into office, trillions of dollars have been printed and gone missing, while the U.S. funds senseless wars overseas, fake “green energy” companies that go bankrupt and the mass-terrorist infiltration from our southern border. That brings us to the main reasons “Big Brother” hates Donald J. Trump so much, and why the fake news industrial complex has convinced nearly every loyal Democrat and Liberal that Trump is the #1 enemy of the State, an “existential threat” that needs to be “stopped at all costs” or “assassinated” in order to “save democracy.” Top 8 reasons the “establishment” hates Trump so badly and wishes he had not survived the attempted assassination #1. Trump is a multi-billionaire, so he’s not interested in embezzling billions of dollars via the Military Industrial Complex (that’s why he’s not a war monger). #2. Trump calls out the Fake News Industrial Complex, which reveals so many of the government’s scams, plots and unconstitutional control-tripping schemes. #3. Trump knows that the whole “ climate change ” movement is a Ponzi scheme, and that “ Green Energy ” is just a Leftist plot to launder billions in taxpayer funds. #4. Trump questions the toxicity of vaccines and getting too many too close together as a baby and developing child, suggesting (correctly) this as a cause of autism. #5. Trump is NOT pushing anything fascist or communist that supports police-state tyranny or depopulation. #6. Trump is NOT a gun grabber. #7. Trump aims to expose Deep State prerogatives and corruption, including past, present and future. #8. Trump actually likes America and its citizens and wants the nation to do well. Everyone, including Democrats and Liberals who hate Trump so much that they suffer from TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome), knows that whatever puppet takes Biden’s place will just inflict MORE of the SAME damage we’ve seen for the past 3.5 years. Inflation will double or triple. World War III is likely to begin under Democrat leadership. 15 million new illegal immigrants will enter America, including thousands of terrorists from China and Iran. The psychotic leaders in Washington DC want to end all gas-powered vehicle and equipment use. That means the end of farming as we know it, and mass starvation periods coming up very soon, if the Democrats win in November. They have been very clear about this, and there are NO MACHINES ready to farm America that run on electric power, and even if there were, the whole grid is under attack anyway. We must end this “climate change” cultist scam once and for all. There really is not another choice for saving the Republic, other than voting for Donald Trump and non-RINO Republicans to run Congress. God save the Queen (in this case, it’s King Trump).

In a July 21 post on X, formerly Twitter, President Joe Biden finally yielded to pressure from his fellow Democrats. The 81-year-old Biden announced in his post that he would step aside as the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Harris as his replacement. A few days after the announcement, 1,100 pro-LGBT political leaders endorsed Harris and her bid for the White House. The endorsement letter, reportedly signed by Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, calls on Americans to unite behind Harris to further advance equality. The letter was organized by prominent LGBTQ+ groups, including Advocate for Transgender Equality, Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club, Equality California, the LGBTQ Victory Fund, LPAC, the National LGBTQ Task Force, and others. These organizations are supported by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and the Washington D.C. LGBTQ+ lobbying powerhouse. (Related: Democrats revive Black Lives Matter one day after Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president .) ""As advocates, elected officials, organizations, and community leaders serving millions of LGBTQ+ Americans and our allies across the country, we urge you to join us in this historic moment to advance equality by supporting Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign for President,"" the letter begins. The letter also calls Harris a ""galvanizing trailblazer"" in her commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, recounting her efforts to fight anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes in San Francisco, working to end the gay and transgender ""panic defense"" in California courts and her refusal to defend the Proposition 8 referendum, which banned same-sex marriage in the state for several years. The full list of signatories has not yet been made public. ""The (LGBTQ+) community is sending a message loud and clear: we are united in support of the experienced, tough, pro-equality Vice President Kamala Harris and will do everything it takes to defeat Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said. Harris launches her presidential campaign on Ru Paul's Drag Show In line with the endorsement, Harris seemingly launched her campaign on the season nine finale of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars. The short video clip taped a few weeks ago showed the vice president joined by garish, cartoonish and outlandish show regulars. Harris passionately addressed the audience in a preview of the July 26 season nine finale, posted on X. ""Each day we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride. So, as we fight back against these attacks, let’s all remember: No one is alone. We are all in this together,"" she said, quoting a popular song from Disney’s 2009 movie, High School Musical, a favorite of gay audiences. ""Your vote is your power.

The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics on July 26 featured multiple performances, including one in which a diverse group of individuals, including drag queens, trans individuals and a nude singer, copied the biblical scene of the Last Supper as depicted by Da Vinci, with Jesus Christ at the center and the 12 apostles flanking Him. The portrayal was widely condemned. The Catholic Church in France described the depiction as a grave insult and a mockery of Christianity . Archbishop of Malta Charles Scicluna, who also serves as a high-ranking member of the Vatican's main doctrinal office – the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith – expressed his disappointment over the parody and announced that his office had already expressed its grievances to France's ambassador to Malta. ""I would like to express my distress and great disappointment at the insult to us Christians during the opening ceremony … when a group of drag artists parodied the Last Supper of Jesus,"" the archbishop wrote on X. (Related: Thousands of applicants for Olympics-related jobs rejected due to terror links and security threats .) Similarly, the Vatican's President of the Pontifical Academy for Life Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia noted that ""the mockery of the Last Supper"" at the Paris Olympics raises profound questions about respect for religious sentiments. In response to the backlash, Paris Olympics spokesperson Anne Descamps apologized to the Catholic Church and other Christian groups at a news conference on July 28. ""Clearly, there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. [The opening ceremony] tried to celebrate community tolerance,"" Descamps said on July 28. ""We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we are really sorry."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also addressed the controversy and welcomed the clarification from the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee. ""In the daily press briefing, the Organizing Committee said that there was never any intention to show disrespect towards any religious group or belief. They reiterated that their intention with the Opening Ceremony was always to celebrate community and tolerance,"" the statement read. The IOC added that the intention was not to offend anyone and that ""they were sorry."" IOC apologized for another mistake during the Olympics — introducing South Korean athletes as athletes from North Korea The organizers of the Olympic Games issued another formal apology after they mistakenly introduced South Korean athletes as athletes from North Korea . Part of the opening ceremony is what is known as the ""Parade of Nations,"" during which participating athletes march into the main Olympic stadium and are introduced to the world. In this year's parade, athletes were first paraded by boat along the River Seine and then in the Jardins du Trocadero stadium. When it was the turn of the South Korean delegation to be introduced, they were mistakenly introduced as athletes from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea, instead of the Republic of Korea. This misidentification occurred despite the blue sign on the boat correctly displaying ""Republic of Korea"" and the athletes on the boat proudly waving South Korean flags. In response to the incident, Jang Mi Ran, the second vice minister of South Korea’s Culture, Sports and Tourism Ministry, requested a meeting with IOC President Thomas Bach. The ministry also urged South Korea’s Foreign Ministry to file a strong government-level complaint with the French government. Additionally, South Korea’s Olympic committee has asked the organizers of the Paris Games to take steps to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Thomas Bach personally called South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to apologize for the incident. President Yoon expressed that the South Korean people were ""very shocked and embarrassed"" and requested that Bach apologize publicly via media and social media and take measures to prevent a recurrence of such errors. Bach assured President Yoon that he would take all necessary steps to avoid repeating the mistake. IOC spokesperson Mark Adams described the error as ""clearly deeply regrettable"" and attributed it to an operational mistake. ""We can only apologize, in an evening of so many moving parts, that this mistake was made,"" Adams responded to a question from a South Korean journalist during a news conference. ""We deeply apologize for the mistake that occurred when introducing the Korean team during the opening ceremony broadcast,"" the IOC posted on X in Korean.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-paris-olympics-drag-queens-mocking-last-supper.html,Paris Olympics opening marred by DRAG QUEENS making a mockery of “The Last Supper”,"Drag queens took center stage at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the same homosexual performers making a mockery of Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper."" The opening ceremony dubbed Tour de Farce included a drag queen version of ""The Last Supper,"" a strongly suggested bisexual threesome and a scantily-clad, bearded drag queen doing a provocative dance. During the early part of the ceremony, viewers were shown a sequence where ""three dancers in gender-ambiguous costumes ran through the streets of Paris and into a building. Their segment ended with the three – two males and one female – nearing each other in dramatic kisses, then entering a room to further their amorous acts, Breitbart News reported. ""The segment ended with one of the dancers looking back at the camera and slamming a door in the viewers' faces, making it clear that the three were planning on engaging in more intimate contact."" But perhaps the boldest performance during the opening ceremony was a tableau that mirrored da Vinci's painting. The drag queens took the role of the Apostles, while a fat lesbian took the role of Jesus Christ – a clear blasphemy of the Lord's Passion. (Related: RIVERS OF BLOOD: Alleged Hamas supporter threatens MASS VIOLENCE at Paris Olympics (but it could be a false flag operation.) ) Drag queen Le Filip (born Filip Mrzljak), the recent winner of ""Drag Race France,"" expressed his positive ""surprise"" and ""pride"" at the ceremony's scale and representation. ""The [French] government knows what it's doing. They want to show themselves in the best way possible. They showed no restraints in expression,"" Le Filip told the Associated Press . James Leperlier, president of the French LGBT federation Inter-LGBT, was more circumspect in his comments. He argued that France still has significant strides to make in inclusivity. ""We know in the LGBTQ community in France we are far from what the ceremony showed. There's much progress to do in society regarding transgender people. It's terrible that to legally change their identity, they are forced to be on trial,"" he explained. World treated to degeneracy at Paris Olympics France had promised its opening ceremony would be the biggest open-air show on Earth. More than 300,000 people watched from the riverside and bridges – and hundreds more stood at windows and balconies – as a show of dance, live music and acrobatics unfolded along the stretch of the Seine River from the Pont d'Austerlitz to the Eiffel Tower. But the outdoor ceremony, once described by Emmanuel Macron as ""a crazy idea that must be made real,"" had to overcome obstacles. While it did become a reality, it also drew the ire of Christians who did not take too kindly to the drag queens mocking the Last Supper . Marion Marechal, a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for France, denounced the performance on social media. ""To all the Christians of the world who are watching the Paris 2024 ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation,"" she posted on X.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-kansas-charges-pfizer-misleading-public-covid19-vaccine.html,Kansas legally charges Pfizer for misleading the public about its so-called “COVID-19 vaccine”,"Any person who objected to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines was slandered, censored and de-platformed for spreading deadly “misinformation.” Doctors who warned about the COVID-19 vaccine were stripped of their medical license and ostracized by the medical community. Only one narrative was allowed: that vaccines are ""safe and effective."" During this time of great deception, pharmaceutical giants were openly allowed to exploit the population with their genetic experiments that replicate bioweapons in human cells. Now, after three years of plundering the world with their narratives of fear and control, pharmaceutical companies are facing enormous backlash. Entire states are taking action against the pharmaceutical companies that lied to the American people and the rest of the world. Case in point, the state of Kansas is now charging Pfizer for making multiple false claims and misleading the public about its COVID-19 vaccine. The legal action, submitted to the District Court of Thomas County, accuses Pfizer of breaching the Kansas Consumer Protection Act by misrepresenting the vaccine's effectiveness and hiding known risks. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages from Pfizer, a company that has a felonious record and a history of succumbing to major settlements for perpetrating fraud. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach stated, ""Pfizer made multiple misleading statements to deceive the public about its vaccine at a time when Americans needed the truth."" Vaccines ""are safe and effective"" narrative is crumbling As the vaccine narrative begins the crumble, the world is learning that the “misinformation” about COVID-19 vaccines was perpetrated by the pharmaceutical companies -- not concerned citizens, not watchdog groups and not medical freedom advocates. The companies behind this global experiment knowingly made false claims about a product that had serious, life-threatening risks and no evidence of efficacy. These charges are just the beginning of health freedom advocates being vindicated. First off, Pfizer claims that their product is a “vaccine.” During the rollout of the COVID-19 “vaccines,” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) changed the definition of “vaccine” to accommodate the failures of the mRNA experiment. The CDC's 2018 definition stated that a vaccine is ""a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease."" By September of 2021, the CDC changed that definition to “A preparation that is used to stimulate the body’s immune response against diseases.” Not only does the COVID-19 vaccine fail to produce immunity to a specific disease, but it also fails to protect the individual from the advertised disease and fails to stimulate an enduring immune response against any disease. Kansas charges Pfizer on four counts of misinformation and false claims The concealment of pregnancy risks: Shortly after Pfizer rolled out their product, they hid evidence that linked their vaccine to pregnancy complications , including miscarriage risks and shedding risks that put unvaccinated, pregnant mothers at risk if they are in close quarters with people who were recently vaccinated. Dismissing the risk of heart inflammation: Kansas provides evidence that Pfizer concealed the link between their product and myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation in and around the heart). The initial Pfizer documents detailed these serious risks, and mentioned the risk of antibody dependent enhancement, which causes vaccinated individuals to experience more severe disease when they are exposed to the causative agent later on. Overstating vaccine effectiveness against new coronavirus strains: Kansas also accuses Pfizer of falsely advertising its vaccine as a preventative for future strains of coronavirus. Because coronaviruses rapidly mutate and eventually develop new characteristics, there is no scientific precedent for a vaccine to work definitively against future variants. However, Pfizer maintained that their vaccine was effective against all mutations of the original strain. Misleading the public about preventing transmission: Kansas calls out Pfizer for falsely claiming that their vaccine would prevent a specific disease and stop the transmission of that disease. This falsehood was debunked early on, as “breakthrough cases” became the norm and immunity to infection waned within two months, if it ever existed in the first place. This led to recurrent infections for the vaccinated and severe outcomes that were deceptively and unanimously reported (without evidence) as “milder” compared to an infection in the unvaccinated. With these credible charges now looming, Pfizer must face repercussions for lying , manipulating and deceiving the public about a dangerous and deadly experiment that was coerced onto the world population.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-kamala-harris-lgbt-degeneracy-perversion-transgender-mutilation.html,Kamala Harris loves transgender child mutilation and other degenerate LGBT perversion,"Last summer, Vice President Kamala Harris hosted an LGBTQ+ Pride Month reception at her official Washington, D.C., residence , this marking the second time that a sitting vice president has ever done such a thing – the first one was held in 2022, also by Kamala at her personal D.C. residence. Kamala appeared in the following photo, taken on June 28, 2023, alongside a ""trans woman,"" also known as a biological male, named ""Sasha Colby"" who moonlights as a drag queen. Drag queens were featured front and center at Kamala's 2022 pride shindig, as well as again at this year's 2024 pride celebration. On all three pride occasions, Kamala made sure to prominently feature drag queens in order to keep them at the forefront and in the spotlight as part of her agenda. Kamala also loves bringing drag queens to public schools where innocent children are exposed to their perversions. Kamala openly supports two new laws signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that allow teachers and administrators to deceive or keep secret from parents their children's ""trans"" or ""gay"" identities, all the while giving instructors free rein to indoctrinate children into the Cult of LGBTQ+ in the classroom. The second Newsom law Kamala supports allows parents from other states where such abominations are prohibited to come to California to undergo ""transition"" procedures there instead, even if a child's other parent opposes the mutilations. (Fact check: Joe Biden did appoint Kamala Harris to be America's open borders czar.) Kamala Harris has never prosecuted a single case of sexual abuse by pedophiles Those familiar with Kamala's political career know that she used to be District Attorney of San Francisco as well as Attorney General of California. In neither position did Kamala ever even once prosecute a case of child sexual abuse by pedophiles. Not only did Kamala let pedophiles off the hook, she also went a step further to protect them by hiding their records showing sex crimes against children. In other words, Kamala loves pedophiles and could be one herself . Kamala has further ties to a political action committee (PAC) called the DRAG PAC that has as its mission to ""educate, invigorate and motivate the LGBTQ voter base."" ""DRAG PAC is a collective of DRAG entertainers and seasoned queer professionals who have banded together to educate, invigorate and motivate the LGBTQ voter base,"" the highly corrupt ActBlue donations website explains. The DRAG PAC is expected to donate large sums of cash to the Kamala campaign since Kamala is one of the LGBTQ+ community's loudest supporters. Kamala also wants the federal government to eliminate all biological links to sex and gender by recognizing transgenderism, also known as gender dysphoria, as normal rather than a sign of serious mental illness. ""Take careful note of the type of person that Kamala is,"" one commenter wrote. Another quoted Romans 1:28-32 as a description of Kamala's voter base: ""And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them."" ""Can anyone find a righteous man (or woman) in D.C.?"" asked another. ""This sickness has permeated everything."" More related news about the LGBTQ+ takeover of the world, visit Transhumanism.news .

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-vigano-criticism-olympics-mocked-christianity.html,Archbishop Vigano joins growing chorus of criticism of Olympics opening ceremony that mocked Christianity,"Archbishop Vigano, who was recently excommunicated by the Catholic Church for bravely speaking out against its sexual abuse and woke ideology, has issued a statement deriding the Paris Olympic Games for its “vile attacks on God, the Catholic Religion, and natural Morality.” After describing the ridiculous performance that mocked the Last Supper , he noted: ""The opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games have given scandal, not only because of the arrogant display of the ugly and the obscene, but because of the infernal subversion of Good and Evil, the insane claim to be able to blaspheme and desecrate everything, even what is most sacred, in the name of an ideology of death, ugliness, and lies that defies Christ and scandalizes those who recognize Him as Lord and God.” He called on Christians around the world to boycott the Olympics and all of their sponsors, in addition to asking delegations and athletes to withdraw. He also said that the “homosexual set designer who gave birth to this blasphemous and vulgar spectacle” should return French taxpayers’ money. Critics slam Olympics opening ceremony Even those within the LGBT community took issue with the performance’s disrespect for religion. Fitness expert Jillian Michaels slammed the ceremony , writing on X: ""Dear fellow gays… We demand tolerance and respect but then make a mockery of something sacred for over 2 billion Christians. ""This type of hypocrisy and lack of understanding is a bad look. We get outraged when the extreme right bashes us, but then we do this s---. What kind of reaction do you think they will have towards the LGBTQ+ community after this. This is NOT how we break down barriers, it's how you build them,"" she added. A group of more than two dozen Republicans have sent a letter demanding the Olympics rewrite its charter to “ensure that no faiths are the subject of mockery.” The lawmakers wrote: “There is no place for anti-Christian bigotry at an event designed to bring the world together. The Games should celebrate the athletes, not denigrate anyone's faith.” Countless others have joined the chorus of outrage, with Elon Musk calling the display “extremely disrespectful to Christians” and competitive swimmer Riley Gaines writing: “Men in wigs front & center at the Olympic Games. No one ever tell me this group is ‘oppressed’ or ‘marginalized’ again.” Former President Donald Trump called it a “disgrace,” while his son, Donald Trump Jr. called it “seemingly satanic.” Organizers issue a weak apology, but they knew exactly what they were doing A spokesperson for Paris 2024 issued a weak apology, telling reporters: “Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. If people have taken any offense we are, of course, really, really sorry.” And while they are acting like they’re surprised by the reaction, the fact is that they mocked one of the most sacred moments in a faith practiced by more than 2.4 billion people around the world. Backlash was inevitable, and they had to know this would sow division rather than unity. Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota accused Olympics organizers of a double standard , asking: “Would they ever have dared mock Islam in a similar way? Would they have ever dreamed of mocking in this gross public way a scene from the Koran? We all know the answer to that.” “This deeply secularist post-modern society knows who its enemy is. They’re naming it. And we should believe them,” he added. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-survival-dental-care-keeping-teeth-clean-shtf.html,Survival dental care: Keeping your teeth clean and healthy when SHTF,"Maintaining proper oral health even after SHTF is important because it helps keep your teeth and gums healthy and your breath fresh. For emergencies, you can clean your teeth with toothpaste substitutes such as baking soda or even coconut oil. (h/t to SurvivalJack.com ) Here are some options if you don't have an extra supply of toothbrushes and toothpaste for the whole family when SHTF: Wash your hands thoroughly, but don't dry them. Use a wet finger to rub across your teeth and gums on one side. Rinse your finger thoroughly and repeat the second step on the other side of your teeth. Gargle with clean water. When you're done, wash your hands thoroughly. Toothpaste substitutes for emergencies Before disaster strikes, you should stock up on oral care products such as toothsalt with neem oil or fluoride-free toothpaste and extra toothbrushes. But if you are looking for other options, here are some toothpaste substitutes to try : Activated charcoal Remember that activated charcoal is not the same as charcoal for your barbecue grill. Activated charcoal is made from materials such as coconut shells or wood that have been burned at very high temperatures (1,110 and 1,650 F) and processed further to create a charcoal powder. You should also note that activated charcoal is not recommended for crowns or veneers because it can permanently stain the surface of your teeth. In a survival situation, a toothbrush is more important than toothpaste so you can use a frayed twig alone (via the dry brushing method) without charcoal. When making your own toothbrush from a twig, you need to mash or cut a clean, soft stick to mimic a toothbrush. Find a flexible twig such as pine, spruce or willow. Whittle away the bark, and square off one end of the stick. Make five to six cuts 1/4-inch deep into the end. Turn the stick 90 degrees, and make five to six more cuts. Hammer, crush or chew the ""bristles"" to soften them. Carefully brush each tooth with a downward sweeping motion. If you have clean water, gargle after ""brushing."" Baking soda To clean your teeth with baking soda , place a small amount on your toothbrush and brush your teeth. Rinse with water. Alternatively, you can dissolve the baking soda in water and dip your toothbrush in the mixture and start brushing. This method works well with a chewing stick. Coconut oil Coconut oil is a good substitute for toothpaste. Just dip your toothbrush in coconut oil and brush. (Related: Prepper oral health: How to clean your teeth and prevent cavities when SHTF .) Sea salt Sea salt has cleansing properties but it can be too abrasive if you brush with plain salt. Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in half a cup of water. Dip your toothbrush in the salt water and brush your teeth.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-stanley-plotkin-vaccines-safety-never-adequately-studied.html,“Godfather of Vaccines” now admits safety of injections has never been adequately studied,"Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who has gained the moniker ""Godfather of Vaccines,"" has admitted that vaccine safety is a field that has not been adequately studied for decades . LifeSiteNews pointed out that ""for decades, the medical community insisted vaccines are the most thoroughly studied product ever."" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration 's (FDA) vaccine advisory committee, once said: ""I think we should be proud of vaccines as arguably the safest, best tested things we put in our body."" But according to attorney Aaron Siri, managing partner of the Siri & Glimstad law firm, those who suffer from vaccine injuries beg to differ. He said that ""for decades, parents of vaccine injured children, vaccine injured adults and other stakeholders have contested these claims."" These victims, Siri added, have been ""shunned and attacked by the medical community and health agencies."" Plotkin developed the vaccine to stop rubella (German measles), which caused tens of thousands of severe birth defects in the U.S. alone, in the 1960s. He went on to work on the vaccines for polio, rabies, anthrax and rotavirus. Plotkin's influence stretches to the present day, with him being named as a consultant for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. (Related: Longtime pro-jab apologist finally comes clean about lack of science proving vaccine safety .) Siri recounted that in 2018, he had the chance to depose Plotkin. But following this deposition, the vaccinologist went on a tirade ostensibly in support of vaccine safety. Plotkin urged the FDA to add ""missing information on safety and efficacy"" in vaccine package inserts, and called for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to exclude harms from its vaccine information sheets. He also called for ""lobbying the Gates Foundation to support pro-vaccine organizations"" and working to have the World Health Organization (WHO) list vaccine hesitancy as a global threat. Siri: Don't be fooled by the admissions of Plotkin and his buddies But the lawyer broke down Plotkin's tirades, pointing out that they ""don't work"" as ""there are no proper safety studies"" from square one. ""There is no safety data to add to the FDA package inserts, and hiding harms by removing them from CDC inserts doesn't make them go away. Parents and other adults don't simply stop believing what they have seen with their own eyes because [health authorities] won't acknowledge them, or worse, they attack them,"" said Siri. ""That brings us to the present in which Plotkin and his disciples realize they can't cast voodoo on the public. They can’t hide the truth. So, their only option is to try and co-op the truth they have lied about for decades by admitting that the studies to show vaccines that are safe do not exist . But in making that admission, they conveniently fail to admit that for decades they lied, gaslit, defrauded the public by claiming that vaccines are probably the most thoroughly safety tested products on the planet and that people should rest assured, no stone on vaccine safety was left unturned."" Siri also pointed out that Plotkin and his colleagues ""pretend they never lied about vaccine safety … [and] are now just pointing out vaccine safety [testing] has never really been conducted."" ""Don't be fooled. Their real agenda is plain, and it is not to study vaccine safety, but rather to confirm that which they already believe. This is crystal clear from the fact that, while their article admits the studies have not been done, they write in the same breath that serious vaccine harms are 'rare,'"" he continued. ""But if the studies have not been done, how do they know that? The answer is, they don't, and they don't care to know the truth. Their goal is to protect the products they have spent their careers defending and worshiping and that have brought them fame and riches. They also ignore the mountain of studies and data, which already exist that clearly show serious vaccine harms .""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-french-bishops-condemn-olympic-mockery-of-christianity.html,French bishops condemn Olympic ‘mockery of Christianity’,"The Bishops’ Conference of France has denounced the organizers of the Olympic Games over an LGBTQ-themed parody of the Last Supper during the event's opening ceremony. The organizers have claimed that the performance reflected their “values and principles.” (Article republished from RT.com ) The ceremony, which took place in central Paris on Friday night, concluded with a troupe of drag queens, homosexuals, and transsexuals posing at a table, as Jesus Christ and his apostles appeared in Leonardo Da Vinci’s ‘The Last Supper’. A giant serving dish was then wheeled out in front of the table, from which emerged a mostly naked man made up to resemble Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and festivity. Throughout the performance, a male dancer’s exposed testicles could be seen behind the table. “This ceremony unfortunately included scenes in which Christianity was mocked and ridiculed, which we deeply regret,” the Bishops’ Conference said in a statement on Saturday. “We thank the members of other religious denominations who have expressed their solidarity with us,” the statement continued. “This morning we think of all Christians on all continents who have been hurt by the exaggeration and provocation of some scenes.” The ceremony was condemned by Christians and conservatives around the world. Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota called the performance a “gross mockery of the Last Supper,” while Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini declared that “opening the Olympics by insulting billions of Christians across the world was a really bad start” for France. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk described the spectacle as “extremely disrespectful to Christians,” while tech entrepreneur Dr. Eli David wrote that “even as a Jew,” he was “infuriated by this outrageous insult to Jesus and Christianity.” Olympic organizers have defended the opening show. “We imagined a ceremony to show our values and our principles so we gave a very committed message,” Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet told reporters on Saturday. “The idea was to really trigger a reflection. We wanted to have a message as strong as possible.” “Our idea was inclusion,” added Thomas Jolly, the ceremony’s artistic director. “We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everybody.” Read more at: RT.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-hotez-calls-for-police-military-antivaccine-aggression.html,"Vaccine advocate Peter Hotez calls for use of police, military against ‘anti-vaccine aggression’","Vaccine advocate and pharmaceutical industry insider Dr. Peter Hotez , long a proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine, said he favors deploying police and military powers against “anti-vaxers,” whom he blamed for causing hundreds of thousands of deaths during the pandemic. (Article by Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. republished from ChildrenHealthDefense.org ) During an interview July 5 at the Simposio Internacional de Actualización en Pediatría (International Symposium of Pediatric Updates) in Cartagena, Colombia, Hotez suggested organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and NATO should target “anti-vaccine aggression.” Hotez said: “What I’ve said to the Biden administration is, the health sector can’t solve this on its own. We’re going to have to bring in Homeland Security , the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this. I’ve said the same with — I met with Dr. Tedros [director general of the WHO] last month … to say, I don’t know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own. We need the other United Nations agencies. NATO. This is a security problem because it’s no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression. “And so, this is now a lethal force … and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist … it’s important, just as important for me to make new vaccines, to save lives. The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.” Send in all the militaries to ensure uptake of the sacred vaccines. https://t.co/eRneDbw3eQ — Paul D. Thacker (@thackerpd) July 24, 2024 The full interview was available on YouTube until Wednesday evening, when it was removed. The Defender obtained a video recording of the full interview. Hotez is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University College of Medicine and director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital , one of the sponsors of the symposium, which was organized by the Colombian Pediatric Society . Aside from being a vaccine proponent and developer — he helped develop the Corbevax COVID-19 vaccine which was administered in India and has received at least $30 million in vaccine development grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — Hotez has crusaded against so-called “misinformation” about vaccines. In March, The Hill reported that Hotez has found a “‘parallel career’ fighting misinformation .” Hotez “finds his efforts to combat misinformation to be ‘meaningful,’” and says “pushing back on the anti-vaccine movement is just as important as developing vaccines,” The Hill wrote. Hotez also holds six patents on the hookworm (helminth) vaccine , and has several listed patent applications as well, including those for SARS-CoV2 vaccines. “Peter has cashed in significantly on the COVID-19 pandemic and gets a lot of money when shots go into arms,” said Brian Hooker, Chief Scientific Officer for Children’s Health Defense (CHD). In his July 5 interview, Hotez called for more stringent action against “anti-vaxers,” whom he connected to entities such as the Russian government, and called for medical schools to educate new doctors about anti-vaccine sentiment. “‘Anti-science’ and ‘anti-vaxxer’ are propaganda terms Hotez uses to establish a power dynamic over anyone who disagrees with him,” said cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough . “Now Hotez is calling for a security state to enforce his propaganda instead of engaging in much needed dialogue over vaccine safety with a critical appraisal of short- and long-term side effects from the routine childhood vaccine schedule , including the COVID-19 shots,” McCullough added. According to Harvey Risch, M.D., Ph.D. , professor emeritus and senior research scientist in epidemiology (chronic diseases) at the Yale School of Public Health: “Hotez has spent his entire career developing vaccines which have not achieved success in commercial use. His demands to impose public health martial law are reminiscent of the ‘Comité de salut public’ — ‘ Committee of Public Safety ’ — that Robespierre used to murder his political opponents [during the French Revolution].” For Francis Boyle, J.D., Ph.D. , professor of international law at the University of Illinois, Hotez’s suggestions are a call to violate established international human rights law. “Coercing vaccines upon human beings without their informed and voluntary consent violates the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation , which is a crime against humanity,” Boyle said. “What we see at work here with Hotez is the Nazi mentality that pervades so many vaccinologists like him. Hotez is revealing his true colors.” Independent journalist Paul D. Thacker has investigated Hotez for his site, The Disinformation Chronicle . He said, “This crackpot idea that we should deploy military forces to deal with moms worried about vaccine side effects and children … doesn’t that speak for itself?” Dr. Sukharit Bhakdi , a microbiologist, questioned Hotez’s scientific credentials: “Simple fact: Hotez is not a real scientist. He has never published any research article based on true scientific research. His publications transmit his personal opinions and beliefs. He has not conducted a single valid vaccine trial and has zero data to back his claims. “He has been on the globalist team together with [Dr. Anthony] Fauci et al. and is now turning to violence to silence all dissenters. This very fact disqualifies him as a physician.” “His evolution over the course of the pandemic is curious as he has become more and more shrill as time goes on,” Hooker said. “It seems he is trying to extend his 15 minutes of fame by ‘jumping the shark’ and inciting gestapo-like measures against ‘anti-vaxers’ and ‘science deniers.’ His definition of science is very ‘Fauci-esque’ indeed.” Claim that unvaccinated caused ‘hundreds of thousands’ of deaths ‘an obvious untruth’ During his July 5 interview, Hotez asserted that the unvaccinated were responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said: “There’s anti-vaccine activity in every country, and each has its own unique national flavor. But the part that I’m worried about now is something very dark and accelerating in the United States. “And the most dramatic evidence for that is what happened during the COVID pandemic … My estimate is 200,000 Americans died needlessly because they refused COVID vaccines in 2021, 2022.” Hotez did not provide evidence supporting this figure, but it was similar to claims made by Dr. Anthony Fauci during Congressional testimony last month. Without citing evidence, Fauci said the unvaccinated are “probably responsible for an additional 200,000-300,000 deaths” in the U.S.” Risch called this claim “an obvious untruth.” “In the face of repeated major empirical CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] evidence and CDC’s public acknowledgement that the mRNA vaccines largely failed to reduce COVID transmission, Hotez absurdly claims that people choosing not to vaccinate themselves have contributed more to deaths from COVID than all of the large-scale breakthrough infections among vaccinated people,” Risch said. McCullough said, “Hotez presumes COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective as any vaccinologist would dream. Sadly, his fantasy was over before it started. The COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe and failed to reduce hospitalization and death in prospective randomized trials or in valid observational studies. They never stopped transmission.” “All experts, including Hotez, agreed theoretical protection from COVID-19 vaccines was just a few months, requiring frequent boosters,” McCullough added. Hotez calls parents who choose not to vaccinate their children ‘victims’ In his interview, Hotez called for action — including more censorship — to counter what he called a “dark and accelerating” and “dangerous” anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. and globally that is “expanding and extending to childhood immunizations in the United States.” “My worry is that this anti-vaccine movement, and it’s not misinformation or [an] infodemic, as many call it, it’s organized, it’s deliberate, it’s well-financed and it’s politically motivated … I worry that’s now globalizing to other countries on the African continent, in Asia and even Latin America,” he added. On the topic of childhood vaccinations, Hotez said, “Parents who choose not to vaccinate their kids are victims” of this campaign, and called for medical schools to train doctors on how to respond to parents who oppose vaccinations. “Pediatricians need to understand what the anti-vaccine ecosystem is, how it’s organized, how it operates, and to get educated about it,” he said. “I think that’s a first step … in our medical schools, in our pediatric residency training, in our conferences like this, being able to describe what this anti-vaccine monster looks like.” But for journalist Rodney Palmer , formerly of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the increasing reluctance of parents to vaccinate their children is due to mounting concerns about vaccine safety. He said: “The rising movement questioning the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines appears to be based on mounting evidence from government health data collection agencies and the life insurance industry . “The fraud and cover-up of ivermectin as an effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 caused a segment of the population to question the official guidance around vaccines — more so once they were mandated.” Hotez blamed legacy and traditional media, as well as foreign governments, for fueling anti-vaccine sentiments. “Fox News is now a source of anti-vaccine disinformation,” Hotez said. “If the parents are watching Fox News every night … They are going to be coming into your practice believing disinformation.” Turning to social media, Hotez said, “Twitter, since Elon Musk has taken it over , has become an anti-vaccine site dominated by anti-vaccine groups and individuals who are monetizing the internet. They’re selling fake autism cures because they say vaccines cause autism , which they don’t.” Hotez continues to be active on Twitter — now known as X. Adversarial foreign governments are also to blame for propagating anti-vaccine rhetoric, according to Hotez. “For instance, the Russian government, the Putin government, is spreading anti-vaccine propaganda. The goal of this is to destabilize society and to have caused people to question authority,” he said. Hotez did not provide any information to support this claim. Russia produces the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine , under the auspices of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and The Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology — an arm of the Russian federal government . Hotez calls ‘anti-vaccine movement’ a tool of the ‘far-right’ Hotez also used the interview as an opportunity to plug his upcoming book, “ The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science : A Scientist’s Warning.” He said the book “describes [the anti-vaccine] ecosystem and its political leanings in detail.” According to the book’s publisher, Johns Hopkins University Press, Hotez “explains how anti-science became a major societal and lethal force” and how “the anti-vaccine movement became a tool of far-right political figures around the world.” In 2022, Hotez fiercely criticized looming Congressional hearings into a possible lab-leak origin of COVID-19 and whether the National Institutes of Health (NIH) prematurely discredited the hypothesis, dismissing this as an “ outlandish conspiracy .” However, Hotez’s own 2012 to 2017 NIH grant — totaling $6.1 million — for the development of a SARS vaccine had the aim of responding to any “ accidental release from a laboratory ,” in addition to a possible zoonotic (or natural) spillover of the virus. In a June 2023 interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., CHD’s chairman on leave, podcaster Joe Rogan offered to donate $100,000 to a charity of Hotez’s choice if he agreed to debate Kennedy . Hotez — with the support of several legacy news media outlets and the American Medical Association — refused Rogan’s offer. He later claimed on social media that a “couple of anti-vaxers” “stalked” and “taunted” him outside his home after he declined the offer to debate Kennedy. Read more at: ChildrenHealthDefense.org"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-30-german-cdc-covid-vaccinated-unvaccinated-masks.html,"German CDC’s COVID protocols leaked, revealing vaccinated “suffer more severely” than unvaccinated – masks caused “undesirable side effects”","Journalist Aya Velazquez has dropped a bombshell about the human genocide that occurred through the unleashing of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines."" A whistleblower from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provided Velazquez with the unredacted protocols that were enforced during the ""pandemic"" to basically enslave the world with experimental and extremely deadly chemical injections. The Robert Koch Institute made the following statements during the ""pandemic:"" Jan. 18, 2021: No professional justification for the mask mandate. Masks have undesirable side effects. Aug. 13, 2021: The ""vaccine"" fails in 79% of cases. Aug. 17, 2021: Children are guinea pigs, vaccinated individuals suffer more severely from COVID than unvaccinated individuals. Oct. 26, 2021: The influenza vaccine does not prevent infection. Let's not tell people. Dec. 7, 2022: Unvaccinated individuals are ""essentially immune"" after a COVID infection. How can we present this graphically so that no one notices? These are exact quotes as shared by Dr. Simon Goddek (@goddeketal) on X. They reveal that government health officials knew from the very beginning before they implemented global medical fascism that none of the forced COVID protocols helped people, but instead hurt them. (Related: Did you know that excess deaths only started appearing in Germany after COVID injections were unleashed ?) Who really controls the world? Everything was closely coordinated by an invisible hand throughout the ""pandemic,"" one that had all politicians, left and right, east and west, under its thumb. Who controls that hand? Someone, or some thing , holds so much power over world affairs that it had nearly every key leader and influencer under its spell concerning things like lockdowns and mask and jab mandates. Where did the playbook originate? Ephesians 2 states that ""the prince of the power of the air"" is in control of earthly affairs at the current time. And his wicked spirit is working right now in the children of disobedience to bring about his will. This wicked prince plays both light and dark, Satan and Lucifer, to trick as many as possible into his snare. The conspiracy runs deep, in other words, and those who have figured out the COVID scam are asking the kinds of questions that will eventually expose its deepest, darkest secrets. On X, Stefan Homburg (@SHomburg) responded to Dr. Goddek about the March 25, 2020, protocol in which the Robert Koch Institute hid favorable trends from the public in order to prolong the lockdown for as long as possible. America's own CDC continues to double down on its version of the COVID protocols, which are based on fear and paranoia about floating viruses that can supposedly be stopped by covering your mouth and nose with cloth and taking experimental chemical injections for the rest of your life. ??, ??? ??? ???’? ??? ?? ?? ??? ‘??????????’ - pushing fear, no matter what you have, it’s COVID!

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-30-pro-life-expert-debunks-abortion-restrictions-maternal-deaths.html,Pro-life expert debunks claim that abortion restrictions are linked to maternal deaths,"A recent review by a prominent pro-life researcher disputes the claims of the Commonwealth Fund regarding the impact of pro-life laws on women's health services . On July 18, the Commonwealth Fund, a health care foundation, released a report stating the disparities in women's health and reproductive care across the United States. These disparities are attributed to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision which overturned Roe v. Wade. The report suggests that the decision, which allowed states to enact their own abortion laws, significantly altered access to critical reproductive health services. The report ranked Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas as the lowest-performing states for women's health system performance, while Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire were the highest-ranked. It also noted that states with abortion restrictions, like Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama and Idaho, tend to have fewer maternity care providers. The report claims that these states only have 52 to 56 providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. Commonwealth Fund's scorecard purported to show that pro-life states fare worse in various health metrics , including health insurance coverage, syphilis rates and maternal deaths. It also pointed to widening racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. But a recent review, published in the National Review by Catholic University of America professor and Charlotte Lozier Institutes scholar Michael New, challenges these findings on several fronts. New noted that much of the data used in the Commonwealth Fund's report came from 2022, even though Roe v. Wade was only overturned in June of that year. According to New, this timing issue undermines the validity of its conclusions. (Related: Pro-life organizations in Florida are mobilizing to defeat ballot initiative that seeks to legalize unrestricted abortion in the state .) ""The scorecard does not compare pre-Dobbs data to post-Dobbs data,"" New stated. ""All it shows is that some states with strong pro-life laws fare poorly on some public-health metrics. The problem is that many states with strong protections for the preborn are also states with above-average poverty rates. In general, states with high poverty rates also tend to have below-average public health outcomes. Overall, poverty is a cause of poor public health, not pro-life laws."" Furthermore, New pointed out that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data indicates maternal mortality decreased by 16 percent between 2022 and 2023. He also cites international data associating pro-life protections with better health outcomes for mothers. Democrats and pro-abortion advocates have been blocking pro-life advocates for several years In the past few years, the abortion lobby has been actively working to counter most abortion strategies through various strategies. For instance, in March 2024, the Supreme Court began its oral arguments regarding the Alliance Defending Freedom's lawsuit against the decision of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove the requirement for in-person distribution of abortion pills. Instead, the FDA allowed them to be sent through mail with a prescription . Similarly, in 2022, George Soros funded efforts to support out-of-state abortion seekers in blue states . Democrats codified abortion rights in federal law, increased the distribution of abortion pills by mail, and provided financial assistance for women in pro-life states to travel for abortions. Maryland is one of the states that responded to this need. Baltimore's Democrat Mayor Brandon Scott and the Baltimore chapter of Soros's Open Society Institute (OSI) have pledged a combined $550,000 to the Baltimore Civic Fund. This fund will provide grants to abortion organizations preparing for an influx of out-of-state abortion seekers. Scott has committed to making Baltimore a safe haven for abortion access, with the Baltimore Abortion Fund offering travel, lodging and scheduling assistance to those coming from other states. These pro-abortion strategies have been successful in stoking fear among the general public and using false claims that pro-life laws are dangerous.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-30-olympics-apology-outrage-woke-last-supper-parody.html,Paris Olympics officials issue half-hearted apology after worldwide outrage over woke Last Supper parody,"Paris Olympics organizers have finally issued an apology for a highly offensive act in their opening ceremony that used drag queens to parody the Last Supper. The segment, which appeared to mimic Leonardo da Vinci’s famous depiction of the last supper, featured a number of drag queens, along with a transgender model and a nude singer who wore makeup that called to mind the Greek god of wine, Dionysus. Held on the Seine River in France, the opening ceremony attracted millions of viewers from around the world, and while there were numerous gaffes, such as the South Korean team of athletes being introduced as North Koreans, the drag queen controversy has been dominating the conversation. The event immediately drew criticism from the Conference of French Bishops, who said in a statement: “This ceremony has unfortunately included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity, which we very deeply deplore.” U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called out the act on social media, writing: “Last night’s mockery of the Last Supper was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world who watched the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.” At least one company has withdrawn its support for the games , with tech firm C Spire announcing it will be pulling its Olympic advertising in response to the controversial act. The Olympics have been accused of trying to curb criticism of the ceremony via a censorship campaign, with numerous social media users who posted videos or screenshots of the controversial scene being hit with Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) complaints, which can lead to account suspensions . Officials are trying to convince the public they had no idea people would be offended Officials finally issued a half-hearted apology in response to the outrage. A spokeswoman for Paris 2024 stated: ""There was never an intention to show disrespect to a religious group. If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really sorry."" It’s hard to believe that it never occurred to them that deriding the religious beliefs of billions of people around the world on a global stage wouldn’t go over well. After recreating a famous scene in the Bible involving Jesus’s final dinner with his apostles before being crucified using drag queens and a transgender model, what kind of response did they think they would get? A spokesperson for the Holy See, Bishop Emmanuel Gobillard, told NBC News : “The fact that our religion should be mocked is usual and we are used to blasphemy in France, but the context isn’t the same. In an event that brings together all or part of the population, I found this staging hurtful and out of place.” Artistic director Thomas Jolly made a laughable statement, telling the media that it was really about diversity and inclusion. “ We wanted to talk about diversity . Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that,” he said, with the world’s 2.4 billion Christians apparently not falling under his definition of “everyone.” Imagine the response they would have received if they had instead tried to mock something related to Islamic beliefs. Considering how much time and money is put into planning the Olympics many years in advance, no one is buying their claim that it never occurred to anyone involved that this would somehow be upsetting to a significant number of people. It was surely rehearsed multiple times in the presence of Olympic officials. They knew, but they apparently didn’t care. Aren’t the Olympics supposed to be about sports? "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-29-ed-dowd-four-year-recap-hell-covid.html,Ed Dowd releases four-year recap of earthly NIGHTMARE since COVID,"The industrious former Wall Street guru Ed Dowd has recapped the past four years of life on earth , a time in history that was certainly not for the faint of heart. After the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic"" was unleashed in early 2020, the Trump administration locked down the nation, which bankrupted many small businesses while fueling the massive growth of corporate control. While everyone was stuck at home staying ""safe,"" the George Floyd false flag was executed, bringing with it ""peaceful riots"" that caused billions of dollars in property damage. All that property damage, by the way, has contributed to the downfall of the insurance industry. Some carriers have disappeared while others have raised their rates substantially – you have Black Lives Matter (BLM) and the group's handlers to thank for that. A few years go by with forced ""stay at home"" measures, mask mandates and other horrors that only started to let up after the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed to mass-inject the planet as quickly as possible. It was around this time that we learned about hospital COVID protocols that incentivized the murder of millions of people. And let us not forget the freak show known as 2020 election, which was stolen in broad daylight at the height of COVID. There was a Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol right before Joe Biden's inauguration that resulted in ""insurrection"" charges against a number of Trump supporters, some of whom are still imprisoned without charges. (Related: Last fall, Dowd issued a warning about how a ""slow Mad Max"" scenario is unfolding as America teeters on the brink of collapse.) Here comes the financial collapse As all of this is going on, the financial markets are going haywire as ""meme"" stocks explode in price and the markets teeter back and forth with wild volatility. There was the infamous COVID stock market crash followed by the stimulus checks, which were followed by massive, money printing-induced inflation. Housing prices across America have only continued to explode while wages stagnate, and the Federal Reserve is attempting to keep the scam going by raising interest rates and pumping the markets to new all-time heights. Early 2022 brought Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the never-ending war that continues to this day. Bank failures followed in spring of 2023, prompting a Fed bailout that expired this past March. Then, last fall brought the Hamas attack on Israel and the nine month-plus war by Israel in Gaza. That war is still raging with new threats from Hezbollah in the north, as well as the big boy, Iran, which is always on the verge of producing nuclear weapons. The government continues to juice the economy with reckless deficit spending and government hires coupled with fraudulent payroll numbers starting last fall around the time of the Hamas attack. Now that the 18-month lag period has expired, the nation is also seeing much worse economic impacts from the Fed rate hikes. Campus protests also erupted this year against Israel's war, and at the very same time the criminal justice system has been trying every which way to get rid of Trump, including, apparently by trying to kill him in Butler, Penn. Now the country faces at least a six-month Kamala Harris presidency, assuming Biden steps down now, followed by either another Trump term or four additional years of Kackling Kamala ruling America. ""The heroic intervention by the administration and Fed has run its course and was a dead cat bounce,"" Dowd said about the Fed's bank bailouts. ""So throw in a likely recession into the mix in next 3-6 months. They avoided one in second half of 23 but the intervention will likely make this worse.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-29-harley-davidson-boycott-over-dei-pride-events.html,Harley-Davidson facing BOYCOTT over DEI Pride events FOR KIDS,"Iconic motorcycle brand Harley-Davidson is facing criticism from conservative groups for its promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, including supporting Pride events that target children . The company, which generates $6 billion annually and is known for its tough, rebellious image, is under fire after critics highlighted its DEI initiatives and urged riders to boycott the brand. Robby Starbuck, an online influencer, has been very vocal about exposing Harley-Davidson's support for various progressive causes, including policies on transgender care for children, critical race theory and prioritizing minority groups in business. This backlash is similar to those faced by other companies, like John Deere and Bud Light, which have been criticized for their support of LGBTQ+ and other progressive causes which harm consumers and turn them away. (Related: John Deere abandons WOKE DEI corporate policies following backlash from conservative activists .) Supporters of DEI initiatives argue that they help increase the representation of women and ethnic, sexual and gender minorities in the workplace. However, critics view these efforts as ""tokenistic"" and believe they disproportionately impact straight White men. Starbuck, a former House candidate for the Republican primary in Tennessee, expressed his concern, stating that Harley-Davidson seems to have lost touch with its core customer base. He cited several examples of the company's actions , such as supporting the Democrat-sponsored Equality Act, funding Pride events and requiring employees to undergo LGBTQ+ ally training, among others. According to Starbuck, Harley-Davidson's CEO Jochen Zeitz has pushed the company towards a more progressive stance, including a commitment to DEI policies. These efforts have included forming partnerships with organizations like the Wisconsin LGBT Chamber of Commerce and the Human Rights Campaign and supporting initiatives like the ""United for Equity"" program by United Way. The company has also introduced employee resource groups that focus on gender, race and sexual identity. Starbuck encouraged conservative customers to voice their concerns and consider whether Harley-Davidson's values align with their own. He suggested that consumers use their purchasing power to support companies that reflect their values and avoid those that promote ideologies they disagree with. Harley-Davidson has been a symbol of freedom and rebellion for over a century. Known for its iconic motorcycles and the culture of independence it represents, the brand has attracted a diverse group of riders who value the open road and the sense of adventure that comes with it. Many customers alienated by Harley-Davidson's new direction There are mixed reactions to Harley-Davidson's actions. While some people support the company's efforts to be more inclusive and diverse, others feel alienated. Social media has played a significant role in spreading both support and criticism, showing how public opinion is divided on this issue. Harley-Davidson has not publicly responded to criticisms but the controversy reflects a broader trend of conservative-led boycotts against brands that support progressive policies. While some customers may find Harley-Davidson's DEI efforts uncontroversial, others feel alienated by the company's direction, The situation highlights the challenges companies face in navigating social and political issues in today's divided climate. As Harley-Davidson navigates this controversy, questions remain about how it will balance its traditional image with new social responsibilities. The company is at a crossroads – trying to reconcile differing viewpoints among its customer base. Customers are encouraged to express their opinions respectfully, as their feedback is crucial in shaping the company's future direction. Head over to Wokies.news for similar stories.

Hotez, who works at Texas Children's Hospital, was asked in a recent interview – watch a portion of it below – about how ""anti-vaccine aggression"" should be handled by the so-called authorities. ""Fortunately, I have to give you a very long I don't know the answer to your question answer because it is very complicated,"" Hotez said.

Who, then, does Hotez believe needs to be pulled in to help the health sector solve the ""anti-vaccine aggression"" problem? All the big guns in Washington, D.C., was his answer. ""We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, the Justice Department to help us understand how to do this,"" Hotez explained.

""We need the other United Nations agencies: NATO,"" Hotez continued. ""This is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two-hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression."" It is not simply a matter of health freedom for Americans to have a choice over whether or not to take a government-imposed vaccine. Hotez feels as though nobody should have a choice, and that those who believe they do have a choice should be dealt with like enemy combatants. ""And so, this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as, it's just as, though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives, the other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression,"" Hotez bumbled in trying to make his point. Simply put, Hotez believes that the federal government and even international bodies like NATO should intervene to put an end to everyone who opposes vaccines and vaccine ""science,"" which just so happens to be Hotez's career bread and butter. ""This 'doctor' may as well be Mengele's sidekick,"" wrote someone on X about how Hotez seems to closely resemble Adolph Hitler's most prominent experimental physician. ""A person of influence who deserves NONE,"" said another about Hotez. ""Why do people listen to this man, and why do they allow themselves to be influenced by his words?""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-29-man-suffers-debilitation-death-after-pfizer-shot.html,Young man suffers month-long debilitation and death after taking Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine,"A 23-year-old college student from Nashville, Tennessee suffered an agonizing death after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. His parents, Andy Lieffring and Kimberly Aveyah have decided to speak out . Their full story is published at Children's Health Defense ""The People's Study."" Trent Lieffring, a promising young student with a bright future, received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in 2022, as recommended by his biology professor. His professor claimed that getting the vaccine is a civic responsibility. Despite his family's reservations and their own concerns about the rapid development of the vaccine, and despite the shots being completely unnecessary, Trent chose to get the two doses anyway, spaced two and half months apart. Young man suffers blood clots, cardiac arrest, brain damage that put him in a vegetative state Initially, Trent appeared to be in good health. However, about eight to nine months after the initial dose, he suffered a cardiac arrest caused by the sudden development of blood clots. The medical event led to brain damage and severe debilitation that could not be remedied by doctors. His condition rapidly deteriorated, resulting in him spending the remainder of his life in a vegetative state before passing away on August 24, 2023. In an emotional interview with CHD.TV’s “The People’s Study,” Trent’s parents detailed the tragic sequence of events. “Trent didn’t need it, but he took that speech [from his biology professor] to heart and went and got the vaccine,” Kimberly said. Afterward, the Lieffring family described a sudden and shocking decline in Trent’s health. According to Trent’s girlfriend, one night Trent came home with a high fever and serious agitation. By the next morning, he had passed out. When Trent went into cardiac arrest, paramedics were able to revive him, but not before significant brain damage occurred due to a lack of oxygen. Despite extensive testing, doctors were unable to definitively determine the cause of his sudden health crisis, though blood clots were found in his leg. When his parent’s arrived to the hospital, their previously health son was on a ventilator, with “tubes everywhere” and “his head wrapped up,” Kimberly recalled. Andy and Kimberly criticized the medical community for initially failing to acknowledge any link between Trent’s condition and the COVID-19 vaccine. “Anytime we brought up vaccination, COVID… everybody just kind of shut up,” Andy noted. Doctors focused on treating Trent’s symptoms without addressing the vaccine connection . Trent spent nearly a month in the hospital before being transferred to a state-run nursing home due to his uninsured status. Despite the challenging conditions, his family remained by his side, advocating for better care. Later, when Medicaid coverage was approved, Trent was able to return to the hospital and then spend his final months at home, receiving physical and speech therapy. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine recognized as cause of death on Trent's death certificate In his final days, Trent was placed under hospice care. His family struggled with the decision, but didn’t have many options as his gallbladder shut down. “He could respond to pain and sounds and things like that that are coming from your brain stem, those basic functions,” Kimberly said. “But it’s hard to say if someone in the vegetative state is aware of you or not. Sometimes we thought he was. And then as things progressed … I didn’t feel like he knew we were there.” He rapidly declined from there, as he faded away over the next nine days. After he had passed, the family was surprised to see the COVID-19 vaccine as a contributing factor on Trent’s death certificate. They believe that the hospice nurses, having witnessed similar cases, decided to list it as a cause of death based on their observations. The death certificate specifically read ""anoxic brain injury due to cardiopulmonary arrest with resuscitation due to COVID vaccination reaction."" Vaccine side effects are not rare when they happen to your own family. They become a very real experience of trauma and grief. With eleven months since Trent’s passing, his father said, ""There’s not a single day … where it doesn’t hit you like a ton of bricks. Sometimes, you feel like your heart’s going to explode. He would have been a fantastic father."" As medical communities start to acknowledge vaccine side effects and deaths, there is a cold realization that the vaccine industry is getting away with murder. As of July 2024, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters remain on the market in the United States. The jab is still included on the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule, despite links to epilepsy, myocarditis, severe allergic shock, appendicitis and death . State health department databases continue to include vaccination status for the COVID-19 vaccine in their databases, recommending that children continue to receive them.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-29-pediatrician-endorsing-puberty-blockers-serving-biden-admin.html,Former chief pediatrician at Texas Children’s Hospital who endorsed puberty blockers for minors now serves in the Biden administration,"America First Legal (AFL) recently revealed that the former chief pediatrician of Texas Children's Hospital who endorsed puberty blockers for minors has assumed a high-ranking office at the National Institute of Health (NIH) following her resignation from the hospital in April 2022. In 2022, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas ordered an investigation into underage transitions, directing state officials to treat such procedures as child abuse. This directive led Texas Children's Hospital to halt its gender transition services for minors. Catherine Gordon, the chief pediatrician of the hospital at the time, resigned after an article she authored supporting puberty blockers as ""invaluable"" for gender-confused minors came under scrutiny. She then joined the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as clinical director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) on September 2023 . According to the emails obtained by AFL, Gordon began communicating with HHS Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine shortly after she resigned from Texas Children's Hospital. Levine, a vocal advocate for transitioning minors, played a significant role in Gordon's appointment to her current position at NICHD, which occurred approximately a month after their initial communications. (Related: Biden health official pressured transgender health organization to remove age limit for trans surgeries .) AFL also revealed that Gordon's official biography on the NIH website omits her tenure at Texas Children’s Hospital. Instead, it highlights her ""training in both adolescent medicine and pediatric endocrinology with research experience in adolescent bone health, including identifying modifiable factors during adolescence that influence bone density and other aspects of health during the adult years."" Her emphasis on bone development is notable, given her October 2021 article advocating for puberty blockers for children as ""lifesaving"" interventions, despite acknowledging the need for more research on this controversial process. She consistently argued that the potential negative effects of puberty blockers on bone density must be weighed against claims that lack of access to such treatments could lead to higher suicide rates among transgender children. AFL adviser condemns Gordon and her role in the Biden administration Ian Prior, a senior adviser at AFL, condemned Gordon's role in the Biden administration. ""While the rest of the world is pulling back on the inhumane practice of child experimentation, the Biden administration is plowing full steam ahead, and the Department of Health and Human Services is leading the way,"" said Prior. ""Whether it's putting transgender-activist doctors in high-ranking positions in the National Institute of Health or prosecuting doctors who blow the whistle on these barbaric medical treatments, the Biden administration is weaponizing the federal government to destroy any dissent or challenge to child mutilation and sterilization,"" he added. ""America First Legal is committed to ending these practices and ensuring that history remembers those who perpetrated these crimes against humanity.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-29-pediatrician-warns-against-plan-inject-500m-children.html,Pediatrician warns against plan by Gates-backed entity to INJECT 500M children,"A prominent children's doctor has warned against a plan by an entity backed by Microsoft co-founder and technocrat Bill Gates to vaccinate half a billion children by 2030 . Pediatrician Dr. Paul Thomas warned against the efforts of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The Gates Foundation reportedly allocated $11.9 billion to GAVI for its plan to vaccinate 500 million children by 2030. But for Thomas, the plan to inject 500 million children with deadly vaccines is both dangerous and unnecessary. Instead, the pediatrician advocates for a focus on nutrition and overall health. GAVI justified its plan by citing a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) published on July 15. According to this report, global childhood immunization rates have stalled, with 84 percent of children being vaccinated in 2023. Despite efforts by global health authorities, this number has not improved. The report also highlighted the reduction in missed doses of so-called ""routine"" diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccines last year, with 13.9 million fewer children receiving all doses in 2022 It also revealed gaps in measles vaccination, which it blamed for outbreaks of the disease that hit 103 countries. This stagnation, the report noted, highlights ongoing challenges in the wake of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – including poor access to health services and fragile, conflict-ridden areas. Given this, GAVI's plan seeks to inject 500 million children with existing and new vaccines by 2030, claiming that doing so will prevent up to nine million deaths. The Geneva, Switzerland-based GAVI is now seeking $9 billion in new pledges of the $11.9 billion needed for the project, according to the Daily Expose . (Related: GAVI Vaccine Alliance: The source of terror behind global lockdowns and vaccine coercion. ) Thomas: Vaccine uptake is ALL ABOUT MONEY, not health But Thomas noted that vaccination programs such as the one GAVI wants to launch are unnecessary. He argued that success should be measured on the overall health of the population, not vaccination rates. ""The less we vaccinate, the healthier the population,"" remarked Thomas, who also authored a study comparing the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children and others. His warning highlights the potential risks and unintended consequences of mass vaccination efforts , the Expose pointed out. In a separate interview with the Defender , the pediatrician warned that global vaccination programs continue to use the whole-cell DTP formulation instead of the less risky acellular version. The whole-cell vaccine, which contains the entire Bordetella pertussis organism, has resulted in widespread reports of neurological damage since the 1930s. While it was phased out in the U.S. by 1997, the whole-cell formulation has seen continued use in low- and middle-income countries, putting the lives of millions of children at risk. ""Measles outbreaks are the canary in the coal mine, exposing and exploiting gaps in immunization and hitting the most vulnerable first,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. However, Thomas disagreed with the global health body's stance on measles. According to the pediatrician, measles is not a threat to well-nourished, healthy children and focusing on vaccines as a solution ""is destroying the immune systems"" of those who are highly vaccinated. He continued: ""The focus should be on making sure children of the world have adequate nutrition and adequate support of vitamins A, D and C."" The WHO and UNICEF report also noted ""progress"" in some areas of global immunization, including the uptake of the HPV vaccine. Thomas dubbed the HPV injection ""the most dangerous vaccine on the planet other than COVID-19,"" and argued that it ""should have been removed from the market."" ""The push to increase vaccine uptake is all about money,"" the pediatrician remarked, adding that GAVI and others involved in financing and increasing vaccine distribution are ""a big part of the problem."" Thomas ultimately called for ""a total paradigm shift,"" explaining: ""Imagine the health and freedom and happiness that could be enjoyed worldwide if we focused on healthy nutrition, and assessed health by looking at all health outcomes when we do an intervention.""

""Bullying,"" in this context, means excluding biological males from the all-female race even though they are not females but simply identify as such within the specially protected LGBTQ+ classification system for sexual deviancy. According to reports, the Jerry Baker Memorial Velodrome has been hosting controversial sports events for years that allow ""transwomen"" to participate in all sorts of female sports based on their self-chosen ""gender identities."" At the recent Grand Prix, at least three men were present in the female category during the women's Madison race, a high-speed, two-person relay race. The race involves one partner from each team starting while the ""resting"" partner pedals slowly along the top of the track. ""Partners exchange positions by pulling even with each other and then relaying or 'slinging' the incoming partner into the race,"" reported En-Volve.com about how the race works. (Related: Many female athletes are speaking out against the ""transwomen"" takeover of their sports but nobody seems to care.) UCI governing body for cycling banned transgender athletes in 2023 The three men who participated in the Madison race as ""transwomen"" and won include: 1) ""Jenna"" Lingwood, born as James, the women's masters 40+ national cyclocross champion who placed first 2) Jordan Lothrop, a cyclist from Canada who had been racing with men as recently as 2023, who placed second 3) Eva Lin, born as Henry, who used to race for San Jose State University's (SJSU) men's team, who placed third ""Teams that had one male and one female went 1-2-3 in the women's Madison at the Marymoor Grand Prix,"" wrote a women's rights advocate on X in jest about the ""victories."" ""I wonder what gave those teams an edge over the 100% female teams?"" Note that in July of 2023, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world governing body for cycling, banned all transgender athletes from participating in any of their events that have already gone through male puberty. UCI's previous barriers, which included testosterone level restrictions, were deemed as not ""sufficient to completely eliminate the benefits of testosterone during puberty in men,"" according to a statement from the group. ""Given the current state of scientific knowledge, it is also impossible to rule out the possibility that biomechanical factors such as the shape and arrangement of the bones in their limbs may constitute a lasting advantage for female transgender athletes,"" UCI further said. UCI president David Lappartient added that his governing body has a ""duty to guarantee, above all, equal opportunities"" for all cycling competitors, which means keeping men out of women's races. ""It is this imperative that led the UCI to conclude that, given the current state of scientific knowledge does not guarantee such equality of opportunity between transgender female athletes and cisgender female participants, it was not possible, as a precautionary measure, to authorize the former to race in the female categories,"" Lappartient said. Two months prior to UCI's decision to ban transgender athletes, British Cycling introduced its own new policy creating a third ""open"" category of cycling in which people of any gender identity and sex are allow to compete. ""The female category would be restricted only to biological women, including those who identified as transgender, but who had yet to undertake hormone therapy,"" reports explain. ""However, as noted by the Independent Council on Women's Sports, USA Cycling has not adopted these new, stricter policies that prevent biological males from competing with and beating women and girls.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-28-elon-musk-woke-virus-son-gender-confusion.html,Elon Musk blames “woke virus” for his son’s gender confusion,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has blamed the ""woke virus"" for the gender confusion that befell his son Xavier. The X owner denounced this ""woke virus"" in the form of ""gender-affirming care"" – medical sterilization – during a recent conversation with clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson. According to Musk, he was pressured into approving puberty blockers for his son after being threatened with the possibility of Xavier taking his own life. This eventually led to Xavier's distress and eventual estrangement with him. The South African-born technocrat was reportedly ""misled"" about the effects of these treatments. He subsequently described Xavier's ""transition"" and use of the new name Vivian Jenna Wilson as a result of being infected with this ""woke mind virus."" This experience has only intensified Musk's resolve to challenge the harmful gender ideology. (Related: Musk slams expensive California school for infecting his transgender son with ""woke mind virus."" ) ""It happened to one of my older boys, where I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier. This is before I had any understanding of what was going on. [The Wuhan coronavirus] COVID-19 was going on, so there was a lot of confusion and I was told Xavier might commit suicide if he doesn't [receive puberty blockers],"" Musk recounted to Peterson on July 22. Peterson replied that the suicide threat ""was a lie from the beginning,"" something Musk agreed with. ""Incredibly evil, and I agree with you that people that have been promoting this should go to prison,"" the X owner continued. ""It wasn't explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs."" ""I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus."" Musk's ""dead son"" pushes back against father's comments In 2022, Xavier petitioned a California court to change his name and gender, arguing that he no longer wishes to be related to Musk ""in any way, shape or form"" – which was granted. He later took to social media following his father's comments. Xavier pointed out on July 25 that he is ""legally recognized as a woman in the state of California,"" and ""does not concern [himself] with the opinions of those who are below me."" He also urged Elon to ""touch some grass."" Great Game India mentioned: ""The suicide threat is often raised by professionals who suggest gender-neutral therapy. In an attempt to get parents to comply, they frequently pose a troubling question, usually framed as: 'Would you rather have a dead son or a living daughter?' But criticism of the presumed connection between gender dysphoria and suicide has surfaced, and not just from the general public."" The outlet referenced a Finnish study published in January, which concluded that ""gender dysphoria per se does not seem to predict either all-cause [or] suicide mortality in gender-referred adolescents."" It continued that the ""main predictor of mortality in this population is psychiatric morbidity. Medical gender reassignment does not have an impact on suicide risk."" Last year, Musk said his separation from Xavier was perhaps more heartbreaking than when his first son passed away at a young age. Xavier is the eldest of five children – a pair of twins and a set of triplets – the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has with Canadian author Justine Wilson. Musk's experience strengthened his determination to get rid of the leftist ideology. ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that,"" he told Peterson. In line with this, Musk has promised to donate $45 million to a super-political action committee that supports former President Donald Trump and concentrates on ""get out the vote"" campaigns – putting his money where his mouth is.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-26-microplastics-linked-heart-attack-stroke-early-death.html,"Microplastics linked to higher risk of heart attack, stroke and early death","Doctors have warned of potentially life-threatening effects of plastic pollution after finding a substantially elevated risk of stroke, heart attack and early death in people whose blood vessels were contaminated with microplastics. Researchers in Naples examined fatty plaques removed from the blood vessels of patients with arterial disease and found that more than half had deposits contaminated with tiny particles of polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). (Related: Microplastics pick up pollution, making them even more toxic to humans .) Those whose plaques contained microplastics were nearly five times more likely to suffer a stroke, heart attack or death from any cause over the following 34 months, compared with those whose plaques were free from plastic contamination. ""Our data will dramatically impact cardiovascular health if confirmed because we are defenseless against plastic pollution,"" said Dr. Raffaele Marfella, first author of the study. ""The only defense we have available today is prevention by reducing plastic production."" A new study published in eBioMedicine has also uncovered a troubling link between microplastics in blood clots and serious health issues, including strokes and heart attacks. Researchers examined blood clots from patients who had experienced strokes, deep vein thrombosis or heart attacks. Using advanced spectrometry techniques, they found that 80 percent of the analyzed blood clots contained microplastics. Results of the study also suggest a correlation between higher concentrations of microplastics and an increased risk of thrombotic events and more severe health outcomes. Microplastics consisting of polymers with surprisingly diverse physical characteristics were found in varying concentrations within the thrombi of veins and arteries. A small amount of microplastics within thrombi might not be problematic, but their accumulation is linked to ischemic strokes. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming around 700,000 lives a year, based on the most recent statistics. Research also shows that a common condition can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke – often without any clear symptoms. Microplastics are everywhere Plastic doesn't decompose in the way food and paper do. Instead, it breaks down into tiny pieces that enter into our systems and become what's known as microplastic. Microplastics aren't just a problem for human bodies. These tiny particles have been found in marine animals, and consequently pose risks to humans who consume seafood. They also accumulate in agricultural soils, potentially affecting crop growth and soil health. The use of plastic mulch in farming and the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer are just some of the ways microplastics contaminate agricultural soils. Microplastics can also be inhaled, and in high concentrations these can cause breathing problems and respiratory issues. Scientists are now calling for more comprehensive studies to better understand the long-term health effects of microplastic exposure. Policymakers are developing effective strategies to reduce pollution, with several countries banning single-use plastics and implementing stricter regulations on plastic production and disposal.

The American Medical Association (AMA) made a few changes this past week to its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) system, described as ""the leading medical terminology code set for describing health care procedures and services."" One change is the creation of a new CPT code for H5N8 Influenza virus ""vaccine"" candidates that ""receive emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."" You may recall that during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic,"" the FDA granted EUA to the lineup of injections unleashed through Operation Warp Speed. Now, for the first time since COVID, the medical establishment is readying itself for what appears to be the next scamdemic : bird flu . To ensure that health care systems across the United States are up to date with the codes in their electronic systems, the AMA is updating its CPT system right away ""in advance for the potential FDA authorization,"" which appears imminent. ""The new CPT code is a vital preparatory step in response to the potential danger to humans from a highly infectious avian influenza disease,"" commented AMA President Dr. Bruce A. Scott, M.D. ""A CPT code that clinically distinguishes the avian influenza vaccine allows for data-driven tracking, reporting, and analysis that supports planning, preparedness, and allocation of vaccines in case a public health response is needed for avian flu prevention."" (Related: Did you know that the COVID jabs the FDA granted EUA to under Trump's watch are triggering a once-rare facial paralysis disease in some recipients?)

""I expect the next pandemic after Donald Trump gets back into office unless he finds a way to shut it down,"" Renz wrote. ""That said – can you imagine another plandemic with a Kamala Harris president? No way."" OAMF noted that the AMA's CPT codes cover both adults and children who will be expected to take not just a ""first"" bird flu shot but also ""each additional vaccine,"" this referring to so-called boosters.

""This is just further confirmation that the next control pandemic is in route,"" OAMF said. ""We're all focused on the election, but we need to pay attention to what they're doing in the dark!"" Renz also had a few things to say to Elon Musk and the other controllers of X concerning the apparent censorship still taking place on the social media platform. ""Why is it that the pics on this threat keep being hidden and the thread does not appear in any searches for mRNA or elsewhere?"" Renz asked after observing what he believed to be shadow-banning and other censorship actions occurring on his thread about all this. ""Obviously it is being discussed and trending but – much like many other items on my feed – the pics are continually suppressed and the post cannot be found in a search.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-26-biden-emerges-with-hallmark-signs-suffered-stroke.html,STROKE? Resident Biden finally emerges from his dark hole with hallmark signs he may have suffered a STROKE,"On July 23 rd , 2024, Dementia Joe crawled out of his Delaware cave and hobbled toward Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base, showing all signs he has just suffered a stroke and can barely function at all. Was it all just a “deep fake” or a “cheap fake?” Take a good look at how he’s holding his left hand, where the fingers are unnaturally curled inward, and can barely even grasp his Covid face diaper. Covid is likely just a cover story for Biden recovering from a stroke recently, most likely from the stress of his abysmal debate performance . When a stroke occurs, the hands often experience increased stiffness and clench, due to disrupted neural connections between the brain and the hand muscles . This effect is known as severe spasticity, and it makes it very difficult for the victim to fully straighten the fingers or grasp an item, even something as simple to hold as a Fauci Flu mouth-covering bacteria breeder. It only goes straight downhill from here for Dementia Joe It’s quite typical for a stroke victim to experience numbness on one side of the body, while the other side remains fully functional. If you notice during Biden’s speeches, he talks mainly out of the right side of his mouth, barely moving the left side. In fact, when he smiles (that sinister, fake smile), only the right side of his mouth pulls back to show teeth, while the left side holds firm. Resident Biden has been holding his hands peculiarly stiff for some time now also, as he walks around like a robot, like C3PO from Star Wars. When his mind is attached to something else (like children nearby or trying to remember who he is or where he is), his hands are straight, stiff and pointing down. He has no idea , so then when his handlers yell into his earpiece, he adjusts, plays with his sunglasses or does a quick little fake cough, just to create some action and distract from the world noticing. In the pictures below, you’ll notice his thumb is bent inward, but is not holding anything. Not many people do that with their thumb for no reason (he might think it’s helping hold the face diaper, because it’s numb and he can’t feel it). Also notice he’s not really grasping the mask; it’s just lodged between two fingers slightly. All this while his handlers tell him to give a thumbs up, like he’s just fine to run the country, have direct access to the nuclear codes, and promote more communism with a new puppet leader. Resident Biden also appears to have passed out and fallen during that presumable stroke and banged his face on the floor or against some furniture, as we see severe bruising on the left side of his jaw and chin , as photographed during his recently televised national address about his failures and incompetencies. Serious cognitive decline in full gear now for Dementia Joe, as he likely enters stage 4 or even 5 of Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s If you are thinking our nation’s problems can’t get any worse, think again. Both the President and Vice President have cognitive issues , but Biden’s are spiraling out of control. Plus, cognitive problems are often worse during the first few months following a stroke, where cerebral infarction and brain hemorrhage are the most common causes of memory loss. Two-thirds of stroke patients suffer cognitive impairment and decline right after the stroke, with one third developing dementia. At this juncture, Biden might actually believe he is STILL in charge and running for another term. The “call in” to congratulate Obamala Harris (Yes, Obama is running for his 4 th term) could have easily been a deep fake AI version of Biden’s voice. If you read about ten pages of information to any AI system, the AI system can pretty much say anything after that and it will sound exactly like the real person said it, even all new words. In fact, “Shadow of Ezra” put Biden’s AI phone call to Obamala Harris and the AI system shows a 98% likelihood it WAS AI and not the real Biden speaking. Biden may also be suffering from vascular dementia , from the Covid clot shots he got. Even though Biden got 4 shots, he still supposedly got Covid 3 times. Go figure. Here’s the real dilemma. The mRNA jabs cause vascular clots, so Biden may be suffering from what’s known as vascular dementia . Early symptoms of vascular dementia include problems with planning, organizing, making decisions and solving problems. Perfect for the leader of the free world, who still has 6 months to serve.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-alberta-premier-pledges-amend-bill-of-rights.html,Alberta premier pledges to amend Bill of Rights to include HEALTH FREEDOM,"Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, Canada, has pledged to amend the province's Bill of Rights to include health freedom and the right to refuse vaccines. According to InfoWars , her promise to add protections for personal choice on vaccinations came because of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates put in place for a time in Alberta under its former Premier Jason Kenney. The incumbent premier told Albertans at a recent town hall in Bonnyville that the COVID-19 crisis resulted in many people being discriminated against for their own medical decisions – something that ""shouldn't have happened."" Smith added that she believes ""every person has to be able to do their own assessment, their own health assessment, to be able to make those decisions."" Smith originally planned to add protections for one's vaccine status directly under the Alberta Human Rights Act. However, she scrapped this plan following advice by Preston Manning, the chairman of the Public Health Emergencies Government Review Panel. According to Manning, this was not the right legislation for an additional protection. (Related: Trudeau's COVID-19 vaccine mandate violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedom, says charter signatory .) Because of this, the premier promised that a better law dealing directly with vaccine status will be forthcoming. She confirmed in a post on X that an updated version of the Bill of Rights is coming. ""It's time. Let's get this done,"" Smith wrote on July 22. Last year, LifeSiteNews reported Smith's promises to enshrine protections for people in Alberta who choose not to be vaccinated, strengthen gun rights and safeguard free speech – by means of amending the province's Bill of Rights. ""You have my commitment,"" she told Alberta blogger Shaun Newman. ""No one's going to be forced to be vaccinated."" Smith's pro-health freedom stance a complete 180 from Kenney's Smith took over from Kenney as leader of the United Conservative Party (UCP) on Oct 11, 2022 after winning the party leadership. The UCP then won the province's general election in May 2023. Kenney was ousted due to low approval ratings and for reneging on promises not to lock Alberta down during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his term as premier, thousands of nurses, doctors and other healthcare and government workers lost their jobs for refusing to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. On Smith's first day on the job, and mere minutes after getting sworn in as premier, she remarked that the ""unvaccinated"" were the group of people ""most discriminated against"" in her lifetime during the COVID-19 years. Smith also promptly fired former Alberta Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw and the entire board of directors of the Alberta Health Services (AHS). Hinshaw and the whole AHS board oversaw the implementation of COVID-19 vaccine mandates, according to InfoWars . ""While Smith has not said much regarding the COVID-19 shots since taking office, she has allowed her caucus members to have broad views when it comes to known safety issues related to the jabs,"" the independent outlet added. One such member is Eric Bouchard, a Member of the Alberta Legislative Assembly under the UCP. Bouchard hosted a sold-out event in June titled ""An Injection of Truth"" that featured prominent doctors and experts speaking out against COVID-19 vaccines and mandates. The event's speakers included Dr. Byram Bridle, Dr. William Makis, pediatric neurologist Dr. Eric Payne and Mark Trozzi, a victim of the medical police state.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-rare-facial-paralysis-disease-surges-covid-jabs.html,Once-rare facial paralysis disease surges due to COVID jabs,"A team of physician investigators from Adventist Health, a faith-based, nonprofit, integrated health system serving more than 90 communities on the West Coast and Hawaii with more than 400 locations, has discovered that cases of oculomotor nerve palsy, a once-rare form of facial paralysis, is on the rise due to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines."" Drs. Antonio K. Liu, M.D., and Ifeanyichukwu Ozobu, M.D., led the team at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles in identifying the trigger behind soaring rates of oculomotor nerve palsy, also known as third nerve palsy. ""Oculomotor nerve palsy is derived from damage to the third cranial nerve,"" writes Frank Bergman for Slay News . ""The condition causes characteristic symptoms, such as a drooping eyelid, double vision, pupil dilation, and deficits in adduction and vertical gaze."" (Related: Remember when Justin Bieber canceled his entire 2023 world tour after developing facial paralysis post-COVID ""vaccination?"") Skip the shots, avoid facial paralysis The team analyzed recent cases of the strange facial paralysis condition in conjunction with patients' ""vaccination"" status for COVID. They took particular note of the relation between mRNA (modRNA) injections and third nerve palsy. From there, they divided the patients they analyzed into two groups based on when their symptoms appeared: the immediate group and the delayed group as some of the patients became paralyzed right away while others experienced disease later. The two types of mRNA injections offered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are linked both to immediate onset oculomotor nerve palsy as well as the delayed form of the disease. In one patient case, a person who took Moderna's ""Spikevax"" (mRNA-1273) injection developed third nerve palsy 14 days after getting the shot. That case dovetailed with another involving a patient who developed the disease 17 days after injection. Interestingly, the team discovered positive ganglioside antibodies in the patients, meaning autoantibodies that are produced against gangliosides, as glycosphingolipids contain sialic acid. The team warns that these findings ""highlight the potential for unusual occurrences following COVID-19 vaccination but also opens up avenues for exploring the underlying mechanisms behind these events."" The fact that such research took place under the umbrella of a major West Coast health group is both unexpected and encouraging in that it demonstrates a growing interest even among establishment doctors to pinpoint why ""fully vaccinated"" people are getting critically ill with all sorts of new diseases. In another case highlighted by the research, an 81-year-old man had to be rushed to the emergency room after developing diplopia, also known as double vision, due to his COVID shots. Before getting injected and sick, the man had no previously confirmed infection with COVID. This individual received a Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA booster shot just 16 days before he presented with double vision. The onset of his symptoms occurred two weeks after getting jabbed. During the injection process, the man reported only mild malaise with all of his ""past medical history, family history, and social history ... all non-contributory."" ""His pupils were both reactive to light,"" the man's doctors reported. ""On digital pupillometry, his pupils showed slightly different sizes (right: 3.22 mm, left: 3.45 mm) and demonstrated decreased reactivity in the right eye (Neurological Pupillary Index: right 2.2, left 2.7)."" The man's doctors concluded that their ""findings were consistent with an isolated right oculomotor nerve palsy that spared the pupil."" It took several days for the man's doctors to figure out that he had developed oculomotor nerve palsy, which in his case eventually resolved itself. The research team speculates that perhaps the underlying mechanism behind all this is molecular mimicry, an autoimmune mechanism in which the immune system mistakes the body's own tissue as a foreign invader. It is never a good idea to get injected for COVID. Learn more at ChemicalViolence.com . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-mainstream-media-big-pharma-promote-weight-loss-injections.html,The mainstream media is helping Big Pharma promote high-profit weight loss injections,"The mainstream media has long been used to advertise for and support the pharmaceutical industry, and anyone who has ever doubted this is the case was proven wrong by the way the media handled COVID-19 vaccines. Now, the “solution” they’re pushing on the masses is the weight loss drug Ozempic and others of its ilk, and much like the vaccines, they’re doing their best to gloss over the dangerous side effects. Multiple mainstream media outlets have been doing segments on Ozempic, not only touting the injectable diabetes drug’s weight loss benefits but also pointing to other supposed benefits, like a clip on NBC that claimed it can reduce the risk of cancer. What they’re not talking about nearly as much are the scary side effects of these so-called weight loss “miracles,” but that shouldn’t be surprising when you consider how heavily pharmaceutical companies advertise in the mainstream media. No one working for these outlets would want to write anything that risks upsetting the companies helping pay their salary. Dr. Guy Hatchard, a natural medicine advocate with a Ph.D. in Psychology, recently called out the corporate media for this practice, focusing on a lead article in The New Zealand Herald entitled “Wellington company director Finlay Thompson loses 30kg taking Ozempic, wants medication funded.” Written by a young journalist, Ethan Manera, it discusses how the company director in question shed 66 pounds while participating in a U.S.-based trial of the drug and receiving it for free. As the trial period comes to a close, he is asking the government to fund the drug for himself and others who need to lose weight. In Thompson’s case, he simply can’t control his eating and has failed at multiple other attempts to lose weight. However, as the article pushes the government to pay for the medication, it fails to mention the drug’s price: $1,550 for a one-month supply. When you consider the fact that a 2021 survey found that a third of New Zealand adults were overweight, the math is clear: If the country’s government funded Ozempic for all 1.35 million people who need it, it would cost them nearly their entire national health budget of $25 billion. Media ignoring the dangers of weight loss drugs Another important aspect of the drug the article overlooks is its dangers. Several studies have linked it to gastrointestinal disturbances and gall stones. Many people have experienced gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis, as the drug slows down the emptying of the stomach, helping patients feel full. Intestinal blockage, bowel obstruction and other problems have also been reported. Even more alarmingly, some recent findings point to a long-term risk of deadly cancers like pancreatic and thyroid cancer, as well as diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. The piece also failed to mention how nine out of ten people who take drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy stop early because of their negative effects, nor did it go into how people have reported losing their sense of fun and experiencing depression and thoughts of suicide while taking these medications. This is something that certainly won’t be helped by going off the drug as many people report the weight returns as soon as they stop using it. Drug makers stand to make a lot of money on these injections, and the number of obese people in the world gives them a huge customer base that could help them see the kind of profits they earned the last time they used the media to pull the wool over people’s eyes, during the pandemic. This means we’re going to see a lot more one-sided articles that tout the drug’s dramatic weight loss effects while ignoring safer and equally effective approaches that no one profits from, setting overweight people up for even more health problems.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-essential-tips-preparing-for-extreme-heat-dehydration.html,Prepping and hydration: Essential tips for preparing for extreme heat,"Picnics and outdoor activities are fun when the weather is great, but you should remember that spending too much time in the sun during summer can also be dangerous. Excessive heat exposure can cause dehydration, which can cause hazardous conditions, such as heat cramps. Fortunately, you can take measures to protect your family from the heat and sun if you want to stay healthy and active this summer. (h/t to Healthline.com ) What to wear What you wear can help you stay comfortable outside in the blazing sun. The right type of clothing When it's hot and sunny, you can stay cool with a loose white linen shirt. Remember that dark clothing absorbs more heat, and tight clothes don’t let sweat, the human body's natural ""cooling system,"" evaporate. Cotton is also a great fabric for hot weather. Wear light colors instead of darker ones to stay cool. Sun-protective clothing When choosing your clothes for outdoor activities, you should know the difference between clothing that keeps you cool in the heat and clothing that keeps you protected from ultraviolet (UV) rays . Sun-protective items, like clothing, are given an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating based on how much UV radiation they allow to penetrate the skin. If a product has a UPF of 15, around 6.7 percent (or 1/15) of the sun's rays will reach your skin. A UPF rating of 15 is considered good, but an item must have a UPF of at least 30 to receive the Skin Cancer Foundation's Seal of Recommendation. Sunglasses Sunglasses will prevent UV rays from harming your corneas and will protect your eyes. Hats Wear a wide-brimmed hat to prevent UV rays from hitting the sensitive spots on your face. Organic sunscreen If you need to work outdoors, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Cover the areas that burn easily, such as your nose, ears, shoulders and the back of your neck. Lip balm While sunscreen protects the rest of your skin, a lip balm with SPF protection blocks out the sun and keeps moisture for your lips. Tips for staying hydrated The heat makes you sweat, which helps you cool down. But sweating also means that you’re constantly losing fluid. Follow these tips to stay hydrated : Drink water throughout the day During summer or a bad heatwave, you shouldn't wait until you’re thirsty to take sips of water. Drinking water throughout the day can prevent dehydration or over-exhaustion. The color of your urine can tell you if you are hydrated enough. The clearer, the better. If it's yellow or darker, it's time to drink more water. (Related: Must-have items for your heatwave emergency kit .) Drink sugar-free juice All-natural juice without added sugar provides hydration and it also has important nutrients to keep you active and nourished in hot weather. Vitamin C is one of these essential nutrients. Check the label on the juice bottle to see if it says ""100 percent juice with no sugar added.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-charges-withdrawn-4-canadians-refused-covid-vaccine-mandate.html,Charges withdrawn against 4 Canadians who refused to comply with COVID-19 vaccine mandate,"Four Canadians who did not comply with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate as ArriveCAN requirements at the Toronto Pearson International Airport had charges against them withdrawn . But they're not exactly happy with the decision. ""This outcome is bittersweet for each of our clients,"" said Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) lawyer Chris Fleury. ""It is positive for each of them personally. On the other hand, they were deeply interested in seeking a determination of the constitutionality of the irrational and unscientific decision forcing unvaccinated Canadians to quarantine."" The withdrawn charges include those against Elim Sly-Hooten of British Columbia, who felt that his personal medical information should remain private and chose not to disclose his vaccination status via ArriveCAN at the said airport. Peel Regional Police and Public Health Agency of Canada personnel detained him. Sly-Hooten eventually revealed his vaccination status due to intense pressure and the fact that he did not have counsel. He received a $5,000 ticket for violating the?Quarantine Act?and was ordered to quarantine in his home for 14 days. Sly-Hooten, with the help of JCCF, launched a constitutional challenge against ArriveCAN. He cited his right to liberty, his right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure , his right to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention and his right to counsel after arrest and detention. Other travelers whose tickets were withdrawn were Mark Spence, Aaron Grubb and Evan Kraayenbrink. They were also charged for choosing not to provide information on the app and also ordered to quarantine for two weeks. ArriveCAN has been criticized since its implementation. Canada Border Services Agency launched ArriveCAN in April 2020 and mandated in November 2020 in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic. The $59.5 million scandal-ridden travel app was used to track the COVID-19 jab status. All travelers entering Canada had to use it to submit their travel and contact information as well as any COVID-19 vaccination details before crossing the border or boarding a flight. (Related: HIGHWAY ROBBERY: Watchdog finds 75% of contractors paid by government did not work on Canada’s $54M ArriveCAN COVID-19 travel app, which ""could've been built in a weekend for $200,000."" ) Quebec recommends vaccine mandate this fall Since vaccine mandate is still considered constitutional in Canada, Quebec's immunization committee has released recommendations on administering vaccines this fall through a report published earlier in the week. The committee report warned that people who have never had COVID-19 are more likely to develop complications following their first infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite good vaccination coverage because the effectiveness of the vaccine tends to wane after several months, especially when new variants emerge. It also said that the likelihood of experiencing severe symptoms leading to hospitalization is much higher for elderly people and that risk is compounded when a person has a chronic illness. ""The vaccine is very effective in preventing severe hospitalization. It's not as effective to prevent transmission,"" said Dr. Nicholas Brousseau, a public health physician at the National Public Health Institute of Quebec. ""That's why our recommendations target at-risk people."" The committee is also recommending that the government wait for the availability of vaccines that are better adapted to new strains circulating before launching the next vaccination campaign. ""By fall 2024, it is expected that new versions of COVID-19 vaccines, targeting one or more strains closer to those currently in circulation, will be developed and authorized,"" the report indicated.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-over-300-suspected-heat-related-deaths-investigation.html,Over 300 suspected heat-related deaths under investigation in Maricopa County,"More than 300 deaths suspected to be linked to this summer's record-breaking heat wave are being investigated in Maricopa County, Arizona. The county's heat report dashboard this year indicates that 322 deaths are suspected to have been due to heat-related illnesses as of July 13. Almost 100 of those suspected heat deaths happened from July 7 to 13, when temperatures reached 118 degrees. (Related: Must-have items for your heatwave emergency kit .) There have been 23 confirmed deaths in Maricopa related to heat so far this year, 17 of which were directly caused by heat and the six others of which were ""heat-contributed."" ""We know that June was hotter than June last year,"" said Dr. Nick Staab, assistant medical director of Maricopa County Department of Public Health . ""We know that the risk for heat-related death increases with those higher temperatures."" There were 579 confirmed deaths related to heat in Maricopa last year, and 386 in 2022, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services . The health department said a quarter of last year's deaths happened indoors, with air conditioning units not working properly for two-thirds of those victims. Heat is the top cause of weather-related fatalities nationwide. But because investigations of suspected heat deaths can take months, and counties use a mishmash of methods to count them, it is difficult to know exactly how many people died in the recent heat waves. There have been at least 73 confirmed heat-related deaths across the U.S. this year, according to an ongoing count by NBC News . In Phoenix, an average temperature of 97 degrees Fahrenheit made it the hottest June in the city's more than 100 years of temperature records, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Parts of Nevada and Texas also endured their hottest June on record In neighboring Nevada, Las Vegas sizzled to its temperature record in June. ""Almost any way you slice it, June 2024 was the hottest ever in Las Vegas,"" the local office of the NWS wrote on X. The previous record was set eight years ago, in 2016. Triple-digit temperatures were recorded nearly every day last month, the weather service said. The average temperature in June was 94.6 degrees, which was seven degrees above normal and 1.8 degrees hotter than the previous record. The heat was also persistent. The average high temperature hit 106.2 degrees, and the average low temperature touched 83 degrees, meaning the city had little relief from the heat even overnight. But it wasn't just the milestones that were notable, the National Weather Service said. ""What's more impressive is how much we beat the old records by,"" the National Weather Service wrote on X, adding that June's average high temperature beat the previous record by 1.2 degrees, a bigger margin than what separates second and eighth place. It was a scorching June in West Texas, as well. El Paso had its hottest June on record, breaking a record that had stood for 30 years. The average temperature in the border city hit 89.4 degrees, which was 0.4 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 1994. Extreme heat is expected to persist across the West Coast and parts of the South. Heat advisories and excessive heat warnings are in effect in Washington State, Oregon, California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Florida.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-25-the-biden-titanic.html,The Biden Titanic,"Joe Biden’s escalating dementia and the long media-political conspiracy to hide his senility from the public are the least of the Democrats’ current problems. (Article Victor Davis Hanson republished from AMGreatness.com ) Biden’s track record as president may be more concerning than his cognitive decline. He has literally destroyed the U.S. border, deliberately allowing the entry of more than 10 million illegal aliens. His callous handlers’ agenda was to import abjectly poor constituencies in need of vast government services without regard for the current struggles of a battered American middle class and poor. The widespread poverty of a vast new cohort of illegal immigrants could serve as indictments of a “racist,” “unequal,” and “unfair” America—as if the residents of East Palestine, Ohio or inner-city Chicago had anything to do with the centuries-long corruption and oppression of Mexico and Latin America that daily drives thousands of their own poorest citizens northwards to a society founded on very different ideas than those of their homelands. Note that the left, neither in Mexico nor in America, never asks why millions of these impoverished people prefer to break into a supposedly racist America. Much less do they even distinguish those principles and values that once made America prosperous, free, and secure from their antitheses that have sadly made much of Latin America mostly poor, without freedom, and insecure. Biden inherited near-zero real interest rates and inflation at 1.4 percent. Almost immediately, in nihilistic fashion, Biden did to a sound economy what he had done to a secure border. So, he recklessly printed money at a time of spiraling, quarantine-ending demand and supply chain disruption. Middle-class wages never caught up with Biden’s inflation, as prices for key staples are nearly 30 percent higher than when he took office. The cost of servicing the ballooning national debt at high interest is now nearly $1 trillion per year. The world abroad is aflame, lit by Biden’s inexplicable withdrawal from Kabul, his mixed signals to Vladimir Putin on the eve of his invasion of Ukraine, his deliberate alienation of Israel, his appeasement of Iran and China, and his cuts in the defense budget, coupled with his woke war on mythical “racists” in the military. Energy prices soared, even as Biden’s green agenda proved unworkable and prompted draining the strategic petroleum reserve and begging foreign oil despots before key elections. The “unifier” Biden by design needlessly alienated nearly half the country, and in his debate, he reiterated why Trump supporters do not deserve his concern. And more ominously and recently, Biden grossly told hundreds of his donors that “it’s time to put Trump in a bullseye”—just days before the attempt on Trump’s life. The greatest absurdity of the Biden White House is the gaslighting talk of Biden’s “achievements.” Biden’s actions over the last four years are not offsets for his senility that warrant his continuance in office, but again, sadly, they serve as force multipliers, furthering claims of his dementia and for his removal. Joe Biden is not just non compos mentis and in a sane world, he would be subject to 25 th Amendment removal. He also increasingly seems unpleasant and obnoxious, if not sometimes simply weird. To achieve momentary clarity, Biden either shouts at his audience or stoops over and whispers in an eerie fashion. He insults reporters and his own staff. Every few sentences, without warning, he begins screaming. His face is fixed in a permanent, angry contortion. As a result, the public sees their president as an off-putting, angry old man—and in his selfish dotage, an increasingly unsympathetic one. Even after more than 40 months of media hagiography, Joe Biden still cannot poll over a 40 percent approval rating, given that his rudeness is fueled further by the day due to escalating mental confusion. Biden is, to be candid, a serial prevaricator. It is not just his ad nauseam repetition of Trump’s supposed slurs—the Charlottesville “both sides” lie, the “suckers” lie, or the “bloodbath” lie. He continues to peddle absolute falsehoods like the mythical nine-percent inflation he inherited and Trump’s supposed intention to ban all abortions, or his whopper that after welcoming in 10 million illegal aliens, Biden would have had a closed, secure border if not for those selfish Republicans who, for some reason, did not trust his ridiculous eleventh-hour, election-timed immigration proposal. When he hammers Trump as a “convicted felon,” Biden has no clue that a majority of Americans equate that charge with Biden’s own warped lawfare assault on ancient customs, as well as a reminder that his now closest advisor is likewise a “convicted felon.” When Biden rants near daily about the rich “paying their fair share,” he reminds us that his son is also facing federal tax evasion charges for unreported foreign income in the millions of dollars and that as soon as Biden himself leaves office, as a recipient of the same foreign cash, he may find himself in the same legal jeopardy. So, to use a Bidenism, “how dare he” accuse affluent Americans of the very crimes that his own family is knee deep in? Biden’s prefaces of “no lie,” “here’s the deal,” “no kidding,” and “no joke” are little more than tics that forewarn us of complete fabrications about to follow, from the ridiculous story of an uncle supposedly eaten by New Guinea cannibals to his supposed heroics during the Civil Rights movement and his near childhood adoption by various minority communities. In this regard, senility served oddly as a crutch for Biden. In the past, he paid dearly for his plagiarism, cheating, racist rants, and prevarications, losing three presidential bids and earning a reputation as the empty-suit blowhard of the Senate. Now his press handlers conveniently chalk up his long-standing habitual untruth as momentary mental “confusion.” Given all the above, remember that Biden was to be the “savior” of the Democratic Party. To this day, celebrities demanding his withdrawal from the race throw him the bone that “he saved the country by stopping Trump”—as if no wars, stability abroad, no inflation, low interest, and low energy costs were something to fear. Yet Biden’s four years pale in comparison to what in 2016 might have been a Harris, Buttigieg, Warren, Booker, or Sanders candidacy or presidency. No wonder Democrats concluded that there were no viable alternatives to a cognitively challenged Biden, precisely because Biden was the only available fig leaf to the new Democratic Party and its neo-socialist agenda—that, if transparent, would have terrified the country that it was soon to nearly destroy. Biden’s Democratic critics have it all wrong: removing Biden is wise and needed for the country’s sake, but it will not solve the growing public anger at the left. Without the veneer of even a tottering old Joe from Scranton, there will be no camouflage. And then, the true leftist agenda will be served raw to the American people—open borders, woke/DEI racial polarization, transgendered obsessions, inflation/stagflation, wars a plenty abroad, an inert Pentagon, unaffordable energy, partial-birth abortions, and crazy ideas like packing the court and making Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, states. So, what is the Democratic strategy to win the 2024 election? Certainly, an “open” convention would not produce a moderate Democratic nominee or even a suitable replacement façade. There are no moderates in contention. If there were any hale candidates to offer cover, the party would be in permanent war with its shrill and angry woke base. Joe is the last of his generation to offer a credible front. There are no more Diane Feinsteins or Bill Clintons to package the hard-left agenda. If Harris cannot serve as Biden’s replacement, someone like her or further to the left would appear on spec. The Democrats have no plans to run on their record. Their tripartite strategy is as simple as it is tired and worn. First, expect a third chapter to follow the 2016 Russian collusion caper and the 2020 laptop disinformation ruse—likely some October revelation from the administrative state’s “experts” and “authorities” that Trump is a criminal, a traitor, or a spy or plans a coup, to destroy NATO or nuke something. Perhaps there is another Access Hollywood tape, a porn star on ice, anything to avoid discussing the damage done since 2017. Second, there is still a last gasp to a dying lawfare. Never underestimate the last-gasp judicial effort to inactivate, gag, bankrupt, or jail Trump, however counterproductive such attempts so far have proved. Third, when all else fails, remember that in many of the swing states, 70 percent of the electorate will not be voting on Election Day and will not be presenting IDs. Millions of their ballots will be harvested or cured by third-party activists. Last time around, the leftist journalist Molly Ball bragged about their “cabal” and “conspiracy” of big money and big tech that had “saved” Americans from Trump. Those post-election confessions were not just high-fiving but also a confident forewarning of what is to come. Read more at: AMGreatness.com"
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-european-court-of-justice-rules-against-pfizer.html,"European Court of Justice rules against Pfizer and the European Commission’s secretive, liability-free contracts","On July 17, 2024, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission (one of the three branches of the European Union) wrongfully withheld critical details regarding its multi-billion-euro contracts with Pfizer, for the mass distribution of their so-called COVID-19 vaccines. This decision marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny facing European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is already under fire for privately conspiring with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to mass distribute Pfizer’s experimental shots. According to Ursula’s own confessions, she privately texted Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 11 contracts, 4.6 billion in vaccines, while transferring €71 billion of public money to Big Pharma. In 2020, Ursula told the New York Times she was texting Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 1.9 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine for the entire EU population, which is just 448 million people. This liability-free contract protects Pfizer, while exploiting all Europeans without recourse when the vaccines damage them. European Court exposes corrupt EU and opens up possibility of lawsuits against Pfizer The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit initiated by Green MEPs in October 2021, demanding full disclosure of the vaccine purchase agreements negotiated by the European Commission. The MEPs argued that transparency was essential to understand the terms and conditions under which these crucial agreements were made. Despite months of correspondence, the Commission only provided heavily redacted versions of the contracts, prompting the legal challenge. The General Court of the European Union ultimately sided with the MEPs, emphasizing that the Commission's decision to redact significant portions of the contract was unjustified. The court criticized the Commission's withholding of specific clauses related to indemnification. These indemnification clauses grant Pfizer immunity when their vaccines cause adverse events. The court contended that the Commission failed to substantiate how disclosing these provisions would harm the commercial interests of Pfizer. By concealing the indemnification clause, it appears that Pfizer and Commission knew that the vaccine would cause damage to the population, and all harms could be absolved by the contract, without anyone knowing about the secret agreement. These secretive contracts with Pfizer defrauded the public, leading to policies that suspended civil liberties, while misleading and coercively harming individuals amid the implementation of a global vaccine agenda and a biosecurity police state. Tilly Metz, one of the Green MEPs involved in the lawsuit, said, ""The new European Commission must now adapt their handling of access to documents requests to be in line with today’s ruling.” Pfizer can be held accountable for “defective product” despite its secret indemnity clause signed with the EU Beyond the transparency issue, the court's ruling also addressed the liability of pharmaceutical companies in cases of vaccine defects. It emphasized that under EU law, producers cannot limit their liability if harm is caused by a defective product. This aspect of the ruling clarifies that Pfizer and other vaccine manufacturers could be held liable for damages resulting from vaccine defects, contrary to previous assumptions about limited liability in such cases. The ruling invokes Directive 85/374/EEC, which defines the responsibilities of producers regarding defective products, including provisions on damage caused by death or personal injuries. The court clarified that a producer is liable for the damage caused by a defect in its product and its liability ""cannot be limited or excluded vis-à-vis the victim by a clause limiting, or providing an exemption from, liability under Directive 85/374."" This interpretation by the European Court of Justice potentially opens the door for legal claims against Pfizer. The decision has exposed the treacherous and clandestine handling of vaccine contracts at the onset of the lockdowns and the forced COVID-19 vaccine experiment . This decision will have broader implications for public health policy and challenge the role of the EU and centralized authorities over personal medical decisions. Transparency is crucial not only for the sake of holding pharmaceutical companies accountable, but also for the sake of informed consent and saving lives. If more people knew that Pfizer was conspiring with the EU and crafting a secret indemnity clause when their vaccine harmed people, then there would have been far less participation in the global vaccine agenda, and ultimately more lives would have been spared.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-mumps-merck-mmr-vaccine-4x-live-virus.html,"Mumps component of Merck’s MMR vaccine contains up to 4x the approved amount of live virus: “fraud, pure and simple”","For many years, pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. has lied about the safety and efficacy of its mumps vaccine. A lawsuit exposing the company for ""overfilling"" its combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple-vaccine with too much live mumps virus in order to meet efficacy targets. Merck was never granted approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to do such, which means the company has been engaging in fraud. Two Merck whistleblowers sued the company over all this back in 2010 under the False Claims Act. On July 9, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia heard oral arguments in the case. Brian Hooker, PhD, chief scientific officer at Children's Health Defense, says MMR II, as the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine from Merck is officially called, claims the amount of live mumps virus the company is adding to each vial is upwards of 400 percent beyond the approved limit. Keep in mind that MMR comes in two doses and is scheduled by the U.S. government for injection into children between 12 and 18 months old. (Related: Did you know that for over a decade, Merck defrauded the public about the true dangers of its MMR vaccine?) How many children are chronically ill or dead because of Merck fraud? Dr. David Kessler, a former FDA head, further claims that Merck lied to regulators by submitting passive surveillance reports, meaning reports from parents regarding any vaccine reactions in their children, to identify potential safety signals with MMR. By all appearances, Merck knew that what it was doing, and could still be doing, was wrong and in violation of the law, but did it anyway for those sweet, sweet profits. ""What is in the Merck MMR II vaccine is not what is being reported,"" Hooker told ""The Defender In-Depth."" ""This is a live virus vaccine, and these viruses are at higher concentrations,"" Hooker continued. ""And we know, as far as the mumps vaccine, that the concentrations that are in the vials have never been tested for safety."" The last time the guidelines for the MMR II vaccine were changed was in 1999 as a result of an FDA action showing that the mumps component was losing potency within its established two-year shelf life before expiration. Rather than reformulate the injection in accordance with the law, Merck took the cheaper route of simply increasing the concentration of the shot's live mumps virus component by a factor of four without informing regulators. ""The mumps portion of the vaccine lost its potency to an ineffective and an unacceptable endpoint, and the FDA notified Merck of this in 1998,"" Hooker said. ""In order to compensate for this, Merck merely did something that is called 'overfill' to the virus, overfilled the vials to a higher starting level."" ""They started out with … 100,000 TCID50,"" he added, referring to the measure of the number of viral particles in a vaccine. ""They changed that to 160,000 active virus particles in 1999."" From a production standpoint, this means that the exact middle concentration of the mumps virus component of MMR II is 160,000. Each vial can deviate by as much as four times more than that, meaning as high as 600,000 viral particles. In the other direction, the shot could contain as low as 100,000 viral particles. To have this much variance between individual vials is simply astounding in terms of the potential impact on a baby. One baby might get the 100,000 viral particles injection while the next gets the 600,000 viral particles injection. What are the risks? Nobody knows since it has never been studied thanks to Merck fraud. Pharmaceutical and vaccine fraud is nothing new: it's Big Pharma's entire business model. Learn more at BadMedicine.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-no-cure-in-sight-for-mrna-vaccine-injury.html,NO CURE in sight for the mRNA VACCINE INJURY pandemic,"Let’s start this off with the fact that Fraudulent Fauci knew about horrific injuries incurred during the mRNA jab clinical trials. If only there were a vaccine to cure people of the vaccine injury pandemic. Now for that, there’s a Nobel prize waiting to be awarded. It is documented that more than 36,000 Americans are now suffering a plethora of debilitating side effects along with a declining neurological condition caused by the mRNA jab. This vaccine injury pandemic is happening across all brands of the mRNA gene-mutating injections. If you or a loved one has been health devastated by the Fauci Flu jab, visit react19.org for science-based support for people suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine side effects. There you can register your injury and share in the research for finding a cure for SPS – Spike Protein Syndrome , that’s sweeping the nation and the world right now. The mRNA vaccine injury pandemic is sweeping the globe right now Tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands who haven’t come forward) are now unable to work or care for their families because they trusted Big Pharma to inject them with gene-altering “technology” that would protect them from the lab-concocted gain-of-function virus known as Covid-19, or “coronavirus.” Now they're suffering from Long-Vax-Syndrome. We are not talking about minor, short-term side effects or “adverse events” like swelling at the injection spot, itching and rashes, headaches or flu-like symptoms. These folks suffering from Spike Protein Syndrome can’t even exercise because their heart is so strained to pump blood through their system quick enough that they feel like they’re about to have a heart attack, and many do; countless have died this way. This includes people who were perfectly healthy BEFORE the jab, including top-level athletes, military members, doctors, pilots and health-conscious consumers. Big Pharma (The Vaccine Industrial Complex) knows this, and that’s why they have colluded with Big Government to create laws restricting the vaccine-injured folks and families of the vaccine-exterminated from filing claims against the vaccine manufacturers. The government instead directs you to their fake front called “Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program"" (CICP), which rejects more than 97 percent of all applicants without any consideration whatsoever. Vaccine Injury Compensation Modernization Act Wait, because there is hope. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Modernization Act, also known as H.R. 5142, offers a solution to this seemingly dead end. This act addresses the backlog of cases and increases compensation caps that have been in place for nearly 4 decades. Urge your representative to co-sponsor or vote YES on HR 5142, introduced by Rep Dogget (D) TX and Smucker (R) PA. Also, you should urge your senator to draft a companion bill, and you can literally work with the help committee to draft this bill. Spike Protein Syndrome is very complex, as it features a constellation of strong symptoms that debilitate several major body systems that all work in tandem. Many victims of the Vaccine Injury Pandemic are experiencing severe neurological problems, digestive issues, vascular blood-flow complications (from rubbery clots the nano-particles form in the blood vessels), brain injuries, damage to the 5 senses and what’s being termed “turbo cancer,” because of the rapid, rare progression of tumors that were minor, receding or had disappeared prior to the jabs. The mRNA vaccines literally wake up cancer , and this is even according to Pfizer’s CEO, as also witnessed by oncologists across the globe. People are wondering why their nerves, cells and immune system are being attacked, but there is a simple explanation. The mRNA jabs fool the human cells into producing millions of microscopic toxic particles that mimic a deadly, foreign virus. These particles spread throughout the body, to vital organs, the brain, the uterus, the intestines, and they feed cancer cells. The human immune system naturally responds by attacking these foreign particles, that are everywhere. In other words, there’s a constant fight-or-flight WAR that’s going on in the body, and it taxes every system, causing chronic, severe inflammation, disease, disorders and early death. Help find a cure. Stop vaccine violence. Bookmark Vaccines.news to your favorite independent websites for updates on Long-Vax-Syndrome that's sweeping the nation and the world as you read this. "

During an interview with Black Entertainment Television (BET) on July 17, Biden made the statement while discussing his efforts to appoint Black individuals to prominent positions within his administration. (Related: Biden mixes up names of world leaders during NATO Summit in Washington .) ""It's all about treating people with dignity. For example, look at the heat I'm getting because I named a, uh, the secretary of defense, [unintelligible] Black man,"" Biden said. He then mentioned Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Black woman, as another example of his appointees. The ambiguity of whether Biden used ""a"" or ""the"" before describing Austin as Black added fuel to the debate. Some social media users on X expressed concerns about Biden's mental acuity. One even argued that the clip was being misconstrued. ""I think people are misconstruing this clip. If you listen closely, Biden seems to say 'the secretary of defense, a black man' not 'the black man'; and the context is he's listing his black appointees,"" the X user posted. But critics accused the president of forgetting Austin's name and simply referring to him as ""the black man."" ""Let’s see how the Biden dead-enders spin this one,"" one user posted on X. ""A POTUS who cannot remember the name of his SecDef — and instead calls him 'the black man' – is not mentally equipped to be in charge of 5,000 nuclear weapons,"" another one posted. Pierson in 2020: Biden has a long history of dehumanizing black Americans This incident adds to a series of verbal gaffes by Biden over the decades, who has faced criticism for previous remarks about black voters and race. In 2007, Biden faced backlash for describing then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama as "" the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean."" ""I mean, you got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"" Biden was quoted as saying. ""I mean, that's a storybook, man."" Biden apologized the next day after the incident but insisted that his comments were taken out of context. ""I deeply regret any offense my remark in the New York Observer might have caused anyone. That was not my intent and I expressed that to Sen. Obama,"" he said. ""Barack Obama is probably the most exciting candidate that the Democratic or Republican Party has produced at least since I've been around. And he's fresh. He's new. He's smart. He's insightful. And I really regret that some have taken totally out of context my use of the word 'clean.' My mother has an expression: clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack."" In 2019, he received backlash for saying ""poor kids"" were ""just as bright and just as talented as White kids."" In 2020, Biden told radio host Charlamagne tha God that Black voters who were unsure whether to vote for him were not Black, a remark for which he later apologized. At the time, Trump's top advisers Katrina Pierson and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the Senate, condemned Biden for the remark. Pierson accused Biden of having a history of dehumanizing comments toward Black Americans, while Scott described Biden’s statement as ""negative race-baiting.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-washington-bankrolls-moderna-mrna-bird-flu-vaccine.html,SCARE TACTICS: U.S. government gives Moderna $176 million to develop mRNA bird flu vaccine for next fake scamdemic,"The U.S. government has given $176 million to Moderna with the intention of developing an mRNA vaccine against avian influenza. The government funds were coursed through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) . The money will be used to finish developing and testing an mRNA injection against the H5N1 strain of bird flu pending the results of Phase 1 clinical trials, which are expected to be completed this month. Late-stage testing of the vaccine is set to begin in 2025. The $176 million contract between Washington and the Massachusetts-based Moderna allows for accelerated vaccine development should human H5N1 cases and/or their severity continue to grow. It shares similarities with the earlier Operation Warp Speed, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) shot development initiative in 2020. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel confirmed that his company received the $176 million federal grant in a statement, adding: ""mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks."" The bird flu virus primarily infects birds but can sometimes infect other animals. It spreads through direct contact with infected birds or their droppings, feathers, or saliva. But following the failures of COVID-19 and monkeypox to usher in the medical police state globalists are much eager to impose, they have now turned to bird flu as the next ""disease to watch out for"" – and the next tool for making the population submit. (Related: International Bird Flu Summit discussing ""mass fatality management plan"" to be held in Washington, D.C. before the election. ) The first outbreak of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in dairy cattle was reported in March, and the avian virus reportedly has since infected more than 130 cattle herds in 12 states. Given this, health authorities have expressed concern over the possibility of the bird flu virus mutating and jumping to humans. However, such a possibility would only be true if the virus was subjected to manipulation in a laboratory. Public health officials ramp up the bird flu fearmongering According to Dawn O'Connell, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, the risk of bird flu to the general public remains low and vaccination is not currently recommended. However, she added that the government is expected to have more announcements on bird flu vaccines soon. Aside from Moderna, the government is also in negotiations with Pfizer about developing an mRNA vaccine for bird flu. Like many viral infections, infected individuals can have mild symptoms or none at all. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the most common symptoms in those affected with bird flu include pink eye (conjunctivitis), fever, sore throat and cough, with pneumonia being a serious complication. While H5N1 is not currently transmissible between humans, other experts including former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield warned that could change. Back in 2012, he touched on gain-of-function research and the ease of making H5N1 highly pathogenic. ""I really do think it's very like that we will, at some time – it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when – have a bird flu pandemic,"" Redfield said at the time. ""I know exactly what amino acids I have to change because in 2012, against my recommendation, the scientists that did these experiments actually published them. So the recipe for how to make bird flu highly infectious for humans is already out there.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-ecj-rules-pfizer-liable-covid-vaccine-defective.html,European Court of Justice: Pfizer LIABLE for damage if its COVID-19 injection is defective,"According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), drug manufacturer Pfizer is liable for damage if its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injection is found to be defective. The ECJ's July 17 ruling argued that the idea of COVID-19 vaccine makers having limited liability for vaccine-related injuries or deaths is not entirely true. ""A producer is liable for the damage caused by a defect in its product and its liability cannot be limited or excluded,"" the decision stated. ""However, there is no provision … that prohibits a third party from reimbursing the damages which a producer has paid as a result of its product being defective."" The Daily Expose continued: ""That means if Pfizer's product is defective and people are harmed by that product, then the victims can seek damages from Pfizer. For any damages that Pfizer pays out, Pfizer can seek reimbursements from a third party – for example, BioNTech."" According to the ECJ ruling, ""a producer is liable for the damage caused by a defect in its product."" (Related: Former CDC Director calls out FDA's under-reporting of COVID-19 vaccine side effects in congressional hearing .) ""Producer"" is defined as ""the manufacturer of a finished product, the producer of any raw material or the manufacturer of a component part and any person who, by putting his name, trade mark or other distinguishing feature on the product presents himself as its producer."" It also applies to any person who imports a product for sale or any form of distribution in the European Community in the course of their business. Meanwhile, the definition of ""damage"" includes ""damage caused by death or by personal injuries."" According to the Expose , ""the COVID-19 vaccines have caused death and personal injury"" despite the public being deceived about the injections being ""safe and effective."" ECJ also deems efforts to conceal vaccine contracts ILLEGAL The ECJ's July 17 ruling also annulled the European Commission's (EC) decision to conceal certain parts of COVID-19 vaccine contracts inked by EC President Ursula Von der Leyen. The concealment was done as part of her efforts to gain support for her reelection bid. Back in October 2021, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the Green bloc asked for access to the COVID-19 vaccine contracts with Pfizer negotiated by the EC to know the terms and conditions of the agreements. However, they were only provided with redacted versions of the said contracts. But the ECJ ruled that Von der Leyen was wrong to conceal details of its multi-billion euro deals for the COVID-19 vaccines. It also noted that the EC did not give sufficient access to the purchase agreements. This ruling serves as a major blow to Von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term as EC president. She was already under scrutiny for allegedly keeping secret and deleting text messages with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla over vaccine purchases in a controversy dubbed ""Deletegate."" ""The new European Commission must now adapt their handling of access to documents requests to be in line with today’s ruling,"" said Tilly Metz of Luxembourg, one of the Green MEPs who filed the lawsuit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-24-halting-puberty-blockers-doesnt-increase-suicide-ideation.html,U.K. report: Halting puberty blockers DOES NOT increase suicide ideation in gender-confused youth,"A recent independent review has found no evidence that halting the prescription of puberty blockers to transgender-identifying children leads to a significant rise in suicides . The review, commissioned by the government of the United Kingdom and conducted by psychiatrist Louis Appleby, head of the National Health Service's (NHS) Suicide Prevention Strategy programs, was published on July 19 under the title ""Review of suicides and gender dysphoria at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust: independent report."" (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing… chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) Appleby, a professor of psychiatry and experienced suicide researcher from the University of Manchester , was tasked by Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting to scrutinize the evidence following claims by LGBT activists that suicide rates were escalating due to restrictions on puberty blockers implemented in 2020. The review, which covered data from NHS England on suicide patients at the Tavistock and Portman clinic from 2018 to 2019 and 2023 to 2024, only found 12 suicides. Five in the three years leading up to 2020 to 2021 and seven in the three years afterward. For those under 18, there were three suicides before and three after 2020 to 2021. Appleby concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support the claim of a large rise in suicides among young gender dysphoria patients at the Tavistock and Portman clinic. The discussion of this issue on social media has been insensitive, distressing and dangerous, contradicting guidelines on the safe reporting of suicide. Public claims regarding suicide rates do not meet basic standards for statistical evidence. It is crucial to move away from the notion that access to puberty blockers is the primary marker of non-judgmental acceptance in healthcare for gender dysphoric youth. Moreover, Appleby noted that trans activists' rhetoric about suicidality could inadvertently harm gender-confused children. The irresponsible assertions that puberty blockers are essential to prevent inevitable suicides could lead to adolescents mimicking this behavior. ""These numbers do not show a statistically significant difference,"" Appleby stated in his report. He also stressed the need for careful interpretation of small data sets, while ensuring high-quality data collection to improve the safety of these children. Study: A third of children on puberty blockers end up with deteriorating mental health A 2023 analysis of a 2011 study conducted by University College London Hospitals (UCLH) and Gender Identity Development Service revealed that over a third of children placed on puberty blockers suffered from deteriorating mental health . The new analysis, led by professor of psychology and sociology Susan McPherson of the University of Essex and retired social scientist David Freedman, indicates that 34 percent of children experienced a ""reliable deterioration"" in mental health after taking puberty-blocking drugs, while 37 percent saw no change and only 29 percent showed ""reliable improvement."" This contrasts sharply with the 2011 study, which claimed ""no changes in psychological function"" after the treatment. The initial analysis was based on group averages from questionnaires given to children and their parents, whereas the recent analysis focused on individual results. McPherson and Freedman claimed that their methodology offers a ""greater indication as to variation across participants,"" providing a more nuanced understanding of the treatment's impact. ""This complementary analytic approach allows us to look at how a treatment is performing in terms of the percentage of patients improving, deteriorating and showing clinically significant change,"" the researchers said at the time. ""It is possible, using this approach, to look at patterns, such as who is benefitting and who is not. We recommend that these approaches be incorporated into new GD [gender dysphoria] services being established in the U.K. as well as new research studies being designed.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-heart-failure-surge-linked-to-covid-vaccines.html,Heart failure surge among children linked to COVID-19 vaccines,"Heart failure has been on the rise among children recently, and a new study has linked this phenomenon to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines . In the last three years, medical professionals have observed a rise in children with a range of heart problems, such as myocarditis and pericarditis, which were rare before COVID-19. Both of these conditions are well-known side effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Although the mainstream media often tries to paint these deaths as connected to the COVID-19 virus itself and not the vaccines, a new study shows that these conditions are only appearing in children following vaccination rather than infection with the virus. The study, which was carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford , looked at more than a million British children aged 5 to 15, comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects and considering the number of doses each one received. In addition to observing that hospitalizations related to infection with the virus itself were extremely rare among these age groups, they stated that no one in the entire subject population died as a result of the virus. Moreover, they noted: “All myocarditis and pericarditis events during the study period occurred in vaccinated individuals.” In the study, the researchers found that most pericarditis and myocarditis cases took place after children and adolescents received their first dose of the vaccine, with more than half of the adolescents who did experience these infections going to a hospital for treatment. Because it is possible to recover from myocarditis and pericarditis if it is detected in time and treated properly, the mainstream media has done its best to downplay these infections and their connection to the vaccines. However, one study found that half of all young men who get a COVID-19 vaccine and go on to develop myocarditis end up suffering from permanent heart damage. The study, which was peer-reviewed and published in the journal Circulation , did not get a lot of attention as the media continues to cover up vaccine side effects, but Dr. Drew Pinsky explained what could happen to the affected children in the future and said schools that issued mandates should be held accountable . ""That means that we don't know what percentage are going to be disabled by this as they get older or develop heart failure, or are going to need cardiac transplants, some of them. It's breathtaking, this study. And why it wasn't a big headline … I don't understand why people aren't reacting to it,"" he stated. (Related: CDC ""releases"" 148-page study on myocarditis following COVID ""vaccination"" – WITH EVERY PAGE REDACTED .) Even mild cases of myocarditis can be fatal Moreover, there is evidence that even mild cases of myocarditis can lead to fatal arrhythmias. One study, which was carried out by pathologists from Japan , described how a healthy 40-year-old man experienced tachycardia suddenly two days after receiving the jab, lost consciousness and ultimately died. That patient tested negative for the virus. The researchers noted that the man’s case of myocarditis had been “focal and mild, as is mostly observed following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.” Meanwhile, a different recent study, this one by researchers from Harvard Medical School , revealed that COVID-19 vaccines were responsible for a surge in sudden deaths seen throughout the world as a result of cerebral ischemia. This type of deadly brain damage is caused by insufficient flow of blood to the brain. The researchers determined that the spike could be attributed to the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Unfortunately, just as many people feared, we are learning more every day about the damage these vaccines cause , and their long-term effects will only grow more apparent with time. "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-ftc-urged-act-online-ads-junk-foods.html,Lawmakers urge Federal Trade Commission to take action against ONLINE ADS for junk foods,"A group of lawmakers has called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to tackle online advertisements for junk foods ostensibly aimed at younger viewers. The bipartisan group of lawmakers led by U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) made the request in a June 17 letter addressed to FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan and four other commissioners. It urged the FTC to update its decade-old report on food marketing to children and adolescents, emphasizing the need to address the rapidly evolving landscape of digital advertising. ""We are alarmed by the proliferation of unhealthy food and beverage marketing directed toward children across online platforms,"" the letter read. ""Such marketing can impact children's food preferences, purchase requests [and] consumption patterns, and could ultimately contribute to unhealthy eating patterns that increase the risk of chronic disease."" The lawmakers characterized the need for regulatory action as urgent, in light of projected increases in childhood diabetes rates and the billions spent annually on influencer marketing. ""We appreciate the FTC's consideration of this letter and we hope to see [the commission] further its work to protect children from online marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages,"" the letter continued. The correspondence by Booker and his colleagues in Congress zoomed in on two particular aspects of this online marketing. First, they expressed worry about how companies target ads to children in different socioeconomic and demographic groups. They cited a study that found Black children were exposed to between 86 and 119 percent more food and beverage TV ads than their White peers. Second, they highlighted the growing role of social media influencers in promoting unhealthy foods to young audiences. ""There are countless recent examples of influencers on TikTok promoting food and beverage products where it is not always made clear the influencer is being paid to promote these products or has a material connection to the brand,"" the lawmakers noted. Companies spend BILLIONS to bombard kids with ads Lindsey Smith Taillie, associate professor at the University of North Carolina 's Gillings School of Global Public Health, put in her two cents on the effects of digital marketing for unhealthy foods in an April op-ed published in The Hill . She recounted how her four-year-old child saw an ad for a candy brand during Super Bowl 2024. Two weeks after that, Taillie's child still remembered the ad – and right in time for their supermarket visit. ""A 30-second commercial seems harmless. However, new research shows that food marketing to kids is more than a nuisance. It's a key driver of poor diets,"" Taillie wrote. (Related: Junk food ads on TV strongly influence children's eating habits .) ""Food marketing impacts what kids like, buy and eat – increasing the risk of dental caries, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Like tobacco, tighter regulation of junk food marketing to children is needed to protect their health."" According to her, digital marketing is particularly worrisome as it does not look like marketing. This ""disguised"" promotion, she added, ""limits kids' ability to distinguish these marketing techniques from unbranded content."" Taillie ultimately concluded: ""Food marketing hooks kids on unhealthy foods, creating poor eating habits that can last a lifetime. Children deserve to live, learn and play free from the influence of the junk food industry, [and] regulations on food marketing can help."" Head over to JunkFood.news for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-world-scrambles-restore-normalcy-biggest-it-outage.html,World scrambles to restore normalcy amid biggest IT outage in history,"The world got a taste of just how badly our over-reliance on technology can backfire on Friday when a tech outage disrupted 911 systems and hospital operations, grounded flights and brought online banking and businesses to a standstill around the world. Many people were caught off guard by the sheer severity of the issues caused by the outage, and one of the most serious consequences is its effect on healthcare systems . Emergency response systems were down at various healthcare providers and police agencies in the U.S., with some areas having to dispatch police cars and ambulances manually. Elective surgeries and hospital visits were canceled at hospitals throughout the country. In England, meanwhile, the country's National Health Service said that its systems for managing patient records and making appointments with doctors was disrupted, affecting most of their general practitioner practices. The publicly funded National Healthcare System has had staff working manually using paper as it tries to provide treatment. In the U.S., major airlines such as United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Allegiant Air were forced to ground all of their flights. All of the airlines have warned that customers can expect to experience ongoing scheduled disruptions. Nearly 2,000 flights originating in or ending in the U.S. had been cancelled by Friday morning, while nearly 4,500 had been delayed. These airline disruptions extended beyond the U.S. to affect airports around the world , including Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, which is one of the busiest in Europe. London Gatwick is another airport that has reported widespread disruptions. Public services provided by the government have been closed or delayed in some parts of the U.S. For example, officials in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee are unable to access some of their drivers services, while Social Security offices were also closed to the public throughout the nation as the agency scrambles to restore services. Texas A&M University is one of several higher education institutes that canceled classes, while UPS warned customers that their packages could be delayed. Some billboards in New York City’s famous Times Square went dark, while numerous American TV stations were unable to air their local news. Many retail businesses struggled with payment processing. The outage was a technical glitch and not an attack, company claims The outage was reportedly caused by a faulty update from the Texas-based cybersecurity technology company CrowdStrike for Windows hosts, which caused Windows computers and tablets to crash and show a blue screen error. According to the company, more than half of Fortune 500 companies rely on its software, illustrating the far reach the outage has. The company claims that it has already identified the issue and isolated it, and a fix has been deployed. However, it could take quite some time for corrective action to be implemented. They report that Linux and Mac hosts were not impacted by the glitch. They insist it was not caused by a cyberattack or security incident, and even if that is the case, this incident demonstrates just how devastating a deliberate attack of this nature could be. Experts believe that it could take weeks for things to return to normal, even as some services start to slowly return online. This incident is a huge wake-up call for the world, demonstrating the serious risks involved in entrusting so many of our operations to technology. While there are many ways in which technology can make our lives easier, this underscores the need for a strong disaster recovery plan to prevent future outages from having such a widespread and potentially dangerous impact.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-biopsy-specialists-japan-covid-vaccines-heart-failure.html,Biopsy specialists from Japan confirm COVID jabs cause deadly heart failure,"A team of Japanese researchers successfully employed a specialized biopsy technique to prove that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" destroy the human heart . Dr. Hiroyuki Yamamoto from the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Narita-Tomisato Tokushukai Hospital in Chiba, Japan, led the following team of people in determining the cause behind the global spike in cardiac deaths that occurred after Operation Warp Speed was launched: Katsuya Hashimoto, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Narita-Tomisato Tokushukai Hospital, Chiba, Japan. Yoshihiko Ikeda, Department of Pathology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Japan. Jun Isogai, Department of Radiology, Asahi General Hospital, Asahi, Japan. Toru Hashimoto, Katsuya Hashimoto, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Narita-Tomisato Tokushukai Hospital, Chiba, Japan. This powerful team of scientific experts produced evidence showing that COVID injections cause vaccine-induced myocarditis, also known as VAM. If left untreated, VAM can kill a person. The problem is that diagnosing VAM is difficult. The condition is compared to a ticking time bomb that only makes its presence known after a potentially deadly heart attack. (Related: A recent study found that 70 percent of Pfizer COVID jab deaths in Japan were reported within 10 days of injection.) Vaccine-induced myocarditis (VAM) a ticking time bomb In a paper they published in the journal ESC Heart Failure , Yamamoto and his team explained why VAM is difficult to diagnose early. Minor focal myocarditis, multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, and fulminant myocarditis are among the many phenotypes and pathophysiology associated with VAM that further complicate trying to identify and deal with it early. Yamamoto and his team admit that there is still so much that science does not know about how COVID injections, and especially the mRNA (modRNA) variety, cause such serious problems in the heart. They write that ""histological evaluation remains to be fully understood."" In their paper, Yamamoto and his team feature the case report of a 78-year-old formerly healthy female athlete who was referred to her family physician after developing dyspnea just 11 days after taking a third COVID shot, Moderna's mRNA-1273 ""booster."" Before getting vaccinated with Moderna's COVID-19 booster, the woman took the two-dose primary series of BNT162b2 from Pfizer and BioNTech. For days after getting jabbed with Moderna, the woman ""experienced palpitations and dyspnea, which gradually worsened."" She reported no recent travel history as well as a history of mild dementia, but no risk factors for coronary artery disease were uncovered. The woman basically had a clean bill of health with no contact with COVID patients and no history of alcohol, cigarette, or illicit drug use. Why, then, did her heart fail if not because of the COVID injections she received in order to ""stop the spread?"" The type of biopsy the team conducted is known as endomyocardial, the only known kind that is capable of identifying VAM. Biopsy-proven dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was identified along with a pathological diagnosis of chronic myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy (iDCM). The case outlined in the study marks the first time that iDCM was proven through biopsy in relation to heterologous mRNA-1273 ""immunization."" The female patient in question was successfully treated with corticosteroids, based on the biopsy results. In the end, her life was saved by what Yamamoto and his team learned through their experiments. Yamamoto et al. are now calling on clinicians around the world to perform endomyocardial biopsies on all patients who present with the DCM phenotype following injection for COVID, especially in patients that got injected with mRNA. Another recent study published in Cell found that the surge in heart failure being reported among children is a direct cause of mRNA ""vaccination.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-emord-joins-alliance-for-natural-health-freedom.html,“FDA Dragon Slayer” attorney Jonathan Emord joins Alliance for Natural Health as general counsel to help protect Americans’ health freedom,"The Alliance for Natural Health (ANH-USA) has announced that Jonathan W. Emord will now serve as its General Counsel. This decorated constitutional lawyer has successfully challenged the FDA on numerous occasions, making him an excellent choice to help the organization pursue its goals. ANH-USA aims to protect the rights of natural health practitioners and the rights of consumers in choosing the treatments they prefer. They do important work in protecting alternative medicine, which is often unfairly derided by conventional medicine as untrustworthy and ineffective. They’ve been working to help promote the idea that a healthy lifestyle and diet and reduced exposure to harmful chemicals can go a long way toward avoiding the need for surgery and medication. Emord boasts four decades of experience protecting Americans’ health freedom, and his efforts will include using the recent overturning of the Chevron doctrine by the Supreme Court to protect natural health access. In a press release, ANH-USA noted that Emord has had more victories over the FDA in federal court on constitutional grounds than any other attorney in history. He is also an author and columnist who makes regular appearances on national TV and radio. “The gathering pace of globalization and centralized protection of big corporate interests, coupled with the recent overturning of the Chevron doctrine, point to this being a critical time for concerted action to protect health freedom and related rights,” the organization stated. ANH-USA has carried out numerous successful initiatives to protect Americans' health They’ve already accomplished some very impressive feats, defeating hundreds of bills throughout the nation that would eliminate or restrict vaccine exemptions or implement unreasonable mandates. They also developed a popular full-length documentary about the risky HPV vaccine, a topic that the mainstream media is unwilling to cover. They’ve defeated several efforts by lawmakers to restrict people’s access to supplements, and they’ve also made inroads in ensuring access to affordable CBD supplements. Their efforts to improve price transparency at hospitals led to an administrative rule that requires all hospitals to post a list of their standard charges online, and they’ve also helped consumers by calling for better warning labels on risky medications. One of ANH-USA’s recent efforts is a campaign to protect probiotics from the FDA’s efforts to axe them via New Dietary Ingredients guidance that uses broad language that could keep these products off the market and raise costs for consumers who want to protect their health naturally. These supplements support the growth of beneficial microorganisms and “good” bacteria, and it’s not surprising that the healthcare industry would feel threatened by their potential to prevent diseases that bring in a lot of profits via medication and surgery. They also carry out important work in warning Americans about the many dangers in our environment, from pesticides to PFAS and other endocrine disruptors. Emord, who is also known as the “FDA Dragon Slayer,” is now in a prime position to help the alliance protect our freedoms and rights at a crucial time, when the government is increasingly taking steps that threaten our health freedom and our access to natural health remedies. Praising ANH-USA’s Executive and Scientific Director Dr. Robert Verkerk, Emord stated: “Under Dr. Verkerk’s leadership, ANH will litigate in the post-Chevron era to break down regulatory barriers that violate freedom of speech, deprive Americans of due process, and impose arbitrary and capricious barriers on access to information, products and services.” "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-john-deere-abandons-dei-policies-conservative-backlash.html,John Deere abandons WOKE DEI corporate policies following backlash from conservative activists,"Prominent farm and landscaping vehicle company John Deere has abandoned most of its ""woke"" corporate activities after conservative backlash. On July 9, conservative filmmaker Robby Starbuck exposed John Deere's engagement with LGBT activists by recognizing ""preferred pronouns,"" providing gender identity training and sponsoring a ""pride"" event for children as young as three in a video posted on X. Starbuck also pointed out John Deere's total commitment"" to the ""diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) framework. (Related: John Deere goes woke, sponsors LGBT Pride event for kids as young as 3 .) Starbuck urged his fans, especially customers and employees of John Deere, to speak out if they believed John Deere's values didn't align with theirs. He provided the company's email and corporate customer service number for those who wanted to voice out their displeasure. As a response to this backlash, John Deere stressed its commitment to listening to feedback from its customers, employees and other key stakeholders on July 16. ""To best serve our customers and employees, Deere is always listening to feedback and looking for opportunities to improve,"" the company said in its official statement. ""That’s why we consistently prioritize internal policies that more closely align our business strategy to meet the needs of our customers."" The company assured the public of discontinuing participation in or support for external social or cultural awareness parades , festivals or events; refocusing Business Resource Groups on professional development, networking, mentoring and talent recruitment efforts exclusively; conducting a company-wide audit to ensure the absence of socially motivated messages in all company-mandated training materials and policies; reaffirming that diversity quotas and pronoun identification are not and have never been company policy. However, John Deere reiterated its belief in the value of a diverse workforce. ""We fundamentally believe that a diverse workforce enables us to best meet our customers' needs and because of that we will continue to track and advance the diversity of our organization."" 1792 Exchange exposes more corporations with ""woke"" policies John Deere's case is not isolated. A nonprofit organization called the 1792 Exchange, which focuses on the dangers of ESG policies, launched a project to raise awareness about corporations that have adopted practices hostile to conservative customers and employees in 2023 . The group's latest Spotlight Report reviews the policies, practices, and other relevant criteria of over 1,000 companies to assess their likelihood of ""canceling a contract or client, or boycotting, divesting or denying services based on views or beliefs."" The report identifies 147 companies as ""high risk,"" with Justin Haskins, director of the Heartland Institute's Socialism Research Center, spotlighting 51 egregious examples on Fox News. He pointed out that numerous large banks are using their financial power to push business customers into adopting climate change policies, even when it necessitates significant changes to their business practices. Specifically, he noted that Bank of America evaluates its vendors based on their commitment to LGBTQ views and has ceased lending to some gun manufacturers. Additionally, the bank has provided funding to Planned Parenthood and the Southern Poverty Law Center, organizations known for their progressive stances. Transportation companies have not been exempt from scrutiny. The 1792 Exchange identified five large transportation companies – Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and XPO Logistics – as high risk. For instance, American Airlines publicly opposed the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, and Southwest Airlines fought against state laws aimed at enhancing election integrity by limiting practices like mail-in balloting. Retail giants have also come under the spotlight. Amazon, Best Buy, Chewy, eBay, Etsy, Home Depot, Kohl's, Macy's, Shopify, Target and Walmart are all categorized as high-risk. Examples from the report include Home Depot distributing flyers to employees about confronting various forms of privilege and Target removing books objected to by left-wing activists. This project seeks to steer public companies in the United States back to a neutral stance on ideological issues, thereby best serving their shareholders and customers with integrity.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-23-infectious-polio-virus-found-in-gaza-sewage.html,"POLIO virus found in Gaza sewage, claim health authorities","The Gaza Health Ministry revealed that variant type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV) was present in sewage water samples from different collection sites in two sub-regions devastated by Israeli military offensives. The tests were carried out in cooperation with the United Nations Children's Fund. The said findings may inflict a potential health disaster as the risk of contracting the highly infectious disease can cause deformities and paralysis, and a possible spread of it across the Middle East is not far-fetched. According to the study, the poliovirus was detected in Gaza sewage samples tested in an Israeli laboratory. ""The presence of poliovirus in wastewater that collects and flows between displacement camp tents and in inhabited areas because of the destruction of infrastructure marks a new health disaster,"" the Gaza Health Ministry said, highlighting ""severe overcrowding"" and ""scarce water"" as major causes of sewage contamination and the accumulation of rubbish. World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Christian Lindmeier also released a statement claiming the same findings at six sewage systems locations in the enclave. Lindmeier called the finding ""extremely worrying."" Polio is a fecal-oral disease and infections can be linked to contaminated and poor sewage systems. Authorities in the Deir el-Balah also predicted that roads would be flooded by wastewater and ""diseases will spread"" after it turned off sewage water pumping and treatment stations. ""We are talking about a very grim medical reality ,"" said Al Jazeera 's Tareq Abu Azzoum, who was reporting from the Gazan city. Israel's refusal to let hygiene supplies into Gaza by blocking borders and controlling passageways of humanitarian assistance was to be blamed. The halt of delivery of supplies brings forth ""a suitable environment for the spread of different diseases."" ""The detection of poliovirus in wastewater threatens a real health disaster and places thousands of people at risk of contracting polio,"" the Health Ministry added. Pediatric intensive care physician Tanya Haj-Hassan said that if a person has polio, he/she has to be isolated and make sure that nobody else uses the bathroom and that the patient is not close to other people. But in Gaza's case, ""that is impossible,"" she said. ""You have everybody clustering in refugee camps at the moment without vaccines for at least the past nine months, including children who would otherwise have been vaccinated for polio and adults who, in the setting of an outbreak, should receive a booster, including healthcare workers,"" she added. She further warned that the spread of the disease among healthcare workers would be catastrophic as the current healthcare system already was ""annihilated by direct targeting, by abductions of healthcare workers, by the killing of healthcare workers."" Israeli troops to receive polio shots, reports reveal Meanwhile, the Israeli Ministry of Health earlier claimed it had evidence of a virus found in sewage samples. The ministry instructed the Israeli army to vaccinate all troops in the Gaza Strip as well as those who are about to enter and recommended a booster for those already vaccinated. ""The decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is concerned about the prospect of a polio outbreak given the sanitary situation in Gaza so it has launched a polio vaccination campaign for its soldiers in Gaza after the virus was detected in the enclave's sewage system. The vaccination campaign, which is on a voluntary basis, covers all forces in regular service in the Gaza Strip and reserves, the Times of Israel reported. (Related: Polio vaccines are the problem, not the solution .) ""The IDF will work in coordination with the Health Ministry to ensure the health of IDF soldiers and the public, and will continue to carry out inspections in the Gaza Strip,"" a spokesperson said. IDF soldiers were also instructed to take preventive actions and maintain personal hygiene. The IDF is also reportedly working with international organizations to bring more vaccines into the beleaguered enclave.

Jared Polis is spreading fear by declaring an ""emergency disaster"" in response to reports about the alleged spread of highly pathogenic bird flu in northeastern Weld County. Polis ""verbally"" declared the disaster after ""an avian flu outbreak in a commercial poultry facility in Weld County,"" reads an official statement from Polis' office on July 8. The statement does not name the facility that was allegedly impacted by H5N1. The emergency disaster declaration allows Polis and his regime to use emergency powers to ""take all necessary and appropriate state actions to assist with response, recovery, and mitigation efforts."" The Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) confirmed that 1.78 million chickens were ""impacted"" by the bird flu strain, which of course means that the food fowl were slaughtered to keep everyone ""safe."" On July 3, CDA announced that a dairy worker in northeastern Colorado supposedly became infected with H5N1 after having ""direct exposure"" to cattle supposedly sick with the virus. The worker's only symptom was mild conjunctivitis, also known as ""pink eye."" ""He has recovered,"" the agency said in a follow-up statement about the worker. ""This case is an employee at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado who had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. To protect patient privacy, additional details are not being provided."" (Related: Did you know that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $9.5 million to UW-Madison to make H5N1 bird flu transmissible from animals to humans?) Bird flu: the new COVID Early on, it seemed as though the powers that be (TPTB) were going to try to hawk up monkeypox, also known as mpox, as the new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic."" Since monkeypox is primarily an LGBT disease, it seems they switched to H5N1 instead. H5N1 has ""not adapted to spread from person to person,"" the establishment still claims. However, H5N1 can supposedly now transfer from animals to humans, which is why (or so they say) government bureaucrats are slaughtering food animals like chickens with haste. ""Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,"" said Colorado state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy. Already, we are hearing calls for people exposed to animals, i.e., farm workers, to slap on a mask, wear eye protection and gloves, and live in fear that they might catch a bird flu virus from their flocks and herds. Over the past month, Colorado reported that about two dozen commercial dairy herds were impacted by H5N1, this after no cases being reported all throughout 2023. In 2022, eight commercial poultry flocks are said to have been impacted by H5N1. So far in 2024, three dairy workers in multiple states, including Texas and Michigan, are said to have become infected with bird flu, this after one became infected in Colorado back in 2022. Two of the cases resulted in pink eye while one saw a cough, eye discomfort and a ""watery discharge."" Michigan, like Colorado, is trying to scare its residents about bird flu. Another prominent dairy state, Michigan has allegedly seen 26 herds affected by H5N1. Authorities there are urging farms not to share equipment and to also take other mitigatory measures, i.e., masking, to keep farm workers ""safe."" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is using the opportunity to tout the allege merits of milk pasteurization, which the federal agency says is ""effective at inactivating [the virus]."" ""In each of the total of nine repeated (pasteurization) experiments, the virus was completely inactivated,"" the agency added. Looks like another manufactured ""outbreak"" that will soon turn into another ""pandemic"" to oppress the world. Find out more at Outbreak.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-22-former-cdc-chief-admits-vaccine-mandates-greatest-mistakes.html,Former CDC chief admits that vaccine mandates were “one of the greatest mistakes”,"In a recent Senate hearing, the former director for the Centers for Disease Control, (CDC) Robert Redfield, made startling admissions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the unlawful mandates. Redfield, who led the CDC from 2018 to 2021, was on the original Federal Coronavirus Task Force assembled by then Vice President Mike Pence. After going along with the narrative in 2020 and 2021, Redfield has changed direction. Redfield now admits that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are ""toxic"" and criticizes the unlawful mandates and coercion that were designed to maximize uptake. Redfield looks back now and calls the mandates ""one of the greatest mistakes."" These statements came during a session of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , which focused on high-risk, gain-of-function research that has propped up a predatory and experimental vaccine industry. Dr. Robert Redfield changes direction on COVID-19 vaccines and unlawful mandates Redfield's latest remarks challenge the prevailing narrative on vaccine safety, highlighting concerns over adverse effects and the lack of transparency surrounding their risks. He expressed regret over the mandates, advocating instead for personal choice for all vaccination decisions. His change of heart contrasts sharply with the CDC, which strongly promoted mRNA vaccines as “safe and effective” during his tenure -- a fallacy that continues under the current CDC, headed by Mandy Cohen, a Biden appointee . Since Cohen took over the CDC, she has been pushing for annual covid shots , while upholding the fraudulent narrative that the jabs are safe and effective. During the Senate hearing, Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pressed Redfield on vaccine safety data, citing figures from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, (VAERS) documenting thousands of reported deaths after COVID-19 vaccination . Dr. Redfield acknowledged that the government health and regulatory agencies were not forthcoming about the millions of vaccine injury reports. He said the government agencies ignored vaccine injuries just to maintain vaccine uptake and public trust in science. But this level of force and deception has nothing to do with science. It’s great to see a former CDC chief admit that, and point out that the government is wrong about vaccine mandates, which demanded obedience at the sake of one’s individual health and dignity. Redfield knows that gain-of-function research is for exploiting populations with testing and vaccine programs Further into the inquiry, Redfield called for a halt to gain-of-function research, describing it as a significant biosecurity threat. Gain-of-function research involves enhancing the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens. Redfield emphasized the need for rigorous oversight to prevent future pandemics which are designed to unleash predatory vaccine and testing programs. Gain-of-function is the unethical research field used to develop bioweapons, PCR and antigen testing programs and profitable vaccine platforms. Redfield knows all about this, and he needs to be more precise explaining the real planning that goes into these “pandemics” and how they are weaponized to exploit populations with testing programs and the false hope of deadly vaccine experiments . The criticism of government policies extended beyond vaccine safety, and dealt directly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) deceptive use of the data and their lack of transparency on all the issues that ultimate undermined the public’s trust in government institutions. While it may be too little, too late, Redfield called for the immediate release of all safety information to help restore public trust in health agencies. Thankfully, Senators across party lines expressed support for increased oversight of high-risk gain-of-function research and biosecurity measures, echoing Redfield's calls for a dedicated agency to address emerging biological threats. The hearing concluded with calls for accountability and transparency to safeguard public health and national security in the face of future pandemics.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-22-trump-has-been-skeptic-of-childhood-vaccines.html,"Trump has long been a skeptic of childhood vaccines, leaked video with RFK Jr. reveals","A leaked video of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talking on the phone with former President Donald Trump about the latter's skepticism of the efficacy and safety of childhood vaccines recently went viral. The footage is a little over one minute and 40 seconds long, where Kennedy is seen standing close to an American flag in a dimly lit room, holding a phone and listening to Trump on speaker. In the since-deleted footage, Trump can be heard saying, ""I agree with you, man. Something's wrong with that whole system and it's the doctors you find. Remember I said, 'I want to do small doses.'"" ""When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it's meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby… and then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I've seen it so many times,"" Trump continued. ""And then you hear that it doesn't have an impact, right? But you and I talked about that a long time ago."" Trump and Kennedy are political rivals who have occasionally criticized each other during the campaign. But the clip is said to have been recorded on July 14, a day before the two saw each other in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This stoked speculations that Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump. ""I would love you to do something,"" Trump can be heard saying. ""And I think it'll be so good for you and so big for you. And we're going to win."" Kennedy then answered: ""Yeah."" A lot of people received the news with optimism, citing a possibility that Kennedy would be a member of Trump's cabinet as soon as he assumed office. However, Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said that he was not dropping out. (Related: RFK Jr. confirms meeting with Trump but firmly denies any plans to withdraw and endorse former POTUS .) The leaked footage shows that Trump holds to a stance of skepticism about childhood vaccination that he was publicly known for before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) jabs rollout under his administration's Operation Warp Speed. Politico revealed that the said project was the brainchild of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, ""who was often at odds with the White House."" His advisory board included National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and his plan won the support of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner as well as White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Trump was criticized in 2017 for a statement he made in 2015 linking vaccines to autism: ""People that work for me, just the other day, two years old, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later, got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic."" In 2014, Trump tweeted, ""Healthy young child goes to the doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!"" Meanwhile, Kennedy is known for vehemently opposing vaccines, a stance he adopted after the mothers of vaccine-injured children implored him to look into the research linking thimerosal to neurological injuries, including autism. He founded Children's Health Defense, an organization with the stated mission of ""ending childhood health epidemics by eliminating toxic exposure,"" largely through vaccines. Kennedy apologizes to Trump for video leak Kennedy's son, Bobby Kennedy III, was the one who posted the said video. The independent presidential candidate has already apologized to Trump that the private phone call had been exposed. The younger Kennedy said he just wanted to expose Trump's ""real opinion"" on immunizations, but he immediately deleted the clip. ""When President Trump called me, I was taping with an in-house videographer . I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president,"" Kennedy tweeted on X. In posting the recording, Bobby suggested Fauci should be in prison and appeared to suggest his father should have been Trump's running mate on a ""unity ticket"" rather than ""JD 'fire all the unvaccinated nurses' Vance."" He also implied Republicans and Democrats were subordinate to Pfizer, a multinational vaccine producer. Kennedy III added: ""This is not a cheapfake or somebody doing a Trump voice. This is the real deal."" Spear claimed that the meeting in Milwaukee was to discuss national unity and that Kennedy hopes to meet with leaders of the Democratic Party as well.

Several studies have also suggested that once microplastics enter the human body, they can increase the risk of health problems such as heart attack , stroke and even death. Plastic is a crucial product in industrial production and it is pervasive in daily life. However, when plastic products break down, they turn into microplastics or nanoplastics, which are much smaller. Microplastics are plastic pieces smaller than five millimeters, while nanoplastics measure below one micron (1,000 nanometers). According to Lin Xiaoxu, a virus specialist with a doctorate in microbiology, everyday plastic products ""release"" microplastics. Even synthetic textiles shed fiber fragments, and worn-out tires release plastic-containing dust. Smooth plastic water bottles can also shed microplastics during washing. When these bottles are left out in nature, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation continuously break down the plastics into smaller particles, further contributing to microplastic pollution. (Related: STUDY: Microplastics in the body may aggravate cancer and spur metastasis .) The following items also contribute to microplastic pollution: Bags Bottles Fishing nets Hygiene products Particles emitted from factories Textiles Tire dust Unfortunately, humans and some animals often ingest some of these particles and other plastic particles accumulate and break down in oceans and soils. Marine organisms such as small fish, shellfish and shrimp, particularly those near coastlines, are more like to ingest harmful microplastics. Lin explained that the main sources of microplastics are industrial waste and wastewater discharge, which can cause significant environmental damage if left untreated. Before the wastewater is released from factories, it must undergo thorough processes like biological reactions, chlorination, membrane technology, sand removal, sedimentation, screening and ultraviolet treatment to remove more than 90 percent of microplastics. But complete elimination is not achievable even with modern technology and natural environments may take thousands to tens of thousands of years to fully degrade microplastics. Health risks linked to microplastics Microplastics usually enter the body through food and drink ingestion. On the other hand, nanoplastics can be inhaled. Aside from directly irritating mucous membranes, microplastics can carry environmental microbes like bacteria and viruses into the body. Lin said once people ingest something toxic, they will often say it can be washed out quickly. However, microplastics are very tiny particles that ""adhere to the surface of the stomach."" He warned that there is no guarantee that washing out microplastics will remove them. He added that the body needs to slowly eliminate them, but this increases ""the burden on the body."" Several studies have revealed that after exposure to ultraviolet light and microbial degradation in the natural environment, ""microplastics become more adsorbent, forming complexes with various environmental pollutants on their surfaces, making them more toxic to organisms."" Microplastics, which function as carriers for dangerous heavy metals and pathogens, exhibit various toxicities upon entering the body. And while most microplastics ingested through food are excreted via feces, a small portion can remain in the intestines for several days. This can result in inflammation, intestinal damage and the disruption of gut microbiota. Microplastics can eventually be absorbed into intestinal cells and enter the bloodstream, which can damage organs and systems throughout the body. Organs like the liver and kidneys and bodily systems such as the immune, nervous and reproductive systems are often affected. The excessive inhalation of microplastics can also result in respiratory tissue damage and disease. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , most carotid artery plaques contain microplastics . While conducting the study, researchers worked with 257 patients aged 18 to 75 with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Researchers detected polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride in the removed carotid artery plaques of 150 patients (58.4 percent) and 31 patients (12.1 percent), respectively. The research team reported that macrophages within the plaques contained visible foreign particles, some with jagged edges and chlorine content. They added that the patients with detected microplastics had over 4.5 times higher risk of heart attacks, strokes or death compared to the patients without microplastics.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-22-former-fda-head-merck-fraud-mumps-vaccine.html,"Former FDA head accuses Merck of FRAUD over testing, marketing of mumps vaccine","Dr. David Kessler, who used to head up the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a time, released a report recently that exposes Merck & Co. for misrepresenting the efficacy of its mumps vaccine and marketing the ""adulterated"" drug without proven efficacy to millions of American children. The report was released as two separate documents, this one and this one , and is marked ""highly confidential"" and ""for attorney's eyes only."" The more than 800 pages contained in the report outline Kessler's opinion and analysis of both the history and severity of Merck's many regulatory violations over the years, beginning around the late 1990s. At issue is Merck's infamous measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, also known as MMRII. Kessler reveals with proof how by the year 1998, a regulatory labeling review found that the mumps component of MMRII did not maintain its stated potency over its shelf life, which violates the regulations set forth by the FDA. Merck should have recalled the adulterated and violative multivalent vaccine immediately, but instead spent years trying to come up with alternative testing methods that would produce the positive results the company wanted. This is known as fraud , and it is a hallmark of the way Merck has been operating with regard to MMRII. (Related: Did you know that mumps is mostly spread by children who are vaccinated?) The FDA was complicit in Merck's MMRII fraud Merck knew all along, says Kessler, that its own internal data showed that MMRII was significantly less effective than claimed. Still, the company tried to tweak the truth rather than come up with a new formulation that met the stated efficacy while complying with FDA guidelines. Merck did successfully come up with a temporary fix to the problem that involved increasing the dosage of the virus present within the vaccine. The FDA knew Merck did this and allowed it even though the higher dosage was never tested in clinical trials for safety or efficacy. At no point in time did either Merck or the FDA notify vaccine recipients, providers or purchasers, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which purchased the drug via its Vaccines for Children Program, that anything had changed with the vaccine's formulation, or that it was in breach of FDA compliance. Kessler wrote in his report that Merck's actions on this matter came with ""public health significance"" in that starting in 2006 and beyond there was a major resurgence in mumps outbreaks across the United States, the largest occurring in 2017 when more than 10,000 people across 46 states succumbed to the infection. As is almost always the case with such outbreaks, the vast majority of those who got sick with mumps had previously gotten the recommended two-dose injection series of Merck's MMR vaccine. ""In my opinion, with regard to children immunized in the United States with vaccines manufactured from 1998-2007, no one can determine which of the children, who are now young adults, were immunized from the lots of MMRII for which Merck did not have adequate assurances of the potency,"" Kessler says. Kessler's report was made public as part of the Krahling et al. v. Merck and Co. Inc trial, which saw oral arguments presented in the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia on July 9. Former Merck virologists Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski achieved whistleblower status after they came forward in the 2000s to blow the lid on how Merck's upper management tried to get them to falsify data in company tests to keep the ruse going for as long as possible. Corporate corruption is rampant in the United States, including at Merck. Find out more at Corruption.news . "
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-22-processed-foods-toxic-substances-not-listed-ingredients.html,Many processed foods contain potentially toxic substances NOT LISTED on ingredient labels,"You are probably familiar with many of the no-no ingredients in processed foods that are to be avoided at all costs (i.e., synthetic dyes and preservatives), but what about the ""invisible"" additives that are hiding in foods unlabeled ? Known as ""processing aids,"" these hidden additives are not labeled because technically they are not part of the food product itself, but are rather residues left over from the food production process. Common processing aids include additives that ""soak and wash"" certain ingredients, ""filter"" beverages like wine and juice to make them appear clearer, and improve the texture of bread products to make them softer and more elastic, among other uses. ""During the production process, these aids are consumed, transformed, or removed, rendering them virtually undetectable in the final product,"" warns Flora Zhao from The Epoch Times about the hidden presence of processing aids in processed foods. In fruit juice, for example, some manufacturers will add enzymes to the juice extraction to produce yields upwards of 90 percent of the fruit's weight. When heated for a few hours in juice, enzymes like pectinase and amylase liquefy the final product by breaking down cellulase and polysaccharides such as pectin, and more juice and sugars. ""These enzymes improve the flow of the juice in processing containers and enhance its sweetness,"" Zhao explains. ""They are consumed and transformed during processing, ultimately not appearing on the ingredient label."" Another processed food containing hidden processing aids is ""lactose-free"" milk, which contains added lactase to counter the damage caused by pasteurization. Raw milk contains natural enzymes that break down lactose but pasteurized milk does not, which is why many people cannot drink it due to ""lactose intolerance."" ""Additionally, applying palm wax to baking molds aids in easy cake release,"" Zhao says. ""Bottled sauces often have nitrogen added during bottling to displace oxygen, preventing oxidation and product spoilage."" (Related: Did you know that global food policy is controlled by a handful of multinational corporate food giants that include Coca-Cola, Nestlé and PepsiCo?) Processing aids aren't necessarily safe for consumption So, what exactly are processing aids in official terms? They go by names like clarifying agents, clouding agents, catalysts, flocculants, filter acids and crystallization inhibitors. Their purposes are many, but suffice it to say that processing aids maximize shelf life and ultimately profits for food corporations. Martin Bucknavage, a senior food safety specialist at Penn State University 's Department of Food Science , says there are no risks involved with consuming hidden processing aids in foods, but food process engineer Tim Bowser from Oklahoma State University 's Robert M. Kerr Food and Agricultural Products Center says otherwise. ""There [are] risks in all processes,"" Bowser warns. ""There [are] definitely potential side effects and negative aspects that need to be looked into."" The silver lining in all this is that, according to Bowser, food producers are unlikely to use processing aids for deception and adulteration purposes because of the way they function. ""They do not have that ability to cheat,"" Bowser says. ""The residuals would be too low to detect."" On the flip side, detection technology is always advancing, so there could come a time when processing aids are able to be detected at the parts per billion (ppb) or even parts per trillion (ppt) level. Beer is another food product that often contains hidden processing aids, even in places like Germany where they are prohibited. Diatomaceous earth, which is used to filter alcohol and beverages in general, is believed to sometimes be contaminated with arsenic, which could explain why German beers are seeing a gradual increase in its concentration in the final product. ""The use of certain processing aids can increase levels of contaminants in beverages,"" a spokesperson from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-22-ardis-people-should-not-worry-bird-flu.html,Dr. Bryan Ardis: People shouldn’t be worried about the BIRD FLU SCARE,"Retired chiropractor Dr. Bryan Ardis says people should not be worried about the bird flu scare . During a recent episode of his podcast ""The Dr. Ardis Show,"" he explained how the bird flu scare is one absurdity after another. He also shared an article by NBC News about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) possibly finding the bird flu virus in a handful of wastewater sites . Ardis recalled his documentary ""Watch the Water"" that discussed the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) possibly being in the water systems and making Americans sick. This report, he added, only makes Americans aware that the CDC is doing something with the city wastewater. The retired chiropractor told his audience: ""There's a big problem with this. The bird flu virus is only a respiratory virus. You have to inhale it in order to get sick. ""Why are they looking in your wastewater when you don't inhale wastewater as a threat to you getting sick? The only way bird flu would end up in the wastewater that you flush down the toilet is if you coughed into the toilet and then flushed it. ""They are not there looking for the bird flu in your wastewater. They are there putting poison in your water, and they are making you sick with it – with an illusion that they are there to test for safety measurements. How much bird flu is coming out of your city? No, that's not what they are doing."" According to Ardis, symptoms of bird flu include fever, sore throat, cough, stuffy or runny nose, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, shortness of breath and pink eye. But he noted that every one of those symptoms can actually be a symptom of every virus known on Earth. He also warned that bird flu drugs like Tamiflu, Rapivab and Relenza are showing the same symptoms of the bird flu as side effects. Ardis: Sea animals having bird flu is absurd According to the host of ""The Dr. Ardis Show,"" the Type A H5N1 strain of bird flu was first discovered in 1959. Recent news report claim that since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species such as dogs, cats, skunks and bears. Even sea animals such as seals and porpoises are testing positive for bird flu. However, Ardis remarked that animals in the ocean such as seals and porpoises having bird flu is absurd. He continued that this is one suggestion nobody should fall for. ""They're going to kill all kinds of people, all kinds of animals, and they're going to tell you they had the bird flu and they had to be killed in order to stop the outbreak. That's ridiculous and not true. They use that as fear porn to scare the crap out of you at home while you watch all these chickens having to be slaughtered because they couldn't get rid of the bird flu,"" he said. He took note that if bird flu was so deadly, the chickens would die anyway – eliminating the need to cull them. He explained: ""Why just isolate them somewhere in a big cage. Let them all die from the bird flu? The truth is they wouldn't die, any of them – and then there would be nothing to sell you as far as a drug or vaccine."" (Related: FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN TAKEDOWN: Over 4 million chickens to be slaughtered after bird flu detected at egg farm .) Ardis also mentioned that amid the bird flu fearmongering, there have been only two cases of bird flu in the U.S. – and neither were fatal. He stressed that despite announcements on various news outlets about a ""looming pandemic,"" there is no reason for Americans to be afraid of bird flu.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-19-obesity-doubles-food-companies-health-any-size.html,Obesity rate doubles as food companies fatten up Americans like cows with “health at any size” propaganda campaign,"To keep Americans gobbling down their chemical-laced, genetically modified (GMO) poisons with glee, processed food giants like General Mills are pushing a ""health at any size"" narrative that presents obesity and chronic illness as trendy and ""woke."" The goal is to convince as many Americans as possible that being fat and sick is completely normal, all so they continue buying sugar- and preservative-filled feed slop that fattens them up like cows for slaughter. Jaye Rochon learned this the hard way after she bought the ""health at any size"" mantra and quickly gained 50 pounds. Rochon was already overweight to begin with, so that extra 50 pounds brought her up to a very unhealthy 300 pounds. Rochon fell for the lies being peddled by General Mills that ""anti-dieting"" is a scientifically proven strategy to get and stay healthy at any weight. The 51-year-old video editor from Wausau, Wisc., now knows that the food industry's ""anti-diet research"" is a total sham, as is the idea that ""food shaming"" causes harm. ""They made me feel like I was safe eating whatever the hell I wanted,"" Rochon told The Washington Post , which ran a profile on her and her story. (Related: Learn more about how the Obesity Industrial Complex pushes junk food on children from an early age so they grow up to be fat, sluggish pharmaceutical junkies.) Nestlé also pays dietitians to shove unhealthy junk food in people's faces In the case of General Mills, the company showers registered dietitians with cash and gifts in exchange for their support of the #DerailTheShame social media movement, which is similar to the pro-drugs movement behind Big Pharma. Just like how the pharmaceutical industry showers doctors with cash, fancy dinners and vacations, and gifts for pushing pharmaceuticals and vaccines on their patients, General Mills is essentially bribing dietitians to promote junk food to their patients. General Mills sponsors social media ""influencers"" whose job it is to influence the gullible. The company also pays a sizable team of lobbyists to push back against federal policies that aim to clean up the food supply and promote real health through non-obesity. ""You can help derail the cycle of shame,"" said Amy Cohn, General Mills' senior manager for nutrition and external affairs, in an anti-diet diatribe she delivered at a national food conference last fall. ""People need to feel heard and seen to break the cycle of shame around weight loss and eating,"" tweeted Kathryn Lawson, a dietitian who works at Nestlé, during the conference at which Cohn spoke. An analysis of 6,000 social media posts shared by 68 dietitians with more than 10,000 followers found that about 40 percent of them use this same anti-diet language, the vast majority of them taking money from food, beverage and supplement companies. All in all, these propagandists have reached around nine million people with their propaganda. In 2023, no fewer than 10 dietitians promoted General Mills cereals on TikTok and Instagram using the hashtag #DerailTheShame. Many of the posts depicted personalized Cheerios boxes, Cheerios being one of General Mills' most iconic cereal brands. Last November, an ""anti-diet"" dietitian named Cara Harbstreet promoted Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Trix on her TikTok account, advocating for ""fearlessly nourishing meals, including cereal."" In Harbstreet's case, she at least included the hashtag #sponsored to indicate that she was paid to be cringe. ""Americans are being poisoned and turned into a bunch of fat, gay retards,"" one commenter wrote. ""Obesity is increasing. IQs are decreasing. Fertility is decreasing. Mortality is increasing.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-19-president-wont-bow-democrat-elites-want-him-out.html,Biden’s CEO ally: The president won’t bow down to Democrat elites who want him out of the race,"A top company executive, who is a loyal ally of President Joe Biden, is standing by his side as he insisted that Biden said that there is ""no way he is dropping out of the race,"" that he ""hates"" the party elite , and that he will tell them all to ""f#@k off."" A growing number of Democrats as well as election mega-donors have expressed concern about Biden's performance in the first presidential debate, which has been compounded by numerous gaffes and blunders in the following days, pushing them to call for the POTUS' withdrawal in the election race to give way to a younger candidate. Senior contributor to Fox Business and columnist for the New York Post Charles Gasparino reported that the CEO, who knows Biden closely, said that the president will stay in the race and that he will not bow down to party elites. ""No f**king way he's dropping out,"" the friend reportedly said. He added that Biden could not care less what the elite in his party or the fundraisers think. He claimed that the POTUS ""really hates them and he'll take their money but he knows they look down on him as some rube."" ""Plus he thinks he earned the presidency after trying so many times and there's no way he's giving it up to go down in history as a loser who dropped out because he isn't tough enough. He only cares about his wife and family and he will tell everyone else to f*#ck off,"" the friend concluded. The 81-year-old commander-in-chief has also publicly declared he is ""not going anywhere"" and at the NATO summit last week, offered a lengthy and mostly steady rebuttal to his detractors. Following the CNN debate on June 27, Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, said that it was time for Biden to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw "" as he called for him to drop the race. He said he respected ""all that President Biden has achieved"" but that the Democrat had failed to ""effectively defend his many accomplishments"" on the debate stage. He has since been joined by other House of Representatives colleagues, including Arizona left-winger Raul Grijalva who told the New York Times that Biden had to now ""shoulder the responsibility"" of holding the White House as well as Massachusetts' Seth Moulton who told WBUR that he no longer had confidence that Biden could beat Trump. Illinois congressman Mike Quigley also made a direct plea to the president on MSNBC , saying that his ""legacy is set"" but it was time to ""let someone else do this."" They were also joined by Angie Craig, a Minnesota Democrat who fretted over Biden's ""lack of a forceful response"" during the debate. Also, Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said Biden could no longer ""clearly, articulately, and strongly make his case to the American people."" Several others share the same sentiments. Even actor/Democrat activist George Clooney expressed his concern by penning an op-ed for the New York Times calling for the president to step down, despite having hosted a fundraiser for him several weeks ago. ""It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,"" Clooney revealed. ""Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign."" (Related: George Clooney the latest influential figure to call on Biden to step aside and urge Democrats to choose a new nominee .) Obama, Pelosi refuse to express concerns over Biden in public In a recent article published by CNN , it was claimed that former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Biden and their concerns about how much harder they think it has become for the president to beat Donald Trump. Neither is allegedly quite sure what to do. Many of Pelosi's colleagues see her as their only hope in bringing an end to the turmoil that has involved Democrats for the last two weeks. Several of them even believe that the end can come if and when she tells Biden that he has to drop out. Pelosi has spoken to Biden since the debate, but in the time since, she has made clear that she does not see Biden's decision to stay in the race as final. Meanwhile, several leading party members felt being left in the middle as Obama continued to stay mum and not make any public comment for the last weeks. After the debate, the former president posted on X, ""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,"" reiterating that sentiment at a fundraiser in New York for House Democrats the night after Biden's performance. According to the news outlet, the former president had not even planned to make any public statement, but Biden and Obama's aides coordinated to get that post out in a way that reflected Biden's campaign talking points that Obama's first reelection debate in 2012 went badly, too, and it didn't end up ending his campaign.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-19-musk-moves-x-spacex-texas-california-trans-law.html,"LAST STRAW: Elon Musk to move X and SpaceX to Texas following California’s passage of new pro-trans, pro-pedo law","Billionaire Elon Musk will move the operations of X and SpaceX out of California and into Texas after Gov. Gavin Newsom declared he has signed into law a bill – Assembly Bill 1955 – prohibiting schools from enforcing rules that will inform parents if a child identifies as transgender. ""This is the final straw,"" Musk said in a post on X , the social media platform he bought in 2022. ""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."" The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla then added that "" X HQ will move to Austin "" from San Francisco and that he's ""had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building."" Musk further said in a separate post: ""I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children."" (Related: Musk slams expensive California school for infecting his transgender son with ""woke mind virus."" ) A.B. 1955 expressly prohibits California school districts from informing the parents of students if their children start self-identifying as transgender, such as by using pronouns that differ from their biological sex or asking to be referred to with different names. Schools will only be allowed to inform parents if they have the permission of students. The law also overrides policies passed by local school boards that had required educators to tell parents if their children displayed signs of being transgender. Early this year, California's Democrat Attorney General Rob Bonta released a legal advisory to schools in the state warning that informing parents of their children's decision to use distinct pronouns or change their gender – without the child's permission – probably violated the state constitution. A.B. 1955 ""the final straw"" for Musk It is also extremely significant for states like California when major companies like X and SpaceX relocate, as their budgets depend on taxing established companies and their employees. California's rules have long drawn the anger of Musk. Back in 2020, Musk first stated that he had personally relocated to Texas, a move that helped spare him from California's high taxes . The following year, he moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin from Silicon Valley over frustrations about local pandemic restrictions supposedly hindering operations. In 2022, Musk's tunnel-digging corporation, the Boring Company, similarly dumped California for Texas. ""Frankly, this is the final straw,"" Musk tweeted at that time. The latest measure attracting Musk's contempt was signed into law Monday, July 15, by Newsom. Newsom refused to give a comment, but his office mentioned that California law still requires parental consent for kids to change their names and that parents also are assured of access to education records. Other Musk-owned corporations will remain in California for the time being , including xAI, Musk's startup that hopes to challenge OpenAI in the field of artificial intelligence. xAI is still based in Burlingame in the San Francisco Peninsula. His biotechnology company, Neuralink, will also for the time being remain in Fremont in the East Bay. Furthermore, while Tesla has moved much of its business base to Texas, Musk has maintained important manufacturing operations in Fremont, and just last year declared the opening of an engineering headquarters for the electric car maker in nearby Palo Alto.

The mix-up happened in a July 11 speech the 81-year-old Biden delivered during the summit. He mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ""President [Vladimir] Putin,"" the leader of Russia – which is currently at war with Zelensky's nation. Biden immediately realized his mistake, returning to the microphone to clarify that Zelensky is going to beat Putin. (Related: Biden COULDN’T RECOGNIZE familiar faces at NATO Summit, attendee claims .) Hours later at the same event, Biden mixed up the name of Vice President Kamala Harris with that of former President Donald Trump – the latter he is set to face in November. ""Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president [if I] think she was not qualified for the president,"" he remarked. Unlike the Zelensky gaffe, Biden did not seem to catch that mistake at the time. According to the South China Morning Post , the July 11 news conference was organized to show that Biden has the stamina and ability to continue a second term. ""I'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I allay fears,"" he told attendees of the NATO summit. For years, Biden has been hounded by issues that he has been suffering cognitive decline .

The mix-ups of the names of Zelensky and Harris, coupled with the dismal debate performance, fueled talks among Democrats and the MSM over Biden's status as the Democratic presidential nominee. Costa: Calls for Biden to step aside weaken after Trump assassination attempt But almost instantly after the press conference ended, three Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives joined the growing chorus of legislators calling on Biden to step aside. This included Connecticut Rep. Jim Hines, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. One unnamed member of a NATO delegation said after the press conference that their nation's leader did not believe Biden could survive the crisis gripping his presidency. The summit was nevertheless lauded by most participants for its substance. Biden's cognitive decline dominated political headlines until the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The former U.S. president narrowly missed being shot by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, but the gunman killed one audience member and critically wounded two others. The attack has since dominated the political conversation, according to LifeSiteNews . A day after the failed assassination attempt, Robert Costa of CBS News shared that those trying to pressure Biden into withdrawing from the race are ""standing down"" in the wake of the attack on Trump. ""I've been speaking with some top Democrats. They believe that those Democrats who have the concerns about President Biden are now standing down politically [and] will back President Biden because of this fragile political moment,"" he said. ""All of that talk about the debate faded almost instantly among my top Democratic sources as this unfolded. Say it's time for the country to stick together, and that means Democrats sticking together as well."" Follow JoeBiden.news for more stories about the incumbent president's reelection campaign.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-pro-jab-apologist-admits-no-vaccine-safety.html,Longtime pro-jab apologist finally comes clean about lack of science proving vaccine safety,"After decades of aggressively promoting vaccines of all kinds, Dr. Stanley Plotkin, the world's leading vaccinologist, is finally coming clean about the fact that vaccine safety has never been robustly studied as he has long claimed. A paper he co-authored that was published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on July 6, 2024, reveals that no vaccine has ever been properly studied either before or after their release. Aaron Siri tweeted a lengthy post about Plotkin's new paper in the NEJM, which admits that ""prelicensure clinical trials have limited sample sizes [and] follow-up durations,"" as well as that ""there are not resources earmarked for postauthorization safety studies."" ""That is an incredible reversal,"" Siri said before unpacking the rest of the study's damning revelations basically indicting the vaccine industry and Big Pharma for science fraud. ""For decades, the medical community insisted vaccines are the most thoroughly studied product ever; for example, Dr. Paul Offit said, 'I think we should be proud of vaccines as arguably the safest, best tested things we put in our body,'"" Siri further explained. ""For decades, parents of vaccine injured children, vaccine injured adults, and other stakeholders contested these claims only to be shunned and attacked by the medical community and health agencies."" (Related: At the 2020 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] meeting, Plotkin, often referred to as 'the godfather of vaccines,' promoted Donald Trump's COVID injections before they were even released under Operation Warp Speed.)

The rats are suddenly changing their tune In 2018, Siri personally met with Plotkin to ""depose the architecture"" of the nation's vaccination program. Siri presented undeniable evidence that there is a prolific lack of vaccine safety trials and studies, something Plotkin initially denied but now admits is true. At the time, Plotkin went on a tirade in response to Siri's evidence, demanding that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) add ""missing information on safety and efficacy"" in vaccine package inserts. Plotkin also demanded that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) exclude the list of harms from Vaccine Information Sheets. Other harm Plotkin caused at the time included: - Lobbying the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support vaccine organizations - Working to have the World Health Organization (WHO) list so-called ""vaccine hesitancy"" as a global threat - Lobbying the AAP, IDSA, and PIDS to ""support training of witnesses"" to promote the idea of vaccine safety Plotkin was on a crusade, in other words, to make vaccine safety studies a real thing even when they did not exist. Now that the entire world is turning on the COVID injections from Operation Warp Speed, suddenly Plotkin is changing is tune. ""The problem is, it doesn't work,"" Siri says. ""It doesn't work because, at bottom, there are no proper safety studies. So, there is no safety data to add to the FDA package inserts, and hiding harms by removing them from CDC inserts doesn't make them go away."" ""Parents and other adults don't simply stop believing what they have seen with their own eyes because CDC, WHO, the Gates Foundations, etc., won't acknowledge them, or worse, they attack them."" Now that Plotkin and his ""disciples,"" to quote Siri's reference to them, realize that ""they can't cast voodoo on the public"" about this critical issue, they are now trying to co-opt the truth that they have lied about for decades. ""But in making that admission, they conveniently fail to admit that for decades they lied, gaslit, defrauded (and I don't use that word lightly) the public by claiming that vaccines are probably the most thoroughly safety tested products on the planet and that people should rest assured, no stone on vaccine safety was left unturned,"" Siri says.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-ivermectin-works-against-parkinsons-depression-chronic-pain.html,"Ivermectin found to work against Parkinson’s, depression, chronic pain and more","There is a whole lot more that ivermectin can do than just prevent and treat the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). In an article posted to his Repurposed Drugs Substack, physician, writer and human rights advocate Justus R. Hope unpacked the latest science on ivermectin, which in addition to fighting viruses, bacteria and cancer also shows unique neuroprotective benefits. Citing the work of Dr. William Makis, Hope explains that ivermectin prevents P2X4 receptors from internalizing and overexpressing. P2X4 expression is a driver of many neurological diseases including dementia (i.e., Alzheimer's disease), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic neuropathic pain, depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety. If you suffer from migraines or abuse alcohol, ivermectin may help you as well due to the same P2X4 stabilization effects that provide neuroprotective benefits. Taking ivermectin could help to reduce cravings for and consumption of alcohol in those with an alcohol abuse disorder. ""If it is neuroprotective, and the evidence is growing that it is, and humanity is being bombarded with various toxins and electromagnetic frequencies each day that compromise our nervous system, perhaps there is reason to consider Ivermectin as a neuro-protective repurposed drug worthy of use during this dangerous time in our history,"" Hope contends. (Related: When taking ivermectin, be sure to also eat high-fat foods for maximum absorption.) Supplementing with ivermectin to protect against EMFs Scientific research published in the journal Neuroscience Bulletin provides further insights into the technical aspects of how P2X4 expression causes degeneration of the nervous system.

""In various pathological states, such as trauma, ischemia, chronic pain, neurodegenerative processes, and several neuropsychiatric disorders, de novo expression of P2X4 and / or an increase in cell surface P2X4 density has been reported in microglia and / or neurons, thus suggesting possible key and multiple roles of neuronal and microglial P2X4 receptors in the establishment and/or maintenance of these pathologies,"" the paper reveals. ""Changes in the intracellular expression of P2X4 may also have important consequences in the pathophysiological context."" As for the role of allosteric modulators like ivermectin in limiting the damaging effects of P2X4, this study in Frontiers in Pharmacology explains that limiting the expression of P2X4 receptors, as well as two other related proteins, P2X2 and P2X7, ""may be of therapeutic benefit in a number of different conditions ..."" There are a whole lot of other toxic things in the environment that ivermectin may also block from causing neurological harm, one of them being electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs) from things like cell phone towers, wireless routers, mobile phones, Bluetooth and more. Hope believes that a growing body of evidence points to ivermectin helping to protect the nervous system from EMF damage ""during this dangerous time in our history."" ""Ivermectin may not just be the anti-parasitic, anti-cancer, anti-viral repurposed drug we recognize but may have multiple other neuroprotective benefits for humanity in an era where we all may be subjected to neurotoxins – some apparent, and others invisible – like EMF,"" Hope writes. Aside from a few minor concerns, ivermectin is among the safest medications to ever hit the market. Unless one's body is so overloaded with parasites that he or she experiences dramatic die-off symptoms from taking it, ivermectin is generally considered to be safe in most people. ""Decades of studies on the effects of ivermectin in humans show that it is very safe,"" one commenter wrote. Another noted that ivermectin won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine for its effectiveness against certain types of parasites, scabies, lice and cancers.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-merck-defrauded-public-mmr-vaccine-safety.html,"Merck defrauded the public for over a decade, falsely advertising their MMR vaccine as “safe and effective” against staggering evidence","Much of the well-established “vaccine science” that Americans trust is really just fraudulent marketing and rigged trials put forth by the pharmaceutical companies. The 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania recently heard oral arguments for a lawsuit alleging that Merck fraudulently marketed its MMR vaccine . The most trusted medical intervention is based on decades of fraudulent advertisement, misbranding, mislabeling For decades, the medical community insisted the vaccines are the most thoroughly studied pharmaceutical product in the history of medicine. However, there are no federally funded studies comparing vaccinated populations against unvaccinated populations because scientists believe it is unethical to withhold these “lifesaving” vaccines from children. The proper double blind, saline, placebo-controlled studies do not take place because of a longstanding bias that the vaccines are necessary for human life and should not be withheld from children. This supposition disregards historical evidence of populations that were never subjected to these products but did however develop natural immunity to various infectious diseases. The scientific and medical community must take a more critical look at the safety and necessity of today’s vaccine schedule. The father of modern vaccinology himself, Dr. Stanley Plotkin, recently admitted that vaccines are not properly studied — neither pre-licensure nor post-licensure. Plotkin admitted that “prelicensure clinical trials have limited sample sizes [and] follow-up durations” and that “there are not resources earmarked for post authorization safety studies.” Human knowledge is under attack!

Merck defrauded the CDC, FDA and the general public with its ineffective and unsafe MMR vaccine For over three decades, Merck scientists have been aware that their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combination vaccine is less effective than the company proposes on its original product license and product insert. Over the years, researchers have demonstrated that Merck’s MMR vaccine loses efficacy over time. Instead of suspending sales and rendering the vaccine defective, Merck has pushed state legislatures to mandate the vaccine for schoolchildren, going as far as to lobby state reps to abolish philosophical, religious and medical exemptions to their vaccine. Merck’s own test results for the MMR vaccine did not meet the FDA’s specifications and acceptance criteria for drug applications. Instead of withdrawing the product and issuing a product recall, the FDA allowed the vaccine on the market . The CDC continued to purchase the defective vaccine while the public was unaware and misinformed of its failing efficacy and growing risk profile. By April 2012, two Merck virologists – Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski – became whistleblowers against Merck . They filed two lawsuits against their employers, alleging the company falsified research data, enabling the formation of a monopoly on the MMR vaccine. An expert witness from the FDA, ex-commissioner Dr. David A. Kessler, provided Merck’s own internal documents to show that the vaccine was “misbranded” “out of compliance” and “non-marketable.” Witnesses to the case allege that Merck scientists began “falsifying data and destroying unfavorable data” to make the MMR vaccine appear safe and effective. The whistleblowers allege that Merck defrauded the U.S. government regulatory agencies, misleading them to purchase 4 million doses of misbranded and mislabeled MMR vaccine every year for at least a decade. MMR vaccine's false sense of security putting future generations at risk Over the years, the vaccine’s lack of efficacy has given vaccinated populations a false sense of security and has led to mumps and measles outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations. Merck has known this for many years, but they have continued to deceive the public, the FDA and the CDC, destroying any shred of informed consent on the matter, and maintaining a monopoly on a product that doctors and parents have blindly trusted for decades. So far, Merck has received favorable rulings because their defense contends that the CDC continued to purchase the vaccine and the FDA did not require any changes throughout the years. However, not providing the latest data and science on the MMR vaccine constitutes a willful act of fraud on behalf of Merck. This level of fraud has deeply affected many generations of people. Some have lost loved ones to the vaccine’s adverse events and others have received little to no immunity to measles, mumps and rubella – putting them at greater risk to the target infectious diseases over time. The loss of passively acquired maternal antibodies for infants can also be traced back to the failures of the MMR vaccine . Decades of Merck's MMR vaccine fraud will have vast and potentially drastic consequences for future generations of children.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-biden-reconsider-dropping-out-doctors-medical-condition.html,Biden says he might reconsider dropping out if his doctors advise that a medical condition warrants it,"President Joe Biden has revealed that he might reconsider his bid for reelection if advised by his doctors that a medical condition warranted such a decision. In an interview with Ed Gordon of BET News on July 17, the 81-year-old president claimed that his doctors, including White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor, have found him fit to serve. In fact, O'Connor described him as a ""healthy, active, robust, 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency"" in his February physical assessment. (Related: White House in DAMAGE CONTROL mode after Biden-Trump debate as 80% of voters say incumbent is ""too old to run."" ) However, his lackluster performance in the recent CNN presidential debate with former President Donald Trump has raised massive concerns, including among Democrats, regarding his health. This, in turn, has led to increased calls from within his own party and its influential megadonors for him to step aside and give way for a new, younger nominee. Biden has so far resisted these calls. During the BET News interview, Gordon asked Biden if any circumstances might lead him to reconsider his campaign. ""If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem,"" Biden said. Biden also acknowledged his ""mistakes"" in the presidential debate and stressed that he would reconsider his decision if a medical assessment warranted it. He also revealed that he had initially intended to serve only one term but decided to run again because he believed in his ability to heal the divisions across the United States.

""You may remember, Ed, I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I would be able to move on from this and pass it on to somebody else,"" the president said. ""But I didn’t anticipate things getting so, so, so divided. And quite frankly, I think the only thing age brings is a little bit of wisdom."" His remarks suggest he had considered his 2020 campaign a bridge to a new generation of Democratic leaders, a sentiment that resonated with many at the time. Nonetheless, his political advisers have since implied that the transition period could span eight years, extending through a potential second term. ""I think I've demonstrated that I know how to get things done for the country in spite of the fact that we were told we couldn't get it done,"" he said. ""But there's more to do, and I'm reluctant to walk away from that."" Biden: Only divine intervention would compel me to drop out Previously, Biden stated in a 22-minute candid interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that only divine intervention would compel him to drop out . ""If the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that I might do that,"" Biden said. He claimed that no one else could convince him to quit the race and even blamed the flu for his underwhelming performance. At that time, Biden assured the public that there was no real cause for concern, dismissing the event as a ""bad night."" ""I was feeling terrible. As a matter of fact, the docs with me I asked if they did a COVID test, they were trying to figure out what's wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold,"" he explained. Biden also reiterated that he undergoes ""a full neurological test every day."" However, when asked whether he had consulted a neurologist or undergone an independent medical evaluation, he became evasive. During the whole time of the interview, which aired unedited, Biden attempted to underscore his qualifications. He then later mentioned he would consider stepping down if aides provided irrefutable proof that he couldn't win. ""I don't think anyone is more qualified,"" he told Stephanopoulos.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-oregon-court-overturns-monsantobayer-victory-roundup-trial.html,No immunity for Monsanto: Oregon court overturns Monsanto/Bayer victory in ongoing Roundup trial,"On July 10, an Oregon appeals court delivered a significant blow to Monsanto and its new owner Bayer AG. The appeals court overturned the corporation’s trial court victory in a case where Bayer sought immunity for Roundup because the product remains U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved. The EPA bases its approval of Roundup on studies that were financed by Monsanto, a blatant conflict of interest. The EPA's handling of glyphosate and Monsanto's products has been a subject of intense scrutiny, riddled with regulatory failures and deceptive influence from industry stakeholders. Recent revelations of internal documents questioning the credibility of EPA assessments have further fueled public skepticism about the agency's impartiality in evaluating health risks associated with glyphosate. Today, the cancer-causing properties of their Roundup weed killer are well documented . As lawsuits against Roundup mount, Bayer has been trying to convince regulators and legislators that they deserve immunity for their infamous herbicide. But the public isn’t buying their proposition and Bayer/Monsanto should not be above the law in a health matter that seriously affects farmers and essentially affects every person on the planet. Bayer unable to bully the public and get blanket immunity for Roundup During the trial, prosecutors identified procedural errors that led to the new ruling by the appeals courts. Specifically, the court found that the trial judge had wrongly excluded crucial evidence regarding the EPA from being presented to the jury. This exclusion potentially swayed the jury's decision against the plaintiff, highlighting the importance of a transparent presentation of all relevant information in legal proceedings that impact practically every person on the planet.

Central to Bayer's defense has been the argument of federal preemption, asserting that because Roundup carries EPA approval, state-level lawsuits alleging health risks should be preempted. Bayer has spent significant resources trying to convince state and federal legislators that glyphosate-based products should be protected. However, the court's decision aligns with previous rulings in rejecting this preemption argument, affirming the states' rights to regulate pesticides independently unless explicitly prohibited by federal law. The case in question is an attempt by Bayer to dismiss over 100,000 lawsuits nationwide, where plaintiffs claim that glyphosate-based herbicides caused or contributed to their development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These lawsuits gained momentum after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen, linking exposure to an increased risk of cancer. The original plaintiff, Larry Johnson, who used Roundup extensively around his property for over two decades, alleged that Monsanto had concealed scientific studies indicating the carcinogenic nature of its products. Similar claims across various cases suggest a pattern of deceptive practices, including allegations of ghostwriting studies and clandestine dealings with regulatory agencies like the EPA. Courts must hear all available evidence on glyphosate for an informed ruling The appeals court ruled that the exclusion of testimony from Charles Benbrook , a respected former research professor critical of the EPA's regulatory oversight of glyphosate, was compelling and warrants further investigation. Benbrook's insights could have provided the jury with a broader understanding of the regulatory framework and the limitations of industry-funded research that the EPA relies upon for its evaluations. In response to the ruling, attorney Andrew Kirkendall, representing Johnson, expressed optimism about retrying the case with the inclusion of the EPA-related evidence. He said the court's decision recognized the significance of ensuring a fair presentation of all relevant scientific and regulatory information to the jury. Bayer, now faced with the reality of a reversed trial victory, has the option to seek reconsideration from the appellate court or appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court. The outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications not only for ongoing litigation but also for future regulatory policies governing pesticide use and consumer safety in the United States.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first announced the Vaccine Injury Support Program (VISP) in December 2020, around the time that the first COVID-19 injections were approved in the country. The VISP was launched after Ottawa gave vaccine makers a shield from liability regarding COVID-19 vaccine injuries. The program's website says it seeks to ""ensure that all people in Canada who have experienced a serious and permanent injury as a result of receiving a Health Canada- authorized vaccine, administered in Canada on or after December 8, 2020, have fair and timely access to financial support."" Official data from VISP's last update on June 1 shows that a total of 2,628 individuals vaccinated for COVID-19 have filed claims. However, only 183 have been approved for compensation. The total payout sits at $14 million, meaning that each approved claimant would only receive an average of almost $78,000 in compensation. (Related: Grueling process: Canada has only settled 8 COVID-19 vaccine injury claims; HUNDREDS are still on waiting list. ) Despite claims that the COVID-19 vaccines are ""safe and effective,"" this has not stopped the Trudeau government from earmarking an extra $36 million for VISP in its 2024 budget. Health Canada has also absurdly promoted the injections as safe, even though the VISP continues to receive claims from vaccine-injured Canadians.

Ottawa still purchasing COVID-19 injections as Canadians REFUSE boosters Ottawa continues to purchase COVID-19 vaccines despite data showing that most Canadians are flat-out refusing COVID-19 boosters, according to LifeSiteNews . Those who do get deceived into getting these dangerous injections are then forced to experience the difficulty of getting compensated for their vaccine injuries. A total of 2,172 claims have been ""prepared to move forward to a preliminary medical review."" After this point, each claim goes through a lengthy process of approval. For example, 982 claims are in the process of ""collecting medical records,"" which according to VISP is ""often the longest step in the claims assessment process. There have been a total of 166 appeals made, however only eight have been approved to date by the Canadian government's Medical Review Board. Meanwhile, a total of 339 claims are ""pending administrative review for eligibility."" All Canadian provinces except Quebec are covered by VISP, which has its own vaccine compensation program that also appears to be slow at paying out to applicants. Some people who were successful in getting payouts from VISP have said that the compensation awarded was insufficient considering the injuries sustained from the COVID-19 shots. One such individual was Ross Wightman, 42, a resident of Canada's British Columbia province. Last year, he sued drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, the Canadian federal government, the provincial government and the pharmacy where he was injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. Wightman's lawsuit stemmed from what he deems as inadequate compensation from the VISP. The 42-year-old was one of the first Canadians to receive financial compensation from the federal government under the VISP due to a COVID-19 vaccine injury. He was injected with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021 but became totally paralyzed shortly after. Wightman was subsequently diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. The vaccine-injured Wightman was given a one-time payment of $250,000 and about $90,000 per year in income replacement. But according to a report by True North , he doesn't even know if the payout ""would ease the pain."" Visit VaccineInjuryNews.com for similar stories.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-18-orange-peel-compound-can-protect-against-atherosclerosis.html,Study: Compound in orange peels can protect against atherosclerosis,"Orange peels, despite being edible and highly nutritious, are usually discarded without a second thought. But a recent study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry is urging people to reconsider and take advantage of a beneficial property of orange peels. According to the study, orange peels contain an active compound that can help keep your heart healthy and protect against atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances (collectively known as plaque) along the walls of the arteries which can block blood flow to the heart. Heart disease is the number one killer in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death among men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in America. In fact, data suggests that a person dies of heart disease every 33 seconds. The most common type of heart disease is coronary heart disease (CHD) which is said to kill an estimated 375,476 people every year. CHD is caused by atherosclerosis , the buildup of plaque inside the lining of the large coronary arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Partial or complete blockage of the coronary arteries deprives the heart of much-needed oxygen, which can lead to a heart attack . Also known as myocardial infarction, a heart attack can destroy part of the heart muscle and, depending on the damage, can be fatal.

While some factors, such as age and genetics, are unavoidable, other risk factors of CHD, such as high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure, are certainly preventable. With healthy lifestyle changes, you can prevent plaque buildup in your arteries that leads to CHD. Here are some lifestyle changes that can help keep your heart and blood vessels healthy : Exercise regularly and be physically active Get enough good-quality sleep Quit smoking and avoid exposure to second-hand smoke Manage your stress levels Eat a well-balanced diet and avoid highly processed foods Research shows that being physically active strengthens your heart muscle , improving your heart's ability to pump blood throughout your body. Meanwhile, lack of sleep promotes inflammation -- a risk factor of cardiovascular disease -- which can damage your blood vessels, causing them to thicken and restrict blood flow. People who don't get enough sleep are also more prone to develop high blood pressure . Similarly, studies show that smoking or inhaling second-hand smoke can cause an instant and long-term rise in blood pressure . Smoking has also been found to damage healthy blood vessels, increase your risk of blood clots and double your risk of stroke (decreased blood flow to the brain). Meanwhile, high levels of the stress hormone cortisol can increase blood pressure, blood cholesterol and triglycerides , blood sugar and blood pressure, all of which are risk factors for heart disease. An unhealthy diet, especially one that is high in refined carbohydrates and saturated and trans fats, has been linked to atherosclerosis and consequently a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. To maintain a healthy heart and cardiovascular system, experts recommend avoiding fatty and sugary processed foods and eating more fruits, vegetables, healthy protein sources (e.g., lean meats, poultry, nuts, seafood and legumes) and whole grains. Compound in orange peel found to reduce atherosclerosis risk Earlier studies have found a connection between heart disease and the commensal bacteria residing in the human gut. One such study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology reported that gut bacteria metabolize dietary choline and carnitine -- nutrients present in animal products -- into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a compound that inhibits cholesterol metabolism, induces platelet aggregation and blood clotting , and promotes atherosclerosis. In an effort to find a solution to this, researchers from the University of Florida and the U.S. Department of Agriculture turned to orange peels, which are known for their wealth of bioactive components. They hypothesized that orange peel extracts contain natural chemicals that could prevent the production of TMAO and its precursor, trimethylamine (TMA). (Related: Oranges are waste-free: Every part has unique health benefits .) To test their hypothesis, the researchers obtained polar and non-polar fractions from orange peels and looked at how they affected TMA and TMAO production in mice and in cell cultures. They also performed chemical analysis of both fractions to identify relevant bioactive components. (Related: Scientists regard sorghum as a potential therapeutic agent against atherosclerosis .) The researchers found that the polar fraction from orange peels effectively regulated atherosclerosis-related markers and reduced TMA and TMAO in mice plasma and urine. The inhibitory effect of the polar fraction on TMA and TMAO formation was independent of changes in gut microbial composition. While the nonpolar fraction also displayed inhibitory effects, the polar fraction proved to be more effective at suppressing the formation of TMA and TMAO. The researchers attributed the polar fraction's stronger activity to the presence of a compound called feruloylputrescine. Feruloylputrescine exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against the cntA/B enzyme, which is responsible for producing TMA. In cell cultures, treatment with the polar fraction from orange peels also reduced the expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), the enzyme that converts TMA into TMAO . These findings show the considerable potential of orange peels in helping prevent heart disease . Yu Wang, one of the study authors, noted that their study highlights the unrecognized potential of feruloylputrescine and suggests that ""orange peels, often discarded as waste in the citrus industry, can be repurposed into valuable health-promoting ingredients, such as diet supplements or food ingredients."" How to incorporate orange peels into your diet Orange peels are an incredibly versatile ingredient that you can easily add to a variety of recipes. In addition to health-supporting phytonutrients, orange peels are a good source of provitamin A (precursors of vitamin A), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B9 (folate), vitamin C, calcium and dietary fiber. Orange peels can be eaten on their own (candied), added to drinks and desserts or used to flavor dishes. Here are some other ways you can use orange peels in the kitchen : Use orange zest for baking cookies or cakes Sprinkle orange zest onto salads, oatmeal, etc. Mix orange zest with coarse sea salt to make orange salt (you can use this to season vegetables, rice, soups, etc.) Mince and dry orange peels and combine with tea leaves and spices Add orange peels to roasted dishes or use them to stuff chicken Use orange peels to make marmalade Steep orange peels in vodka for several days to make orange-cello The flesh of oranges is not the only useful part of this citrus fruit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-17-redfield-mandating-covid-19-injections-greatest-mistake.html,Former CDC director: Mandating COVID-19 injections one of the GREATEST MISTAKES ever made,"The erstwhile head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed that mandating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections was one of the greatest mistakes ever made . Former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield made this admission during a July 12 hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. The committee's hearing centered on government oversight of taxpayer-funded high-risk virus research. ""I do think one of the greatest mistakes that was made, of course, was mandating these vaccines,"" he told senators. ""They should have never been mandated. It should have been open to personal choice."" Redfield, who led the CDC from 2018 to 2021, also admitted that the spike protein produced by mRNA vaccines is ""toxic to the body"" and triggers ""a very strong pro-inflammatory response."" According to the former Trump administration official, he doesn't administer mRNA vaccines in his clinical practice – preferring ""killed protein vaccines"" instead. He also declared biosecurity as America's ""greatest national security threat."" Moreover, Redfield called for a pause on gain-of-function research. (Related: COVID jabs induce 723x more brain clots than flu shots, shocking study finds. ) ""I'm not aware of any advanced therapeutic or vaccine that has come to pass because of gain-of-function research. I do think there has to be a very aggressive debate of whether there's any benefit from that research,"" he remarked. ""Based on my initial analysis, I believe then, and I still believe today, that the COVID-19 infections were the direct result of a biomedical research experiment and subsequent lab leak.""

The Defender noted in a July 12 piece about the former CDC head's testimony: ""Redfield's statements stand in stark contrast to the CDC's official stance during his tenure, which strongly promoted mRNA vaccine uptake as safe and effective. The late admission of vaccine injuries underscores the failure of public health agencies and the medical establishment to provide informed consent to the billions of vaccine recipients worldwide."" Redfield calls on FDA to release all safety data it has During the same hearing, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) pressed Redfield on the issue of health agencies suppressing data about the COVID-19 vaccines . He highlighted concerning data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System that showed over 37,000 deaths reported after COVID-19 vaccination. Of this total, 24 percent of vaccine deaths occurred within two days of injection. In response, Redfield acknowledged that there was ""no appropriate transparency from the beginning about the potential side effects of these vaccines."" He criticized attempts to ""under-report any side effects because they argued that would make the public less likely to get vaccinated."" The former official also expressed disappointment toward the Food and Drug Administration 's (FDA) handling of vaccine safety information. ""The FDA should release all of the safety data they have. I was very disappointed to hear that they were planning to hold on to that until 2026. That really creates a sense of total lack of trust in our public health agencies toward vaccination,"" said Redfield. Johnson displayed a chart comparing adverse event reports for various drugs, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, to those for COVID-19 vaccines. The stark contrast in reported deaths from these therapeutics – with COVID-19 vaccines showing significantly higher numbers – fueled Johnson's demand for more transparency. ""As important as the cover-up of the origin story is, there's a lot more that’s being covered up,"" Johnson asserted. ""The public has a right to know. We pay for these agencies. We pay their salaries. We fund these studies."" Head over to Vaccines.news for more stories about COVID-19 vaccines.

Conservative filmmaker Robby Starbuck revealed the discovery, alongside John Deere's other woke endeavors under its CEO John May, in a July 9 video on X . He lamented how the company, ""one of the most beloved brands by conservative farmers,"" has ""gone woke"" under May's watch. The woke endeavors Starbuck outlined include the funding of a Pride event for kids as young as three years old. According to LGBT outlet Pink News , the event he pertained to was the Little Rainbow Run. It was a fun run for children aged three to six, which was concurrently held at the Capital City Pride event in Des Moines, Iowa last month. The director of the documentary ""The War on Children"" also disclosed the existence of LGBT and race-based identity groups at John Deere's corporate offices. Aside from these, he also shared that employees were asked to list their ""preferred pronouns"" on all communications. They were also required to undergo LGBT training using the ""genderbread man"" model – similar to the earlier ""gender unicorn"" model. According to Starbuck, ""the woke policies have spread across the global John Deere brand – with many of their DEI policies also being forced on [its] Latin America and India branches."" This also coincides with John Deere announcing layoffs in the U.S. and plans to shift large segments of production from the U.S. to Mexico, he added.

""To put it mildly, John Deere seems to have forgotten who [its] customers are,"" Starbuck said. ""Having a farm myself, I'm disgusted that a once great American brand is now taking this turn to seemingly embrace leftist policies that are diametrically opposed to the values of most farmers."" Starbuck urges John Deere customers to SPEAK OUT The filmmaker continued: ""What's unknown is whether … May is knowingly forcing these policies, or if it's gotten out of control and he's out of the loop on how bad it is. His response to this story will be very revealing as to his culpability in the implementation of woke policies."" According to Starbuck, the initial report ""is only the beginning"" and a follow-up that would ""take weeks, maybe even months to report"" is in the pipeline. He plans to report his discoveries piece by piece ""so customers and potential customers are informed on the brand’s policies."" ""If [it's] proud of adopting woke policies, then John Deere and [its] CEO should be overjoyed by my reporting on their policies, positions, donations and culture."" Starbuck then turned to his viewers, urging them to speak out if they believe John Deere's values don't align with theirs. He provided the company's email and corporate customer service number, albeit adding a caveat for those who want to voice out their displeasure. ""Please, always be respectful and remember that many of the employees disagree with the corporate policies. The majority of your local dealers likely also disagree with this culture change, so be very respectful if you reach our to them about your concerns,"" Starbuck said. ""My goal with this reporting is never destruction. My goal is to inform consumers about the values major companies are adopting so they can make choices about what they’re willing to support. When we use our voices and wallets to vote our values, we can change the world and we can restore great American companies to a culture of sanity, meritocracy and culture war neutrality, or we can inspire competitors to step up to the plate to fight for our business.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-17-new-ai-powered-camera-assess-driver-intoxication.html,New AI-powered in-vehicle camera technology will assess driver intoxication,"A tech startup is developing an artificial intelligence-powered in-vehicle camera that can assess a driver's level of intoxication as soon as they get into the car . The new system, which seeks to reduce drunk driving accidents, was presented in a paper published on April 9 at a joint conference by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Computer Vision Foundation. According to the presentation, the in-development AI algorithm utilizes a single color camera to monitor variables such as gaze direction and head position. It incorporates 3D and infrared footage of the driver's face, rearview videos showing driver posture, steering interactions, event logs and screen recordings of driving behavior. The researchers, along with the South African software company MiX by Powerfleet, used video footage of drivers of various ages, drinking habits and driving experience, as well as simulators under three levels of intoxication: sober, low intoxication and severely intoxicated. The algorithm identified common visual cues of intoxication, such as bloodshot eyes, a flushed face, droopy eyelids and a dazed look to assess the driver's intoxication level as soon as they get into the car. (Related: Government developing AI-powered surveillance program that can keep an eye on people in smart cities .) ""Our system has the capability to identify intoxication levels at the beginning of a drive, allowing for the potential prevention of impaired drivers from being on the road,"" said Ensiyeh Keshtkaran, a project contributor and doctoral student at Edith Cowan University (ECU) in Perth, Western Australia.

WHO: Driving under the influence of alcohol a major contributor to road traffic injuries A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report has revealed that approximately 1.19 million people worldwide lose their lives each year due to road traffic crashes. Driving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances is a major contributor to road traffic injuries, with the risk of accidents rising considerably with higher blood alcohol concentrations in drivers . In fact, a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notes that even a small amount of alcohol can affect driving ability. In 2022, 2,337 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes where an offending driver had blood alcohol concentrations of between .01 to .07 grams per deciliter – below the benchmark of .08 grams per deciliter that is illegal in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In 2022, a total of 13,524 people in the United States died from alcohol-impaired driving deaths, which amounts to 37 people per day, or one person every 39 minutes.

Kennedy Jr. has apologized after his son posted a video recording of a recent phone call with his Republican challenger, Donald Trump. During the call, Trump sought RFK Jr.’s endorsement and said that he shared the independent’s concerns about vaccinating children. (Article republished from RT.com ) An excerpt of the call, which took place on Sunday, was briefly posted to X on Tuesday by Bobby Kennedy III. It was deleted shortly afterwards. According to screenshots, the younger Kennedy posted the video as he felt “these sorts of conversations should be had in public.” In the video, Trump told the elder Kennedy that “clearly something’s wrong” with the US’ childhood vaccination program. “I said I want to do small doses,” Trump told Kennedy Jr. Children are given a “vaccination that’s like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a ten-pound or twenty-pound baby. And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change…and then you hear that doesn’t have an impact,” he complained. “You and I talked about that a long time ago,” Trump added.

I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president.” Kennedy Jr. did not speak during the section of the call posted online. After laying out his views on vaccines, Trump appeared to ask for the independent candidate’s endorsement, telling him “it would be so good for you.” Trump met with Kennedy Jr. the day after the phone call to discuss his possibly suspending his bid for the White House and joining the Republican’s campaign, Politico reported on Monday. The Kennedy campaign acknowledged that the meeting took place but said that the two discussed “national unity,” and that Kennedy Jr. would remain in the race. Recent polls show Kennedy Jr. winning around 10% of the national vote in a hypothetical race that includes the Green Party’s Jill Stein and the Justice for All Party’s Cornel West. These same polls show Trump leading President Joe Biden by between one and six points. Read more at: RT.com"

Now we have data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to back up that claim. According to the government-run VAERS, Moderna's mRNA shots generate 30 percent more death reports than Pfizer. Early on, Kirsch estimated based on VAERS data that Moderna's injection kills about 50 percent more people than Pfizer's, with Johnson & Johnson's viral vector COVID-19 vaccine being even deadlier than both the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Using a new technique that compares the all-cause mortality (ACM) rates of different injection brands distributed to the Czech Republic, Kirsch was able to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that COVID injections in general ""caused unacceptable increases in all-cause mortality for those who opted for the shots.""

Kirsch presents various imagery on his website illustrating the differences in death rates between Pfizer and Moderna , explaining that never in his life has he seen a vaccine ""that has created so many vaccine deaths and injuries."" ""And most of them are from the Pfizer vaccine,"" he emphasizes, since Pfizer produced and released the most shots compared to all of the other brands. ""Other vaccines have far more doses than the COVID vaccines, but the COVID vaccines are the worst as far as reported deaths. How can they explain that?"" Even in Pfizer's own ""gold standard"" trials, the data patently shows that deaths in the vaccine group far exceeded at all times deaths in the placebo group – and the same is true for Moderna. How, then, can the vaccine hawks continue to claim ""safe and effective"" for these things? It was revealed on July 11, 2024, via the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF) that any health epidemiologist who tries to come forward to blow the whistle about all this is ""rewarded"" with firing or worse: charged with false criminal charges – watch the video below: Kirsch believes that not a single health authority anywhere has bothered to take the time to look at the ACM rates one year from the time when patients were injected with various COVID jab brands. If they would, they would quickly see the same things Kirsch is seeing. Kirsch cites numerous examples, including Health New Zealand , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the Santa Clara Public Health Department, all of which rejected his efforts to present them with truthful data about the deadly shots. ""All the doctors who told you that the Moderna vaccine was safe misled you. And the media, lawmakers, public health officials, and U.S. Presidents all told you this s--- was safe without hard data showing it was safe."" If you don't want to potentially die early, it is probably best to never inject yourself with any kind of mRNA. Learn more at VaccineDeaths.com . "
